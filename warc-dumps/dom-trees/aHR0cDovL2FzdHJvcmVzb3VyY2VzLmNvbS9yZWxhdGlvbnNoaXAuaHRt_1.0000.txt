<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">This 
astrological report looks at your birth charts to see how the two of you will 
tend to interact in dating, a love affair, or -- especially -- in a long-term 
partnership like marriage. Its aim is to make you more conscious of what’s 
really going on between you. As you read, you’ll get a better appreciation of 
what each of you wants and needs when you pair off with someone else. Regarding 
your relationship with this particular partner, you’ll see strengths that you 
can cultivate, and also learn about the possible problems that could get in the 
way of your happiness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">If 
you read about problems, don’t worry. Almost every astrological combination has 
both positive and negative possibilities. You’ll read about the ways people tend 
to misuse various astrological combinations, but you may never experience these 
negative sides. Much depends on other things in your chart and on the way you’re 
handling what’s been given to you. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">The 
important thing is to be aware of your choices. As you read, you’ll see that 
when faced with virtually any so-called problem between the two of you, you can 
choose a desirable or an undesirable way to act. This report will try to show 
you where the problem is coming from, and suggest constructive things that you 
can do. It will also alert you to the strengths that you can build upon to 
create an increasingly strong and satisfying relationship.</span></p>

<b><i>Your Styles of Relating</i></b><i>.</i> We’ll first look at each of you as 
individuals. We’ll start with your basic personality type, and then look more 
closely at your needs and attitudes regarding romance, partnership and sex. Your 
section is addressed to you as an individual, but if your partner also reads it, 
he or she may better understand your overall approach to life and the way you go 
about relating to people. <br>

the way you see your partner is shaped by the lens of your own horoscope. <br>

<b><i>The Dynamics between You.</i></b> Here we’ll look at the kinds of dramas

<b><i>The Chart of the Relationship Itself</i></b><i>.</i> Finally, we’ll 
analyze the relationship itself by combining the birth charts of each of you 
into a single “composite chart.” When your relationship is well established, the 
composite chart shows how you as a couple approach the rest of the world, and 
how you’re viewed as a result of being together.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:22.0pt;color:black">For Brad: Your Style of Relating</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
To find someone who’s right for you and then form a happy and lasting 
relationship, you first need to have a sense of who you really are and what you 
need and want. A look at your own birth chart will show where your strengths are 
and what you tend to lack. It can give you perspective on your own nature, 
helping you to make allowances for the blind spots that can harm your 
interactions with others. It can also give clues about what sort of love partner 
would make you feel most happy and complete. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b>
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><br>
Your Basic Character </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
You have many planets in Earth signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
With an abundance of Earth symbolism in your chart, you’re probably quite 
down-to-earth in a psychological sense. Before you act, you look for reasons. To 
clarify where you stand and to motivate you to initiate, you like people to 
explain the situation complete with concrete examples. Because you wish your 
actions to be based on the facts, your insistence on practical reasons for 
initiating could sometimes make you seem callous. Also, you may need to know 
what’s in it for you. This, too, could make you appear unfeeling. However, if 
you consciously do your duty, and assist the significant others in your life to 
reach their goals, they will see how useful and important you can be in their 
lives. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">It 
can be hard for you to take unfamiliar routes, so you tend to be habit-oriented. 
Though repeated patterns may provide security, they can also become boring. One 
way to deal with this is to make lists of actions you might take, and, among 
them, consider some new alternatives. Starting in this way with small changes 
can lead to greater moves. It’s also good to have a partner who can help you to 
stretch your boundaries without pushing you too far, too fast. Whether you 
motivate yourself or get help from others, when change is necessary, the keyword 
is “gradual.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
<br>
You have few or no planets in Air signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
An overall lack of the Air element in your chart suggests that you tend to have 
little patience with people who are vague and abstract in their communications. 
You want people to get quickly to the point. Preferring actions to words, you 
want to see progress, not listen to or create elaborate plans. Because of this, 
you may find it difficult to visualize the general overview of any project. 
Perhaps you could join forces with someone who can guide you along the correct 
path while you concentrate on small segments of it. You may have to suffer 
through some seemingly unnecessary verbiage, but if you attain your goal, it 
will all seem worthwhile.<br>
</span><b><span style="color:black">
<br>
You have few or no planets in Water signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
An overall lack of Water symbolism in your chart suggests that you seldom rely 
on your intuition to guide you through life. Also, because you don’t easily 
express emotion, you may not seem very sensitive to others. Contrary to popular 
belief, however, you do have feelings. You just don’t have universal compassion, 
nor are you comfortable in emotional situations. Therefore, emotional outbursts 
are not the way to reach you. In fact, if someone tries to get your attention 
with tears or anger, you’ll quickly turn off. If you pick a compassionate 
partner, you may have to tolerate a little demonstrativeness, but you also may 
learn to express your own feelings better.<br>
</span><b><span style="color:black">
<br>
You have few planets in Fixed signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You may not always follow through to the bitter end, and you could be accused of 
being undirected. If you look too far ahead, you could feel so overwhelmed that 
you either stop what you’re doing or never begin. One way to ensure completion 
is to concentrate on the task at hand. It’s also good to have a partner who will 
help you to focus and to finish what you start. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">If 
all else fails, and your critics become extremely vocal, point out how agreeable 
you are. Remind them that you’re either puttering around on your own (Cardinal) 
or going along with their ideas (Mutable), or possibly both.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Your Sun is in Sagittarius.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your Sun in Sagittarius reinforces the idea that you’re generally outgoing and 
full of enthusiasm. Overall, you like to have a good time, and you enjoy being 
with those who also like fun and games. But your enthusiasm sometimes gets you 
into trouble. It can cause you to speak before you think, so that you can hurt 
other people’s feelings without realizing it. Some may describe you as honest 
and refreshing, but those who’ve been the object of your remarks might think of 
you as tactless. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">You 
can tell whether you’ve hurt someone’s feelings by noting their response. It 
could be verbal, in the form of a sharp retort, or physical, through a hurt or 
angry facial expression or some other kind of body language. If you become 
sensitive to these responses, you can use your sense of humor to come back 
quickly with a joke or in some other way alleviate the tension. A partner who 
stays with you in spite of your tactlessness must have learned that you can 
change your mind in five minutes. You just tend to think out loud. Or, possibly, 
he or she finds that your frankness adds to your charm. Still, it wouldn’t be a 
bad idea for you to try to be a little more considerate. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">One 
of your strengths is a strong desire to grow and develop. Learning appeals to 
you, and you could consider yourself the perennial student. You may choose to 
learn through formal education, distant travel or interaction with others.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Because you’re always looking for ways to broaden yourself, you may be drawn to 
partners who are from a different background than your own. This is an excellent 
way to gather information about other cultures and points of view. It is not, 
however, necessary to form a liaison with someone from a foreign country. You 
may just want someone to travel with, or a person with whom you can share your 
philosophical and religious views. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">The 
crucial thing for you in a partnership is that you grow because of the 
association. Although you want to develop with and through your partner, 
however, you probably don’t want 24-hour-a-day togetherness. You need some 
freedom and space. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Nevertheless, you should have at least one activity that you share, because if 
you don’t have any interests in common you could grow in different directions 
and ultimately have nothing to hold the relationship together. The activities 
that you’re involved in jointly can help form the bond between you. Also, when 
you’re together, discuss your separate experiences. You’ll then have your 
freedom, your togetherness and your personal development, and both of you will 
be enriched. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Your Moon is in Capricorn.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your Capricorn Moon adds an extra-strong sense of duty. You may tend to do 
things not because you want to, but because you’re supposed to. If 
your mother is around, you may feel a sense of duty toward her. Or you may have 
learned to do your duty by your mother’s example. She may have been a 
responsible, take-charge sort of person, and you may be following in her 
footsteps. Alternatively, your mother could have been just the opposite. If she 
had a hard time coping and needed help, you may have had to learn to take care 
of her and her responsibilities. Either way, you ended up becoming a reliable 
and responsible person. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Nowadays, you take this sense of responsibility into your relationships, 
particularly into your emotional commitments. You may feel responsible for the 
other person’s emotional state, and make special efforts to nurture and shore up 
your partner. If you’re uncomfortable with your own emotions, however, you may 
find yourself being judgmental about your partner’s emotional excesses. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">The 
image that you’d like to project to the outer world is one of emotional 
steadfastness, not gushiness. You may therefore be emotionally undemonstrative 
in public, and get embarrassed when someone shows you affection in front of 
other people. (We will not, however, comment on how you might behave in the 
privacy of your own home. . . .We’ll let your partner do that!) You can discuss 
feelings more easily if it’s done not in an emotional manner, but rather from a 
practical perspective. Instead of using tears or anger, your partner will be 
more likely to reach you with concrete examples and suggestions. You might also 
become more demonstrative if there are good enough reasons. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">If 
you have a very emotionally expressive or volatile partner, you may have a hard 
time relating to this. Alternatively, it’s possible that you’ll be attracted to 
someone <i>because</i> their emotions are very much out there and on the 
surface. Such a partner may be able to do the expressing that you secretly wish 
you could do yourself. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">One 
of your more useful attributes is your ability to take charge when an emergency 
arises. You can keep your head even when those around you are losing theirs. 
This is because the practical side of your nature automatically responds in 
emotional situations. You tend to do the logical thing without stopping to think 
about it. You may later analyze what you did and figure out how you could have 
done better, but considering how quickly you responded, no one would have 
expected more from you. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Not 
only can you handle critical situations well, you’ll also usually come through 
dependably in everyday situations. If you’ve made a commitment or feel that 
something is your responsibility, you’ll be inclined to keep the promises you 
make, and you’ll tend to take care of matters that you say you’ll handle. You 
may not move as quickly as you do in emergencies, but eventually you’ll take 
care of your duties. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">All 
of this should somewhat compensate your partner even if you’re not as 
emotionally demonstrative as he or she would like. One way in which you <i>can</i> 
comfortably show your feelings is through material gifts. Giving something 
special, and possibly expensive, is known to make many a partner feel loved. You 
can also show your thoughtfulness by doing things to care for your partner’s 
practical needs. Also, while you may not be publicly demonstrative, you may well 
compensate for this by being unexpectedly playful and affectionate in private.

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><br>
Your Axis of Relationship</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The horizontal line that separates the upper half of your chart from the lower 
half symbolizes the horizon. It suggests two arms reaching out, and it is in 
fact your “axis of relationship.” On the left-hand or eastern side of your chart 
there is the Ascendant (or rising sign), which signifies you and the way that 
you present yourself to others. On the right-hand or western side there is the 
Descendant, which signifies the sort of partner you’ll be drawn to and who will 
make you feel more complete. The two work together: any discussion of your 
rising sign (you) implies your setting sign (the partner who will complement 
you). <br>
If the birth time for your chart is accurate, you have Sagittarius rising. This 
means that you tend to approach the world with a questing spirit, and that you 
have a thirst to expand your horizons through means such as education and 
travel. You like to explore, and love the thought of adventure. To pursue such 
interests, you need a certain amount of freedom, which makes you seek out people 
who can “go with the flow.” You’re not looking for a partner who will try to 
saddle you with heavy responsibilities, but rather someone who can move along 
with you, and at least occasionally let you move along alone. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">In 
this search for knowledge or adventure, you may sometimes operate independently 
and forget to consider the other person. If you only develop your own interests 
and permit your partner to do the same, you could eventually discover that the 
two of you have so little left in common that there’s not much to hold the 
relationship together. Though you each need your individual interests, to make 
the relationship meaningful you also need some togetherness. Work on sharing at 
least one activity. For example, you probably both enjoy travel. Your partner 
might prefer short trips and you long, but if you compromise and do some of 
both, each of you can be happy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Even 
though you like to roam freely, you do have a flexibility that enables you to 
make compromises to honor your partner’s wishes. If you’re too adaptable, 
however, you might feel that you’ve built your relationship upon shifting sands. 
People like you do need just a bit of stability. Your solution is to base your 
partnership on an established philosophy of life. This philosophy should be 
broad enough to encompass operating in the immediate environment (which your 
partner needs) as well as in the wider and less practical ones (which you need). 
Then, as issues arise in your relationship, you’ll have a joint philosophy 
against which to weigh your decisions. This should provide guidance without 
making you feel too limited. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Although you and your partner may both have an intellectual curiosity, your 
partner’s is probably more quickly and easily satisfied than yours. Your partner 
may be more interested in grasping the bare bones of something, while you may 
want to understand the essence and all the ramifications. Because of the 
differences in your attitude and approach to intellectual matters, your partner 
may view you as long- winded, and you may think of your partner as superficial. 
But there’s something you can learn from each other. You can broaden your 
partner’s perspective, if you do it in small doses, remembering that your 
partner probably doesn’t have the patience to digest too much information at one 
sitting. And your partner may convince you that the abridged version has its 
place, too. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
<br>
Dating and Romance </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
To take a look at your specific approach to romance, partnership and sex, we’re 
now going to look at the houses that govern these areas in your chart. These 
houses describe both what you have to give to a relationship, and also what you 
probably want from your partner. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Relationships start with a period when you’re checking each other out, and 
aren’t yet really committed. This stage is covered by your Fifth House, which 
also has to do with amusements and self-expression. In a romance, the Fifth 
House shows how you wine and dine each other in the dating stage. Having fun 
together in a romantic setting helps you to get the relationship off the ground.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">When 
you’re married, this area of your chart turns into the place where you refresh 
and renew both yourself and your relationship. To keep the spark glowing, it’s a 
good idea periodically to let go of your duties, play, be romantic and even a 
bit outrageous. If you neglect this essential human need, it can be filled by 
romances outside of marriage, risky activities like gambling, or escapes like 
drinking or drugs, which are other less satisfactory ways that this house can 
find expression. For longevity and happiness in any relationship, you need to 
keep the fun, romance and playful element alive. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">On a 
deeper level, the Fifth House is where you come to establish yourself as an 
individual. Through being brave and taking risks, through finding what 
activities and people make you happy, through games and role-playing, and 
through expressing yourself (all Fifth-House activities), you come to know who 
you really are. Only after you’ve done this are you really ready to commit 
yourself to a Seventh-House relationship such as marriage. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Each 
house brings in a variety of symbolic themes, as shown by the sign on the 
beginning or cusp of the house, other signs falling within the house, planets 
within the house, and the planet that traditionally “rules” the sign on the 
cusp. For your relationship to find its fullest expression, it’s important that, 
in your interactions together, both of you try to express as many of the 
following themes as possible. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Aries is on your Fifth-House cusp.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Aries on your Fifth cusp suggests that you want action in your romantic 
relationships. Either you like to be assertive yourself, or you’re drawn to 
others who like to take the lead. At least at the start of your courtship, you 
enjoy spontaneity and tend to focus on immediate gratification rather than 
long-term implications. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Taurus is within the Fifth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
As the relationship progresses, you’ll start to concentrate on more long-lasting 
goals. You may increasingly want your romantic partner to be dependable, 
trustworthy and totally yours. In return, you’ll tend to behave this way also, 
so that in your ideal romance the reliability and fidelity go both ways. Also, 
sensual pleasure -- enjoying anything you can see, taste, smell, hear or touch 
-- becomes increasingly important, so that you’ll want someone who will indulge 
you and also whom you can indulge. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Mars, the ruler of your Fifth House, is in the Second</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The planet that’s traditionally associated with the sign on the Fifth-House cusp 
brings in additional considerations. Placed in the Second House, it means that 
security could be an important issue even in the courtship stage. The idea of 
belonging to each other really appeals to you, and so you’re hardly frivolous in 
your romantic attachments. In fact, the idea of belonging could be so strong 
that possessiveness might enter the picture if you feel insecure. You also will 
view the relationship realistically, evaluating it from a practical perspective. 
Even if other factors in your chart indicate that you have a vivid imagination, 
you won’t spend a lot of time fantasizing about your romance because material 
considerations are never totally out of the picture.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">You don’t have any planets in your Fifth House. All this means is that dating 
and romance may take a less crucial role in your life than they might for 
someone else. The good thing is that your requirements are less specific, so 
that you can select from a wider range of potential playmates. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Becoming Partners</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The Seventh House is traditionally the house of marriage. It covers any 
relationship in which you pick one partner, face each other directly, and work 
out a relationship of equals that will endure over time. The Seventh also 
signifies any relationship where you confront each other one-on-one or where 
you’re yoked together and asked to pull as a team. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">To 
do this successfully, you need to adjust your own energies so that they find a 
balance with your partner’s, and neither person is dominated by the other. This 
means finding the right balance between self-assertion and compromise. To 
achieve happiness together, you need to deal with differences and resolve power 
struggles in a way that respects the rights and individuality of you both. Open 
communication is essential. There can be battles along the way, but the goal is 
an enduring relationship in which the two of you know each other thoroughly, 
each get your fair share, and develop mutual trust and respect. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Gemini is on your Seventh-House cusp.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You want a partner who is sociable and has a variety of interests. Because your 
partner is so diversified, he or she could sometimes seem shallow and/or 
scattered. But if you can flit along together happily, this might be an asset 
rather than a liability, especially when the alternative to superficiality is 
boredom. You may sometimes yearn for intellectual conversations, but this could 
be difficult because one or both of you may have a short attention span. 
However, it’s not impossible. One way to handle this problem, should it arise, 
is to divide the discussion into segments, with breaks for physical exercise or 
snacks, or possibly a party. The ability to fit into many different types of 
groups is one of the qualities that attracted you, and watching your partner in 
action may remind you of your blessings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
The sign Cancer is within the Seventh House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
For you, nurturing is also important in any long-term partnership. If just one 
of you is doing the mothering, however, the other may end up playing the child. 
The partner who always takes the role of the child can feel smothered, leading 
to tantrums or a desire to escape the overbearing “parent.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">If 
you see this happening, try giving each other some extra tender, loving care, of 
course -- but be sure to take turns playing mother and child. If you feel that 
you’re doing all the protecting, let you partner know your needs. Reveal your 
vulnerability, and ask for some reassurance and security now and then. If you’re 
the one who’s feeling smothered by an overprotective partner, try turning things 
around and being the nurturer yourself. When you switch roles like this, you’ll 
re-establish the equality that is so essential in a happy relationship.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Mercury, the ruler of your Seventh House, is in the Second</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
In your chart the planet that is traditionally associated with the sign on your 
Seventh-House cusp is placed in the Second House. This suggests that you want a 
marriage founded on security, financial and emotional. As a couple you’ll put 
much energy into creating a sound financial base. You see yourselves as a team, 
dealing with the practical aspects of life, and building a secure foundation for 
living. The possessions you accumulate together become the material expression 
of your relatedness, and contemplating them may remind you of your closeness and 
love. More than most people, you feel that you belong to each other. When this 
becomes excessive, you may have to curb your emotional possessiveness and 
remember to see your partner as more than a prized possession. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Every planet that a person has in the Seventh House would indicate at least one 
additional requirement for them in a close one-to-one relationship. You have no 
planets here, however. For you, close partnerships may not be the all-consuming 
concern that they might be to someone who has a full Seventh House. This means 
that you could actually have an easier time finding a marriage partner. Your 
requirements in a partner are apt to be looser, and so you can be open to a 
greater variety of people. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Entwining Souls </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Ideally, in the Fifth House you gained a sense of who you are and who you want, 
and in the Seventh you learned how to enter into a partnership without 
sacrificing your individuality. In the Eighth House you’re called upon to 
surrender that self so as to merge with your partner fully. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">This 
surrender commonly takes the form of sex, but it can be other forms of deep 
involvement as well. On a material level, it can mean pooling your possessions 
and finances. Essentially, this house is where you loosen your grasp on what you 
once thought necessary, and in doing so, merge into a deeper and larger self 
that goes beyond your own individuality. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">The 
Seventh House allowed you to work out power struggles through open communication 
and adherence to the rules of fairness. Eighth- House power struggles are 
sneakier because they arise from unconscious depths. They often result in an 
attempt to force surrender rather than allow the other person to render it up 
freely. To resolve these struggles, you need to open yourself to your own 
deepest emotions and those of your partner. When emotion is respected and given 
its due in a non-violent way, Eighth-House struggles can eventually lead to 
relationships of enormous tenderness and depth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Regarding sex, most people have more than one sign influencing their Eighth 
House, and many also have one or more planets in the Eighth. This multiplies 
possible avenues for sexual expression. Finding ways to combine all these 
energies can lead to the kind of sex that most satisfies you. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
The sign Cancer is on your Eighth-House cusp.</span></b><span style="color:
black"><br>
Having the homey, nest-making sign Cancer on your Eighth-House cusp suggests 
that you need a good deal of security in your sex life. Not only do you need it, 
you can provide it as well. You tend to mother your sexual partners, so that 
food or making your partner feel comfortable and cozy could be an important part 
of your sexual ritual. You want some of this treatment also, so it’s best if you 
alternate playing the mother. If one partner does all the nurturing and gets 
nothing in return, emotional outbursts could interfere with your sex life. 
Making the nurturing reciprocal can result in sex that is both tender and highly 
satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
<br>
The sign Leo is within the Eighth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
There’s also a stagey and flamboyant side to your sex life. Since you’re going 
to be the star of the show, the entire production may need to be planned. You 
want the setting to be just right: romantic and inviting, perhaps even lavish. 
You may not be able to write the entire script, but at the very least you want a 
partner who adores or at least appreciates you. You could be missing a large 
audience to applaud your efforts, but with the right co-star, background and 
props, your sex life should be glorious!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
<br>
The Moon, the ruler of your Eighth House, is in the Second</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The placement of your Eighth-House ruler in the house of possessions suggests 
that for you, good sex is strongly connected with your sense of security. The 
more insecure you are, the more effort you’ll put into sex. Also, if there are 
any difficulties with your sexual partner, this could affect your sense of 
self-worth. As in most relationship matters, it takes two to participate and two 
to keep it going. Don’t take sole credit for your sexual successes, but also 
don’t take total blame for the failures. By analyzing any problems with your 
partner, you each can find ways of enhancing your sex life together.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black">How You See Angelina</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
No matter how objective you think you are, the way you see others is always 
affected by your own necessarily limited point of view. Becoming conscious of 
your own possible biases in viewing your partner can often be very helpful in in 
overcoming misunderstandings and in avoiding thwarted expectations. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">&nbsp;One 
of the main things that will describe your own personal way of seeing Angelina 
is the way her planets fall into the houses in your own chart. The houses show 
how the heavens looked from the spot on earth where you were born. Not only do 
they provide the framework through which you experience your own planets, they 
also provide the structure through which you’ll view Angelina’s planets as well.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">When 
one of Angelina’s planets falls into a particular house in your chart, you will 
tend to associate her expression of that planetary energy with the department of 
life represented by that house. This may or may not agree with how she views 
that planetary energy in herself. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Looking at it another way, you could think of Angelina’s planets as “lighting 
up” your houses, bringing additional energy to the areas of life that those 
houses deal with. By filling in the empty houses in your chart, she may make you 
feel more complete. By adding planets to your already-filled houses, she can 
further emphasize those areas of existence. By adding different planets to a 
house, she can introduce new possibilities into those areas of your life. 
Besides suggesting how you will experience Angelina and how you will feel about 
her, looking at her planets will suggest the functions that Angelina will tend 
to take on in your total scheme of things. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">
Houses, of course, divide the chart into twelve specific areas. Before getting 
into that much detail, we can check out your overall perception of Angelina 
simply by the way her planets are clustered in the main areas of your chart. <br>
The fact that more of Angelina’s planets fall into the right-hand half of your 
chart suggests that you tend to view her primarily as a responder. You may not 
expect her to take the initiative, and you could see her as slow or indecisive 
when initiative and decisiveness are necessary. You might think that if you left 
taking action to her, you’d never do anything as a couple. You might therefore 
do things like accept invitations or set your social calendar without consulting 
with this partner. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">If 
neither of you minds this, fine. But, if your partner resents not having a say 
in what’s happening, chances are that her own chart indicates that she’s 
basically an initiator. You don’t have to give up the reins entirely, but you 
might discuss the matter and together determine areas where your partner can be 
in charge. You might even enjoy not having to make all the decisions.<br>
<br>
With Angelina’s planets being balanced fairly equally above and below your 
horizon, you’ll probably see her as sometimes being socially oriented, adjusting 
to the world and needing its approval, and at other times wanting to be alone, 
being introspective and caring more about self-approval or personal 
gratification than public opinion. If you view this as inconsistency, you could 
consider the situation impossible, and just complain about your partner’s 
attitudes instead of trying to influence them. If you see it as flexibility, 
you’ll then try various approaches to influencing her attitudes, and you will 
eventually succeed. </span></p>

How Angelina Affects Specific Areas of Your Life </span></b>
<span style="color:black"><br>
For more detailed information, let’s now look at specific planets in specific 
houses. The houses that will probably be most important in forming your view of 
Angelina are those that contain her Sun and Moon. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Sun is in your Seventh House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You’ll probably experience Angelina as warm and outgoing, particularly in your 
relationship. When the two of you are with close friends, however, you may see 
her as more visible than you. You might well bask in the light of her 
personality and enjoy other people’s perception of her , but it’s also possible 
to develop an inferiority complex because you believe that she outshines you. 
You might even become resentful because you feel that she is self-centered and 
hogs the limelight. If you remember that this is your subjective opinion, you 
can more actively participate, and you may discover that you can shine just as 
brightly as your partner.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Moon is in your Fourth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You may see Angelina as taking a mothering role, or you find that she is prone 
to emotional outbursts at home. Though the outer world may view this person as 
calm or stable, when you’re in your nest together, feelings come pouring out. It 
is good to have emotional freedom in your private life, but if you sometimes 
wonder why you have to bear the brunt of all this, the answer is that you don’t. 
If this behavior happens often, it may be because your partner is feeling 
insecure and needs some tender, loving care. If you provide some nurturing, you 
will not only make your partner happier, you might also get some mothering in 
return.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Mercury is in your Seventh House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You probably perceive Angelina as a person who can communicate well on the 
social scene. She may never seem at a loss for words and can chat about almost 
any subject, at least for a short period of time. For longer conversations, or 
deeper ones, you may have to look elsewhere. But there are definite advantages 
to this placement. One is that you always have something to say to each other. 
Another is that you know that your partner can fit in with anyone she chooses. 
If you want to discuss serious and/or deep subjects with your partner, do it in 
small doses. For example, you can talk about and resolve a problem, but it’s 
best done in several short conversations instead of one long one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Venus is in your Eighth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Angelina’s looks or general attractiveness and sexy, affectionate manner may 
really turn you on. In fact, she may be so desirable in this area that you want 
to keep it a secret. You could fear that if someone else finds her attractive, 
she could be stolen away. And, in your worst nightmares, you could see her as 
being <i>willingly</i> stolen! Instead of ruining this heaven with worrying, 
take each moment of enjoyment as it comes. Freely give back what you’re getting, 
and Angelina could have such a good time that she has no need to look elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Mars is in your Fourth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Angelina may be particularly energetic at home, or you could see her as the one 
who directs activities in that area. As long as the two of you are working 
together, you probably won’t resent being directed, but if your partner bosses 
you around and/or doesn’t help with the chores that you’re being ordered to do, 
you could view her as a dictator and become angry. You might thrive on such 
arguments, but if you don’t, the key to righting the situation hinges on both of 
you keeping busy at home. There will be less inclination to fight, and your 
house will be in better condition because of the work you’ve each done.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Jupiter is in your Fourth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Angelina may either make your home environment more enjoyable and cheer you up 
while you’re there, or be extravagant and prone to excesses in household 
matters. Or you may experience both sides. For example, she might decide to 
throw a party, but feel that in order for it to be successful, it must be 
lavish. You both have a wonderful time and your guests talk about it for months, 
but you also spend months paying for it. If you’re rich, no problem, but if you 
aren’t, you might have to consider if the pleasure was worth the expenditure. 
One compromise might be to entertain lavishly only occasionally, and not have a 
second party before you’ve paid for the first.</span></p>

Angelina’s Saturn is in your Eighth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Angelina may either seem a bit sexually inhibited herself, or make you feel that 
way. Another possibility is that you feel that your sex life could use more 
excitement and innovation. However, this placement can also mean serious 
commitment, so that you can probably count on your partner to be faithful. 
Although your sexual routine may sometimes seem boring, predictability and habit 
can lead to security, and a feeling of security often improves one’s sex life. 
As you both feel more secure, your sex life can become a gratifying 
manifestation of the strong bond between you. </span></p>

Angelina’s Uranus is in your Eleventh House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Even though she may not be a joiner or one who enjoys large gatherings, when you 
do appear together in groups Angelina will probably stand out from the crowd. At 
times she may be enthusiastic about going, and may have a wonderful time. There 
may be other times when she refuses to go to meetings or parties, or, when once 
there, she suddenly decides to leave. If you’re unnerved by the uncertainty of 
her response to invitations, or you feel isolated from others because she won’t 
socialize at all, there are ways to get cooperation. One possibility is to tempt 
her with the prospect of intellectually stimulating company. Another is to find 
a group that advocates a humanitarian cause to which she can relate. If it 
involves revolutionary activity, she may willingly become active in the group, 
and you’ll have more of a social life together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">
Angelina’s Neptune is in your Twelfth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Angelina could subtly bring out your mystical qualities, and/or you may have a 
telepathic communication with each other. She could have the ability to tap into 
your subconscious, so that your thoughts need not be spoken. This, of course, 
could create a strong bond between you. But in any case where your subconscious 
mind is being probed, you should be aware that it’s only a short step from 
reading your mind to planting ideas there. So be sensitive to the possibility of 
being manipulated, as well as of doing some manipulation yourself. </span></p>

Angelina’s Pluto is in your Tenth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
If you and Angelina share a career, power struggles might be an issue that you 
have to deal with. You might feel that she’s always bossing you around and 
trying to take total charge. If you’re given the freedom to be totally in charge 
of whatever <i>you</i> contribute, you may not mind this. If, however, you 
resent her attitude, think about what you’d like to be in charge of, and set up 
a meeting. At that time, thoroughly analyze which areas you each want to 
control. Both of you may then get what you want without a struggle. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Even 
if you don’t share a career, your partner may still try to tell you what to do 
and when to do it. But in this case, you won’t have to make such diligent 
efforts to share the power. You can merely smile, say thank you, go to work, and 
do as you please.</span></p>

<b><span style="font-size:22.0pt;color:black"><br>
For Angelina: Your Style of Relating</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
To figure out your own personal relationship needs, we’re first going to look at 
your basic personality type with both its strengths and its weak points. This 
can show what you have to contribute, and what you need from someone else. The 
better you know your own nature, the more successful you’ll be in your 
relationships. You can more easily make allowances for your own blind spots, and 
you can more consciously select a partner who will bring you happiness. </span>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
You have few or no planets in Earth signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
An overall lack of the Earth element in your horoscope suggests that you are 
either impractical or not very interested in the material world. Thus you may be 
bored by down-to-earth details, or not able to handle them. In either case, it’s 
helpful to have someone who can take care of the details for you. A partner who 
is too earthbound could be tiresome, but you, with your lack of Earth, may be 
able to add a spark of inspiration. Anyway, try to be grateful for your 
partner’s diligence, which allows you to feel less burdened.</span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
You have many planets in Cardinal signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your chart’s emphasis on the Cardinal signs indicates that you tend to jump in 
and get involved, and that you usually don’t wait for others to initiate things. 
You may sometimes think that you’d like a quieter life, but if there’s too much 
peace and quiet, it’s in your nature to stir things up. </span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
You have few planets in Fixed signs or houses.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You may not always follow through to the bitter end, and you could be accused of 
being undirected. If you look too far ahead, you could feel so overwhelmed that 
you either stop what you’re doing or never begin. One way to ensure completion 
is to concentrate on the task at hand. It’s also good to have a partner who will 
help you to focus and to finish what you start. </span></p>

Your Sun in Gemini reinforces the idea that you’re pretty versatile. Most 
likely, you can easily do more than one thing at a time. In fact, you might find 
it hard to concentrate on any one thing for very long. Needing variety, you may 
not take the time to probe deeply into your interest of the moment. Fortunately, 
you’re a quick study and can form an accurate overview of a subject almost 
instantly. You may not understand the subject in depth, but you’ll know enough 
for your own purposes. Your motto might be, “If you can’t learn it fast, it 
probably isn’t worth knowing.” </span></p>

<span style="color:black">This talent can be extended to people. You’re 
basically sociable, and can determine the essence of an individual or a group 
almost instantaneously and fit in right away, if you so choose. This skill can 
be useful. Even if you find yourself with people who are trained in a technical 
field you know nothing about, you quickly pick up the group’s jargon and can 
seem as knowledgeable as they are. The secret of your success is that you leave 
the room before you exhaust your newly-learned vocabulary. This suits you, 
because you would probably become bored if you hung around for too long. </span>

<span style="color:black">In terms of a partner, you’d do well with someone 
who’s also sociable, and you’d probably like a good sense of humor, too. Then 
you can rest assured that you can interact as a couple without concern about the 
impression you make. You will also not have to worry about being saddled all 
evening with your partner. You can each flit around the gathering on your own 
and have stories to share when you return home. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">With little patience for slow-thinking people, you’d 
also want a partner who’s mentally agile. Not necessarily a mental giant, just 
someone who can carry on a light, pleasant conversation and follow the gist of 
what you have to say. This may not be as easy as it sounds, because you may tend 
to jump from subject to subject and even occasionally omit words. While you may 
not like being interrupted by questions, it’s OK for your partner to add an 
occasional word or expand upon an idea you’ve expressed. That can be considered 
brainstorming, and you welcome such contributions. You have little desire, 
however, for lengthy and profound intellectual conversations. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">The fact that you enjoy social interaction and like to 
keep your conversations light doesn’t mean that your entire life has to be 
superficial. You simply need to include these sorts of diversions for release 
and relief, and to contribute to the diversity that is your essence.</span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your Moon is in Aries.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The way you express your feelings is usually direct, honest and simple. You can 
tell others how you feel about them, and your sincere manner of displaying your 
feelings lets the world know that they are genuine. You find it easy to explain 
your reasons, because they’re usually formulated without deep and weighty 
analysis. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Since you ordinarily don’t analyze your emotions 
deeply, they may sometimes spontaneously erupt. Basically, you react to the 
behavior of others. If people are nice to you, you like them. If they aren’t, 
you don’t, and it’s usually the most recent encounter that determines the way 
you feel. This may make you seem inconsistent, and your behavior may be 
difficult for a partner to understand. Once your mode of operating is 
understood, however, your partner can not only grasp the meaning of your moods 
but also learn to deal with them. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">One of the positive sides of your Moon is that you 
don’t mind if your partner understands your feelings. You aren’t concerned with 
dark secrets being unearthed, because there probably are none. However, your 
emotional simplicity can also be a point of vulnerability. Anyone who wants to 
hurt you can do so easily by pointing out your faults. Your immediate reaction 
may be to lash out in anger. The anger will probably be gone as soon as you 
express it. You don’t harbor grudges for long, nor do you look for the hidden 
meanings in people’s actions. However, the impact on your feelings of self-worth 
may be long-lasting. You may not show it, but the wound will still be there.

<span style="color:black">While you may keep your hurt feelings to yourself, 
it’s more likely that you’ll simply return each insult that’s thrown at you. 
This can make for a tumultuous relationship. This in itself may not be bad, 
because you may like to express your feelings and you may need stimulation to do 
this. Nevertheless, if your self-esteem is attacked, the damage that occurs may 
far outweigh the excitement. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">If you often have hurt feelings in your relationship, 
discuss this with your partner. Because your feelings are clear and simple, it 
should be easy to convey them. If your partner can do the same, you can begin to 
make changes quickly. If probing is necessary, you may not have the attention 
span for long conversations, so have short ones often until you can determine 
what should be done. And while you’re doing this, try, try to be more patient.</span></p>

<b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><br>
Your Axis of Relationship</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
And now we get to your “axis of relationship” -- your Ascendant (or rising sign) 
and, directly opposite it, your Descendant. Together, these say a great deal 
about how you relate. While your Ascendant describes the way you present 
yourself to others, the Descendant tells the other side of the story. It 
suggests the sort of partner you’ll be drawn to and who will make you feel more 
complete. <br>
If the birth time for your chart is accurate, you have the sign Cancer rising. 
This means that while you’re deep-feeling, sensitive, and may easily be hurt, 
you tend to hide this from the outer world by retreating behind the safety of a 
tougher facade. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Indeed, when relating to others, you feel more secure 
and confident if you have a home base or some other protected place into which 
you can retreat from time to time. Therefore, having, or yourself creating, a 
secure and comfortable haven is essential for you to function in the world and 
relate to others. This desire for shelter and security could come out as a 
strong inclination to own a home or a piece of land, or to cling to one that you 
already have, particularly if it came from your family. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Not only does having a secure home space give you a 
feeling of safety, it also figures in the way you present yourself to others. 
While you yourself probably very much enjoy being in a comfortable, “homey” 
environment, you may also create this in order to draw others to you. For you, a 
home is, like your face and manner, part of your personal equipment for 
interfacing with others. This means that you tend to surround yourself with a 
welcoming atmosphere, not necessarily a grand or chic one, but simply a place 
where people can relax and feel nurtured and taken care of. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Indeed, nurturing is the other thing that 
characterizes your approach to others. No matter what your sex is, there’s 
something motherly in the way you deal with the world. Your nurturing could take 
the form of words of wisdom or an affectionate pat or a strong desire to have 
and rear progeny, but it could also come out as an urge to care for animals or 
to help plants to grow. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">One of the most common ways people nurture, however, 
is through food. You probably like to cook, or at least take some sort of 
special interest in the preparation and taste of food. Also, when you want to 
give someone something, food may be the present that usually comes into your 
mind. (It was probably a Cancer rising person who first thought up the idea that 
the way to a person’s heart is through his stomach!) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">You’re so prone to equating food with affection and 
emotional support that not only do you show your love by encouraging others to 
eat, you also may tend to overeat when you yourself are feeling hurt or unloved. 
For you, food is a way of bestowing love upon yourself as well as others. Your 
partner should watch for this tendency, and if you start to eat too much or too 
often, this would be a good time to give you some extra hugs. When you feel 
cared for, you’ll probably be less inclined to overeat. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">While food and shelter are the tangible ways through 
which you provide security, what you’re essentially built to give others is 
emotional security and a sense of rootedness in family and tradition. In 
contrast, the partner who completes you would tend to provide material security 
-- not only a financial base, but a secure relationship to society and the 
outside world. Your partner might also take care of many practical outer-world 
responsibilities, and offer some rules and structure to complement your 
emotional warmth and your tendency to be lenient and always forgiving of human 
foibles. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Still, you’ll probably shoulder many responsibilities 
around the home, and one of the ways you do your share might be by economizing 
on what you buy. Cancerians are sometimes great savers. You may consider it your 
responsibility to hang on to items that you can re-use, or be inclined to store 
up food and other things in case some day there’s a shortage. This is part of 
your Cancerian approach to life. Being surrounded by accumulations of almost any 
kind can add to the protective shell around you and make you feel safer. While 
it can be useful up to a point, with some people this tendency to save goes 
beyond practicality. As with overeating, a tendency to over-accumulate can come 
from a feeling of being insecure and unloved, and help could come in the form of 
an extra measure of affection and protection from your mate. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">In your urge to nurture and mother other people, you 
run the danger of doing too much for them, with the result that they become 
dependent on you. For example, the more you do, the more responsibilities a 
partner may leave to you. To avoid this, you need clearly to define the duties 
that each of you is supposed to perform. You may share certain duties, but 
establish the shared ones formally as well. Make these decisions together. It 
shouldn’t be difficult, because a partner of yours is likely to naturally take 
to having some structure in the relationship. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Because of your strong attachment to the home, you may 
have a hard time leaving it. This could present a problem if your partner likes 
to travel. When traveling, you may feel better if, besides the necessities, you 
bring some of your dearest possessions and place them around the room you’ll be 
sleeping in. This can help you to feel at home wherever you may be.</span></p>

Dating and Romance </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>

<span style="color:black">We’ll start where relationships begin -- in the house 
of courtship, love affairs and romance. This is the Fifth House, which, 
interestingly, is also associated with risk-taking. Not surprising when you 
consider that romance is often where you have to take the plunge and throw 
yourself open to chance! Will Mr./Ms. Right cross your path at the mixer dance 
or singles bar? Will you gather your courage to ask someone out on a date? Will 
that blind date be a delight or a disaster? This is just part of the reason that 
the Fifth is the place where love relationships begin. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Once you’ve started to date, the Fifth House’s 
recreational side emerges. Fifth-House activities like dinner out, plays and 
movies, museums and sports provide a pleasurable atmosphere to encourage a 
budding acquaintance to flower into something more. Sometimes called the house 
of self-expression, the Fifth also rules self-display, as you each put on your 
finest feathers to attract the other. Dating in the Fifth leads to marriage in 
the Seventh House and sex in the Eighth, and then the cycle begins again with 
children, which are also shown by the Fifth House and its association with 
self-expression and play. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">There are a number of different signs and planets 
associated with your relationship houses, and each of these contributes its own 
symbolic themes to that area of your life. The more that you both try to express 
the various qualities that are symbolized in these key relationship areas of 
your charts, the happier and more complete your relationship is likely to feel.

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Scorpio is on your Fifth-House cusp.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your romantic relationships are neither frivolous nor superficial. In fact, when 
you think of romance, it is most likely in terms of a grand passion. Even from 
the outset, you want to connect on a deeply emotional level. To you, a 
satisfying romance means sharing your innermost feelings, either verbally or 
otherwise. If you find this difficult to do, your romantic life suffers. Sex may 
provide such an emotional connection, but it must be deeply involving. Sex that 
is merely recreational won’t do. It’s also possible that you’ll achieve this 
deep rapport with your beloved by going through dramatic life experiences 
together. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">You tend to make a heavy emotional investment in an 
area that is meant to be a playful try-out for the real thing. Some kinds of 
partner may take your relationship more lightly than you do. You may find 
yourself analyzing the other’s deepest motives, and becoming possessive or maybe 
even obsessive about your romantic connection. The more secure you feel in the 
relationship, however, the less likely you’re to hold on so tightly. You may be 
able to live this house on a less emotionally demanding level by delving into 
some subject deeply together, or making a game of pooling some of your financial 
or other resources. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Sagittarius is within the Fifth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
After you have begun to feel sufficiently secure in a romance (or have become 
exhausted by its emotional intensity) you’ll probably relax your grip and begin 
to lighten up. Heavy emotional encounters may give way to learning things 
together, or to planning a big trip. Or, if your romantic partner wanted a bit 
more freedom, now you become more inclined to give it, because you yourself may 
be a bit restless and in search of more fun or intellectual stimulation in the 
world at large. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Capricorn is within the Fifth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The casual, pal-type relationship will eventually take on a more sober and 
practical cast. Going beyond just having good times together, you’ll evaluate 
your romantic partner very practically, considering his or her position in the 
world, what he or she has to give you, and whether the connection is in general 
worth while. If your partner passes your scrutiny and makes a commitment to you, 
in return you’ll be responsible and will steadfastly fulfill your obligations.</span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Mars, the ruler of your Fifth House, is in the Ninth</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The planet that’s traditionally associated with the sign on the Fifth-House cusp 
brings in additional considerations. Placed in the Ninth House, it means that 
you want a romantic involvement that will help you to grow and develop. You 
might feel that you need more than one person to satisfy these needs. In fact, 
you might become bored if you stay with one individual for too long. So you

critical and get disenchanted with the relationship. It’s good to remind 
yourself that there’s no such thing as a perfect relationship. If they’re not 
too numerous, try to accept the imperfections, and focus on the lovelier things 
that you have together. If, however, the romantic haze lifts only to reveal that 
the assets are few, you might want to consider changing or dissolving the 
relationship and endeavor to start over with a more realistic approach. </span>

Becoming Partners</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Through the pleasures, risk-taking and self-expression signified by the Fifth

<span style="color:black">Traditionally the house of marriage, Seventh House 
signifies the way you make a serious commitment to another, and the way that 
your commitment is recognized in the social sphere beyond your relationship. 
Even when your relationship doesn’t result in marriage, this is the house where 
you learn to blend your individualities without submerging them, and, for better 
or for worse, to deal as a team with the ups and downs of life. It’s also the 
place of head-to-head confrontations, where you encounter both your similarities 
and your differences, and you each negotiate your fair share in disputes. </span>

Capricorn is on your Seventh-House cusp.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You want a partner who is reliable and possibly already established in the 
world. Therefore, that person could be older than you. Or <i>you</i> might play 
the responsible role in the relationship, which could mean that you’re drawn to 
a partner who is younger and/or needs to be taken care of. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">It is not absolutely necessary, however, that there be 
an age differential in your partnership. The matter of responsibility is more 
important. Probably what you really need is a partner who will share in the 
responsibility and the commitment. This is because if either of you tries to do 
it all alone, the responsible partner could feel burdened, and the irresponsible 
one could feel restricted. It’s more likely that you’d both be happier if you 
shouldered the responsibility together.</span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Aquarius is within the Seventh House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Besides responsibility, you also need a degree of freedom within your intimate 
relationships, so 24-hour-a-day togetherness is not for you. Remember that both 
of you need to have some personal space, and that you should be allowed to 
maintain your individuality within the relationship. There’s also a strong 
possibility that your partner will be from a different background than your own, 
or will be non- conforming in some other way, either in appearance or ideas. If 
you support each other’s uniqueness instead of fighting or ignoring it, and each 
allow the other some freedom, you could have a very satisfying and stimulating 
partnership. </span></p>

Saturn, the ruler of your Seventh House, is in the Twelfth</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
In your chart the planet that’s traditionally associated with the sign on your 
Seventh-House cusp is placed in the Twelfth House of confinement and secrets. 
This suggests that despite any conventional ideas you have about what marriage 
is supposed to be, you may find yourself fearing that a close, committed 
relationship might confine and restrict you. If this is so, accept that this is 
part of your makeup. If you really do want to keep a long-term relationship 
going, there are ways to give yourself the space you need. One of you can have a 
job that involves travel, or you can maintain separate residences, or you can 
agree to have an open relationship. This feeling of restriction may come from a 
fear of revealing yourself fully to your partner. Becoming comfortable with 
yourself and eventually daring to share your secrets can allow you to be more 
open and genuine with your partner and will deepen your intimacy. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Your marriage may have an element of secrecy in other 
ways: either the marriage is secret, or the two of you maintain your own secret 
world together. You may like to fantasize together, or by yourself you may 
fantasize what you’d like marriage to be. Some couples with this placement both 
deepen and uplift their relationship by teaming up to help others.</span></p>

Every planet that a person has in the Seventh House would indicate at least one 
additional requirement for them in a close one-to-one relationship. You have no 
planets here, however. For you, close partnerships may not be the all-consuming 
concern that they might be to someone who has a full Seventh House. This means 
that you could actually have an easier time finding a marriage partner. Your 
requirements in a partner are apt to be looser, and so you can be open to a 
greater variety of people. </span></p>

Entwining Souls</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Joined into a single entity in the Seventh House, you become ready to transform 
each other in the Eighth. To do this, you need to relax your grip on whatever 
you felt necessary to maintain yourselves as separate individuals. Then you need 
to take a leap of faith, and trust that the essentially benevolent forces of 
life will pull you through. If you emerge from this trial successfully, you will 
be transformed and renewed. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">This, of course, is the essence of sex, which is one 
of the areas that the Eighth House stands for. The Eighth also depicts the other 
sorts of deep emotional bonds that arise in relationships, as you shed the 
shells of your individuality to merge into a larger whole. On a material level, 
the Eighth depicts the merging of property and finances, where you each need to 
give up what is yours and contribute it to the common pool. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">With the high emotional intensity of the Eighth House 
and its lack of objectivity, power struggles are possible. Any impulse to do 
harm must always be contained. The key lies in developing compassion for your 
own emotional state, in letting go of tightly held positions, and then inviting 
powers out of your conscious control to lead you in the right direction. </span>

Aquarius is on your Eighth-House cusp.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
To you, sex can mean expressing your individuality. You may feel free and 
uninhibited in sex, or you could declare your independence by assuring yourself 
that you’re no one’s sex object. You want to be the partner who determines when 
and where sex happens. You could also combine the two possibilities, feeling 
liberated and unrestrained in sex, but only when you yourself are in the mood 
for it.</span></p>

You are probably also looking for the perfect physical union. This is hard to 
find, so you may sometimes fantasize about sex and your partner. Using your 
imagination can enhance your sex life, but don’t carry this to the point where 
you delude yourself. Also beware of being the partner who does all the giving. 
Emotional experiences need to be shared with someone who cares. Pick a sex 
partner who returns your deep feelings, and you won’t have to play “let’s 
pretend.”</span></p>

Saturn, the ruler of your Eighth House, is in the Twelfth</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The placement of your Eighth-House ruler in the Twelfth House suggests that you 
may need a certain degree of fantasy in your sex life. You could yearn for the 
kind of sex described in novels, and if the actual circumstances fall short of 
your expectations, you might find yourself involved in a clandestine 
relationship. A secret sexual relationship can be exciting, but it can certainly 
complicate the rest of your life. Before going this route, try rekindling the 
flame of the partnership that drove you in that direction. To get a different 
perspective on your sexual relationship, you could go to an exotic place with 
your partner, or stay at home and try candlelight, soft music and a bit of 
fantasy to create an atmosphere conducive to romance. </span></p>

Because you have no planets in your Eighth House, your requirements for sex and 
deep emotional bonding are simpler than they might be. If one or more of your 
partner’s planets falls into your Eighth, however, it can add some different 
themes as well as additional energy to your sex life. </span></p>

How You See Brad</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
To see how you experience Brad, what he means to you personally, and the biases 
you may have when dealing with this important person in your life, we’re now 
going to look at the way his planets fit into the houses of your birth chart.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">You could think of Brad’s planets as “lighting up” 
your houses, bringing more energy to the areas of life that those houses deal 
with. His planets can activate underactive areas of your life, making you feel 
more complete. Or they may increase the activity in areas that that are already 
emphasized in your own chart. They may repeat problematic themes in your 
horoscope so that you’re finally forced to deal with them, or give you the added 
push to make the most of assets that you already have. All this influences the 
way you feel about him, and suggests the functions that he will take on in your 
life. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">First, however, before looking at specific houses and 
planets, it can be revealing just to look at the overall way Brad’s planets are 
grouped around your chart wheel.<br>
With more of Brad’s planets falling into the bottom half of your chart, you will 
probably tend to see him as introverted. To you, he may seem to keep a lot 
inside, and not be inclined to share it with you or anyone else. You may also 
see him as a non-conforming person who lives by an inner standard and is not 
particularly interested in what society thinks. Trying to influence him by 
pointing to what others believe is right or wrong may not work. Whether or not 
Brad is really as introverted as you think, you may be more successful if you 
appeal to his integrity and inner ethical sense rather than to externally 
imposed standards. <br>
The fact that more of Brad’s planets fall into the right-hand half of your chart 
suggests that you tend to view him primarily as a responder. You may not expect 
him to take the initiative, and you could see him as slow or indecisive when 
initiative and decisiveness are necessary. You might think that if you left 
taking action to him, you’d never do anything as a couple. You might therefore 
do things like accept invitations or set your social calendar without consulting 
with this partner. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">If neither of you minds this, fine. But, if your 
partner resents not having a say in what’s happening, chances are that his own 
chart indicates that he’s basically an initiator. You don’t have to give up the 
reins entirely, but you might discuss the matter and together determine areas 
where your partner can be in charge. You might even enjoy not having to make all 
the decisions.</span></p>

<b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><br>
How Brad Affects Specific Areas of Your Life</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
And now for particular planets in particular houses. Pay special attention to 
the houses that contain Brad’s Sun and Moon, because these are likely to 
represent focal areas in your relationship with him. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Brad’s Sun is in your Fifth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
If you have children together, you might see Brad as being warm and generous 
with them and possibly taking pride in what they do. However, if he feels 
unappreciated, what you may see is someone who’s bossy and overbearing. If this 
is the case, try a little romance or stroking. Then you may see his warm and 
generous side in regard to the kids. Since the Fifth House is also the area of 
creativity, you may see Brad as very creative, whether or not the issue of 
children is relevant. If you think that he overshadows you in terms of 
creativity, you may feel that you lack talent and never try to do anything 
creative. If this is true, try some artistic endeavor together. If you cooperate 
with each other, Brad’s ability may stimulate you to view yourself as being 
creative. </span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Brad’s Moon is in your Sixth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You may feel appreciated because Brad is emotionally supportive and 
understanding of all the work you do. On the other hand, when you try to work 
together, emotions might run high or be inconsistent. For example, your emotions 
could be triggered by a difference of opinion on how to do a certain task. You 
may think that it’s Brad who’s having the outburst or is pushing your emotional 
buttons, but he may be just as convinced that you’re the unstable one. To avoid 
such problems, you could work separately instead of together, either doing 
different tasks, or the same tasks at different times. Then, instead of the 
flack, you might get the support and appreciation that this placement promises.</span></p>

Brad’s Mercury is in your Sixth House.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You and Brad may be talk a lot about how you handle your daily routine. This 
could take the form of his simply being interested in what you do. Or he might 
take a more active role and either tell you what you should be doing or help you 
to get more organized. Although Brad might have a great deal of advice to offer, 
however, there might be little practical assistance. If this happens often and 
you’re tired of doing all the work, you can get him to take a more active role. 
When he starts to tell you how to perform a certain task, suggest that while 
you’re being taught, he also show you how to do it. Either your daily routine 
will become easier, or your partner will stop giving you advice. Either 
alternative could be an improvement.</span></p>

Ideally, even the most tedious chores could become pleasant when you’re doing 
them with Brad. When you’re working together, you’d both be inclined to do 
things that make daily life more beautiful and harmonious. Also, you’d probably 
agree on how things should be done. If you do disagree, Brad would probably go 
along with what you wanted in order to keep the peace. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">But there’s also the possibility that, when it comes 
to tackling the nitty-gritty details of life together, Brad may play rather than 
work, and may try to tempt you to play when you should be working. If you 
experience Brad’s goof-off side, don’t nag, because that’ll only upset his 
desire for peace and harmony in this area. Negotiation and compromise will work 
far better in getting him to help. When you divide the chores, try to let him do 
the ones that create a more beautiful or pleasurable home. Your partner may 
gladly help out if there’s pleasure involved in doing the chores, plus the 
prospect of more pleasure as a reward.</span></p>

<span style="color:black">On the other hand, you might experience Brad as 
dictatorial, telling you what you should do without personally participating. 
Then, instead of accomplishing anything, you could just have arguments. It may 
help to focus on some small task that you can do together. While you’re working, 
you can discuss your differences. Expending energy as you talk can keep you from

You may see Brad as a philosopher, or at least as someone who has ideas about 
philosophy, religion, travel, higher education or politics. he’s probably never 
at a loss for words on these topics, and you may well find that he broadens your 
perspective. On the other hand, you could feel overwhelmed by all this 
eloquence, or overruled if your views differ. Brad’s having philosophical ideas 
and expressing them well doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re absolutes for 
everyone. You’re entitled to your own opinion. If you can manage to squeeze your 
own thoughts into your conversations together, you might discover that he’s 
actually open to at least some of your ideas.</span></p>

Brad brings seriousness and dependability to your relationship, and is likely to 
be always there for you -- whether you want it or not. This can feel reassuring, 
but also restrictive. If you feel as if Big Brother is always watching, try 
asking your partner to take on more commitments. Make sure that these 
responsibilities will be beneficial for the relationship, but that they don’t 
include your participation. You’ll get more breathing room, and your partner 
will probably enjoy taking charge.</span></p>

You may see Brad as having rather unusual ideas about how you should spend your 
money. These ideas may be creative and worth exploring, or simply bizarre. If 
they’re bizarre, say “That sounds interesting,” and forget about it. Another 
possibility is that Brad makes you more spontaneous in financial matters. This 
would be particularly noticeable if you’re ordinarily a conservative spender. 
You might be encouraged to buy unusual things, or ones that make you feel more 
independent. Just avoid getting carried away and spending too much, and if you 
go shopping with him, maybe you should leave your credit cards at home.</span></p>

Brad could either bring confusion to your home environment, or help to make it a 
sanctuary, or do both. Whatever happens, one thing is clear: Your partner 
probably won’t operate well under rules and regulations in the home. Instead of 
being defiant or consciously trying to break the rules, he may just seem to lack 
awareness that they exist. Your partner’s talent in the home is in helping to 
create a haven where you can escape. So instead of fighting the chaos that may 
sometimes occur, join in the fantasy as often as you can, and you’ll both be 
happier. </span></p>

You may feel that Brad wants control over your money. Even if you don’t allow 
this to happen officially, you may find him advising you on how you should 
handle your finances. You may promise yourself that you won’t be ruled on money 
matters, but may anyway find yourself following his orders anyway. And this may 
work both ways, with your partner having a similar experience of you. Instead of 
feeling weak and ineffectual because your power is usurped, remind yourself that 
you each have the right to do what you wish with the money you’ve each earned or 
the money that’s been allotted to you. Perhaps it’s time to make an 
understanding that each of you has control over a certain part of your joint 
finances. In this way you can each feel in control of some area, and you’ll both 
feel more secure and powerful.</span></p>

<b><span style="font-size:22.0pt;color:black">The Dynamics between the Two of 
You</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Now we’re ready to look at some typical kinds of dramas that can play out 
between you. These are suggested by the way the planets in one person’s chart 
relate to those in the other. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">The different planets in your chart are like little 
characters who are interacting with each other inside your psyche. They also 
interact with the little characters inside other people. For example, Mars, the 
little warrior inside you, could be having a hot and heavy affair with your 
partner’s sultry, come-hither Venus. This could take the form either of cozying 
up in bed together, or fighting most of the time. Or these two little characters 
could be constantly on each other’s mind, but somehow at cross-purposes or never 
quite on each other’s wavelength. The basic quality of each planet, plus the 
aspect, or kind of angle, that is formed between them, determines how well those 
parts of the psyche will get along with each other, and what the nature of their 
alliance or conflict will be. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Below, the aspects between your charts are arranged 
roughly in order of how important they’ll be to you personally. Take special 
note whenever you see aspects involving the same pairs of planets next to each 
other in the list. If you see, for example, not only your Venus conjunct your 
partner’s Mars, but also your partner’s Mars making an aspect to your Venus, you 
can be sure that Venus-Mars themes such as sex, or some other sort of very 
creative, productive activity, will be of overriding importance in your life 
together. </span></p>

Meshing Your Personalities and Goals</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Aspects involving your Ascendant or Midheaven depend not only on the day you 
were born, but also on the exact time. They therefore make you different from 
most others born on the same day, and have a particularly personal significance.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">The Ascendant is the place where a planet would rise 
from the inner realm below the horizon to the outer world above. As such, it 
symbolizes the interface between the inner you and the outside world. This is 
your personality -- the face you put on, your body and manner, your habitual way 
of dealing with others. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">The Midheaven is the highest point a planet can go in 
your chart. As you might expect, it signifies the most universally visible part 
of you -- your career goals, your most public self and your reputation. Aspects 
involving the Midheaven of one or both partners can therefore be among the most 
powerful indicators of how one partner relates to the other’s reputation, career 
and overall life direction. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Because the Ascendant and Midheaven move so fast (on 
average, a whole degree in only four minutes of time) their correct positions 
depend on whether you know your birth time accurately. Aspects between these 
points and your partner’s horoscope can say very important things about your 
relationship. If you’re unsure of your birth time, however, it’s best to take 
any interpretations of aspects from your Ascendant and Midheaven with a grain of 
salt. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">To deal with these problems, you each need to find a 
way to take care of your own personal needs while balancing them with the needs

health or relations with others. </span></p>

You find each other attractive, and it’s clear to both you and others that you 
enjoy being together. But what Brad needs in terms of love, affection and 
pleasure may be quite different from what Angelina wants. If you try to combine 
what you each need personally, you could keep pressing so hard for the other to 
satisfy your desires that you both tend to overdo things. Instead of pressuring 
your partner, try expressing your affection in a way that’s natural to you, but 
also allow the other person to set some boundaries. When it’s appropriate, Brad 
can showhis approval of Angelina’s looks and manner without attempting to change 
her image. No matter what you do, your attraction will probably be there, but 
when you let each other be yourselves without undue pressure, you’ll both be 
happier. </span></p>

This combination carries the possibility of being a powerful and effective 
couple, but in fact you may more often challenge each other than cooperate. 
Feeling that Brad is trying to control and direct her, Angelina could develop 
low self-esteem, because she thinks that her partner is showing disapproval. And 
if Brad senses that Angelina is trying to undermine his power, he could start to 
feel ineffectual. If either of these situations describes what’s happening in 
your relationship, determine what’s wrong and change it. Find ways to cooperate, 
and you’ll feel stronger both individually and as a couple.</span></p>

project as a couple. It is fitting that Angelina should pursue personal 
gratification, while Brad should project a personal image that is in keeping 
with his individual personality. However, all of this should be done within the 
framework of the partnership. It really is possible for each of you to balance 
or guide the other without interfering with your own personal goals. If you can 
each work in your own direction and at the same time keep the good of the

behavior can be disturbing. Instead of dwelling on the inconsistency, 
concentrate on finding new things to do together or new ventures or causes in

There’s a stressful, dynamic interaction between Brad’s emotions and Angelina’s 
career or public image, so that when feelings and career come up, there could be 
friction between you. Brad might view Angelina as a workaholic and feel 
personally neglected, and Angelina could feel professionally undermined by an 
overly emotional partner. At these times if Brad gives Angelina a bit of extra 
nurturing, and Angelina publicly announces her appreciation of Brad’s emotional 
support, you might be surprised at just how comforting this combination can be.

Brad’s pleasure, love and affection are connected with Angelina’s career and/or

self-indulgently seek pleasure in a way that could harm Angelina’s career, or 
Angelina could be so focused on career that Brad feels neglected. Showing each

No matter how you personally project yourself, when you and your partner are 
interacting with the outer world you’ll be noticed. You have choices as to how 
you might be seen. You could be looked upon as philosophical or fun to be with, 
or you may be seen as loud, extravagant, and prone to excess. You can choose

Angelina’s career or public image blends quite well with Brad’s concept of life

material terms. In addition, you want to help each other to attain tangible 
success. Brad may organize and take care of details so that Angelina can move 
ahead professionally, and Angelina can use her public image or career to provide 
the material security that Brad is seeking. Because you believe that you have to 
work hard to get what you want, you may not take the easiest route to attain

you may not advance quickly, your persistence will allow you to move steadily

expresses individuality or creativity, Brad could throw the full force of his 
career or public image behind Angelina’s efforts. When Brad concentrates on 
career or public image, Angelina could then forget about personal freedom and 
instead add originality and creativity to Brad’s efforts. It this way, you’ll 
each have your personal needs met, and you’ll have grown as a couple because 
you’ve supported each other. </span></p>

Brad wants to be seen and Angelina wants to be heard, and so you run the risk of

invisible, because everyone is listening to Angelina. Angelina may believe that 
her voice is falling on deaf ears, because everyone is watching Brad. This does 
not mean you should never appear in public together. Instead, you should respect 
each other and take turns being on stage. If either of you feels slighted, 
discuss the matter and make an arrangement whereby each of you can alternate 
being the center of attention while the other stays in the background. There’s 
no reason why you can’t both have your egos gratified.</span></p>

caught up in helping your partner that you don’t consider the cost of your 
ventures in terms of cash and energy. If you find yourselves physically or

you should each be there to balance the behavior of the other. It could be that 
one of you tends to be demonstrative, and the other more intellectual. So 
discussion might help keep the feelings of one partner in control, and the 
modified demonstrative behavior might make the intellectual partner warmer. 
Another possibility in regard to feelings and affection could be described as 
practicality versus emotionality. In this case, the practical partner can keep 
the emotional partner from getting carried away, and the emotional partner can 
help the practical partner to show feelings a little more openly. So if you’re 
each there as a backdrop for the other rather than trying to totally change your

relationship, both emotions and practicality need to be given their due. To 
accomplish this, Angelina could provide material security and set broad 
parameters for Brad’s emotional expression. And Brad could give emotional

of you, anger <i>could</i> be a stimulating prelude to lovemaking. But if it 
gets in the way of your sex life, it’s time to start looking for new ways to 
show the attraction you feel. Work on making love, not war, and the enjoyment 
you feel will make the effort seem worth while. The confrontations may not 
totally cease, but as you experience the more positive side of this combination, 
the spats may either become more fun or happen less often.</span></p>

You and your partner should have no difficulty sharing your emotions, and it’s 
wonderful to be able to express your feelings openly. While this combination 
indicates that emotions flow easily between you, however, these emotions may not 
always be favorable for your relationship. Anger could flow as easily as love, 
and so after you’ve emoted you could sometimes regret your behavior. Or you 
could embarrass others by being too demonstrative in public. Since this 
combination doesn’t make for a lot of control, it may be simpler to find an 
acceptable outlet for your joint feelings. One possibility is that you and your 
partner get involved in a venture in which your emotional expression is 
acceptable or even useful. You’ll still have enough emotion left over to share 
the great love you have for each other in private.</span></p>

“Power” and “emotion” are excellent words to describe this combination. But 
powerful emotions can materialize either as passion or as a weapon used against 
each other. If you try to force your attitude on your partner either subtly or 
overtly, you may evoke the weapon more often than the passion. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Instead, take turns allowing each other’s needs to be 
in the foreground. Instead of trying to manipulate Brad’s direction, Angelina 
should provide emotional support for his desire to be empowered. On his part, 
Brad can encourage his partner’s expression of feelings without interference or 
attempts to control. If you each adjust periodically to the other’s needs 
without thinking of your own, you’ll both ultimately achieve what you want. 
You’ll feel supported by your partner, and your passion will start to flow more 
freely.</span></p>

There may be friction between Angelina and the people that Brad brings into the 
relationship. Brad may be thrown into a quandary when Angelina complains about 
Brad’s friends or they complain about her. To lessen the resulting tensions 
between you, you could decide just to tolerate the situation and instead focus 
on the other facets of your partnership that are more important. Or you could 
face the problem directly and work out a joint solution. Another solution would 
be to find other people with whom you can socialize, and perhaps let Angelina 
select them.</span></p>

Keeping Communications Open</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The planet Mercury has a key importance in your relationship because it 
signifies your own style of thinking and perceiving, and also the way you convey 
your thoughts and feelings to each other. When the two of you have good Mercury 
connections, you’re able to communicate easily, and your chances of ironing out 
any differences between you are greatly increased.</span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>

You and your partner can stimulate each other to talk (Mercury) and to take 
action (Mars). But this stimulation may often materialize as anger instead of 
cooperation. Venting anger can sometimes be better than holding it in, but if 
you do little more than antagonize each other, you might want to try a new 
approach. Find a physical task that needs to be done, and set about 
accomplishing it together. As you’re working, discuss your complaints. In this 
way you’ll be using your energy effectively. And when you’re expending physical 
energy, there will be less energy available to annoy each other. You may then 
find it easier to get your points across to each other. </span></p>

The two of you have the ability to broaden each other intellectually. However, 
with this aspect you may discover that when you’re talking to each other, 
instead of listening in order to gather information, you more often compete to 
be heard. You might also find that when you’re socializing as a couple, you tend 
to exaggerate. This could be entertaining, but others might question your 
veracity. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">The good thing about this aspect is that Angelina can 
add depth to Brad’s communication skills, and Brad can help to make Angelina’s

minds, you’ll also make a better impression on society.</span></p>

When the two of you have discussions together, you may each feel that you are 
clear and honest, or you could instead feel limited and inhibited. A feeling of 
restriction might arise if Brad advises Angelina too strongly about discipline 
and structure. It could also arise if Angelina tries too hard to organize Brad’s 
manner of communicating, Things will work better if Angelina organizes the 
environment, and Brad is free to ask questions or explain Angelina’s viewpoint 
to others. It will also help if Brad is permitted to communicate in a way that’s 
comfortable for him, while Angelina stands by for reference but refrains from 
correcting or instructing. This should help your communication flow more easily, 
and a sense of honesty and security may then replace the limitations.</span></p>

Communications are an important part of your social life together, but you may 
find yourselves complaining about them more than enjoying them. The people whom 
Angelina brings to your relationship might criticize the way Brad communicates, 
or the content of his conversations. And Brad could feel uncomfortable with 
Angelina’s friends or the way that they communicate. Just complaining won’t 
solve anything, but if you openly talk about how the two of you feel, you should 
be able to work toward a solution. </span></p>

This combination can indicate that communications between you and your partner 
are creative and pleasurable. However, with this particular aspect, Brad might 
find Angelina too talkative, and Angelina might feel that Brad is self-centered 
and only wishes to discuss himself. Things will improve if you take turns doing 
the talking, while your partner listens and lends you support. For example, 
sometimes Brad could allow Angelina to talk about any subject at all, and only 
employ his tact or personal charm if the conversation starts to bore people. And 
then for a while Angelina could permit Brad to discuss himself and only 
occasionally add general information to broaden the appeal of her partner’s 
favorite topic. In this way, you’ll both satisfy your personal needs in terms of 
communications, and you’ll come across to the outer world as a very charming and 
sociable couple.</span></p>

It’s is easy for you and your partner to organize your thinking together and to 
clarify issues through discussion. But there may be times when your 
communications are inhibited because you believe you must stick strictly to the 
facts. Also, you may sometimes wish that certain matters didn’t have to be so 
clear. Nevertheless, with this combination you’ll always know where you stand 
with your partner, and your communications as a couple will have impact because 
they’re clear and direct. Though you may occasionally wish for more free-flowing 
communications, do realize that because of your interaction, you both are better 
organized and clearer thinking than either of you would be individually.</span></p>

Encouraging Affection and Pleasure</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Like a flower that attracts bees, Venus rules anything that attracts through 
beauty or pleasure, anything that engenders desire. She can also signify 
whatever you think is beautiful or valuable or attractive. In your relationship, 
Venus reveals the quality of affection that draws you together, the esteem you 
have for each other, the enjoyment that you feel, and the beauty and pleasure 
that you can create around you. </span></p>

Expressing affection is important in your relationship, but your needs and the 
way you express affection are probably quite different. If you try to force your 
way of showering love on your partner, you may feel little gratification. It 
could be that one of you actively shows feelings, while the other prefers to 
discuss love rather than be demonstrative. Or, possibly, one of you needs 
material evidence of love, while the other wants emotional support. If you try 
to make your partner conform to your needs, neither of you will feel the 
gratification that you want. Instead, try to accept your partner’s manner of 
expressing affection and balance it with your own. You may never be able to 
blend the two completely, but you can complement each other, and you’ll each 
know that the other cares.</span></p>

When it comes to love, you and your partner could feel that your contact is 
either exciting or erratic, or possibly a bit of both. Angelina may not be 
totally consistent or dependable, which could sometimes cause Brad to look for 
pleasure elsewhere. And if Brad becomes flirtatious, it might trigger Angelina’s 
unreliability. You may not be sure who is the instigator, but it doesn’t really 
matter. Instead of dwelling on the shortcomings of your partner, get involved in 
new and exciting activities together. The problems will tend to fade into the 
background when the two of you are having a really good time.</span></p>

There’s a strong, hard-to-describe love connection between you and your partner, 
and at times you may believe that you have a perfect relationship. But human 
beings are far from perfect, and you have to live in the real world. 
Periodically, the lovely illusion may dissolve, leaving you noticing the faults 
more often than the good points of your partner. If you do more criticizing than 
appreciating, remember the feeling of love that you can experience together. 
Then, every time you start to criticize, remind yourself of one of your 
partner’s strengths. As you focus on your partner’s endearing qualities, the 
favorable thoughts will begin to outnumber the critical ones, and you’ll come 
closer to the perfect union that you dream of. </span></p>

Deep and unbounded love is potentially something that you and your partner can 
share, but your expression of affection may be hindered by concern about being 
controlled. If you often think of your partner as the enemy instead of your 
devoted lover, it may be because you’re feeling manipulated. Manipulation is 
usually a covert action. Bringing your feelings out into the open will make it 
difficult for your partner to control you subtly. Besides, you might discover 
that this was not your partner’s aim at all. Once the air is cleared, you’ll be 
able to share the deep passion that is implicit in this combination. Then, 
you’ll know that it’s been worth all the effort. </span></p>

to assert yourself, go after what you want, or meet threats and defend yourself

and direct the effort. Or you may stubbornly proceed without consulting anyone. 
Or you could look to your partner for guidance, while your partner is doing the 
same thing. Instead of battling each other, one solution could be to try sharing 
a project, but each work independently on it. Anyway, if you use up your energy 
by working hard, neither of you may have enough left to argue. While you’re 
working, note how your partner operates. You could discover that there’s more 
similarity than you thought in the way that you both take action.</span></p>

Angelina might only become confused. And if Angelina tries to tell Brad how to 
complete a task, Brad could become exhausted from trying to follow her 
directions. This doesn’t mean that you should ignore each other, but it does 
mean that you should probably not try to put out equal amounts of energy at the

needed. Then you’ll each achieve your own goals, knowing that your partner has 
helped by adjusting to your needs. Whatever consideration you show each other in

With Jupiter you start to move out of your personal sphere to where you interact

institutions, religions, philosophies and ideas, or to foreign cultures. In your 
relationship, Jupiter also has much to do with the way the two of you grow,

Brad’s philosophy easily blends with Angelina’s spiritual ideas, and therefore 
you could develop an elaborate belief system together. This belief system is not 
materialistic. It is based on spirituality, so when you’re questioned about it 
you may have difficulty explaining it in practical terms. There may be those who 
think that your belief system is a sham, but this is really irrelevant because 
it’s the faith and trust that you and your partner have in each other that makes 
it work. Those who are moved by the spirit that you have together may join you, 
and those who aren’t moved won’t. As long as you and your partner have faith in 
each other, your belief system will thrive.</span></p>

your energy by waging war on each other. Instead of battling, you can use this 
combination to take charge of your lives. Brad should be allowed to express his 
ideas and philosophy, and Angelina should be permitted to use her power, with 
each of you standing by only to keep the other from going too far, too fast. If

Angelina’s Jupiter is sextile Brad’s Saturn.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
In general, you and your partner blend the principles of expansion (Jupiter) and 
contraction (Saturn) quite well. It’s true that once in a while Angelina may 
have impractical ideas about development, and Brad may try to feel more secure 
by resisting change and maintaining the status quo. But the strength of this 
aspect is that Brad can easily bring reality into the situation and keep 
Angelina within bounds. And Angelina can effortlessly assist him to expand so 
that he doesn’t stagnate. When Angelina’s wonderful ideas are brought into 
reality, it’ll benefit both of you, and you’ll continue to grow and develop as a 
couple.</span></p>

Philosophy (Jupiter) and spirituality (Neptune) are strongly connected in your 
relationship. However, if Angelina tries to force her philosophy too strongly on 
Brad, he could feel overwhelmed or believe that his spiritual needs are being 
ignored. And if Brad tries to prod Angelina into accepting his spirituality 
unconditionally, Angelina could become confused. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Things will work better if you take turns being 
active. When Angelina expresses a philosophy of life, Brad should only lend his 
spiritual support. When Brad pursues spiritual goals, Angelina should go no 
further than contributing philosophical ideas to expand his belief system. In 
this way you can ultimately create a shared philosophy of life that encompasses 
the best of both partners’ ideas.</span></p>

When you’re out socializing, particularly with those whom Brad brings to the

overextend your energies. You might enjoy their company, but if you often find 
yourselves exhausted or in debt after being with them, take another look at 
these relationships. Consider what these people do for you. If they really help 
you to broaden your horizons, the money and effort may be well spent. If they 
don’t help you to grow, however, you may want to look for others who will.</span></p>

are when these outer-planet-only aspects are either extremely exact, or the 
planets in these pairs are also being aspected by the Ascendant, Midheaven, Sun,

This combination gives the two of you the potential to blend the practical

While Angelina organizes the environment and deals with the material world, Brad 
can provide the faith and imagination (and perhaps periodic escapes) to make 
Angelina’s job easier. And Brad’s spiritual life can be enhanced when Angelina 
provides clarity or helps him to apply his spirituality to daily life. Also, 
when your life structure becomes too rigid, the two of you will know that it’s 
time to dissolve whatever isn’t functioning in your life. There might initially 
be some resistance to change, but Brad will find it natural to facilitate the 
dissolving process, and then Angelina will naturally lead in creating a new 
structure to replace the old.</span></p>

between you, but essentially you and your partner want to help each other, and 
you’ll quickly learn that there’s room for two at the top. Then Angelina can 
throw organization, clarity and determination behind Brad’s assertiveness, and 
Brad can add power to Angelina’s desire to be in a position of authority. As you 
cooperate, you’ll discover that together you can overcome virtually anything 
that stands in your path and together be seen as leaders. The sort of power that 
you generate together is especially good for revitalizing outmoded structures, 
and for creating the structures that will bring about much-needed change. </span>

them. If you consider it your duty to be their teachers or guardians, the 
relationships may not be so pleasurable, but at least they’ll have some purpose. 
Your connections with others can, however, be more satisfying. This combination 
gives the ability to view others realistically, so try to evaluate people before 
you become involved. You may still often find yourselves in charge, but, through

interfere with each other. In an attempt to avoid being controlled, Angelina 
could attack Brad and end up only feeling more restricted. Or Brad could put out 
so much energy trying to keep personal control that he just ends up feeling 
ineffectual. Instead of battling each other, it may help to turn these energies 
outward and apply them to an external cause that you can get involved in 
together. Angelina may then feel freer, and Brad more empowered.</span></p>

Pluto is an inexorable force that works slowly in the background to create what

energy that sweeps away what’s dying or outmoded so that new life can begin. In 
relationships, Pluto usually signifies power, also known as the ability to 
create change. This could be the balance of power between you, or the power that 
you as a couple exert on the outside world. Because Pluto deals with mysterious 
natural forces such as sex and death, there can be a certain smoky charisma and 
sexiness about it. </span></p>

mean that such direction is welcome. Even though Angelina may not seek such a 
role, she may be viewed as a dictator. The resentment of those who are led could 
result in power struggles, Brad might get complaints about Angelina, and you may 
then have confrontations with each other. Or, since you’re a unit, you could 
both be viewed as dictators, and Brad could become part of the complaint. You 
might avoid any of this occurring if you seek out individuals who want to be 
directed. Or you could analyze your situation together and look for other

wielding power over others, and, instead of battling each other, put that

No couple functions in isolation, and the contacts that you have with the rest

sort of Sun-Moon connection, the Nodes signify connections in general, 
particularly with other people. The North and South Nodes are always 180 degrees 
apart, so when we talk about aspects to the North Node, we’re implying aspects 
to the South Node as well.</span></p>

<span style="color:black">Remember that it’s not realistic to expect perfection 
in each other. It’s true that it may be easier to be happy and to function well 
with some partners than it would be with others. However, we tend to attract 
partners who bring with them the crises that we need to grow. When there’s an 
unresolved issue that we need to work on, the relevant partner magically 
appears. A partner’s foibles can teach us much, for they are mirrors of what we 
have within ourselves and may not otherwise be able to see. When we solve a 
problem and learn what it has to teach us, we are then permitted to move on -- 
in most cases to a more fulfilling relationship with the same person, although 
sometimes we may need to strike out on our own. Usually, it’s better to work 
with what we’re given. But either way, when we step up to any challenge with 
open eyes, we grow in wisdom and power. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">The important thing is to claim our own responsibility 
in a situation, and to refrain from hiding behind a protective wall of blame. 
When we open ourselves to the truth, we see that both we and our partner are 
human and lovably imperfect. Then our hearts become free, and we have space in 
which to expand. We’re no longer confined within our own being. When you let 
down your boundaries and merge with another, the two of you become one larger 
being with <i>more</i> than double the wisdom and humanity. <br>

To complete this relationship analysis, we’re now going to move on to the new 
entity that is formed when the two of you stay together for any length of time. 
This is not either one of you, but a new “being” that you create together, and 
which is greater than the sum of its parts. This is the relationship itself.

whether there are any particularly dominant themes. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
The Fire element is underemphasized.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
This suggests that you and your partner are probably not overtly demonstrative 
as a couple. Although you may feel inner warmth and enthusiasm, it is not easy 
for you to show it. It also may be difficult for you to be spontaneous, or to 
take the initiative. To get moving, you might need someone to light a fire under 
you. To avoid total lethargy and complaints about a lack of accomplishment, you 
might want to include stimulating people in your life. Avoid, however, those who 
have too much energy or are too forceful, as they could exhaust or overwhelm 
you. If you associate with individuals who are moderately warm and enthusiastic, 
they can give you the gentle nudge that you need.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
The Earth element is underemphasized.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
It is probable that the two of you tend not to make your decisions or plan your 
actions based on down-to-earth information. In fact, elaborate details are 
likely to bore you, and material goals do not offer an incentive to get you 
moving. You may be viewed as impractical. This has its advantages in that you 
probably are not asked to be in charge of projects that require organization and 
long-term commitment. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Though you are capable of taking care of your physical 
needs, your interests lie elsewhere. You may have to convince yourselves that 
tending to your material requirements will enrich you in other ways, or find 
someone outside of your partnership to handle these matters for you. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable energies are quite evenly balanced.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
This balance means that, as a couple, you and your partner can initiate 
(Cardinal) when it is appropriate, continue on in a particular direction 
(Fixed), or be adaptable (Mutable) if a situation warrants it. In other words, 
you have a choice of how to handle circumstances. This can be a great advantage 
when you learn to determine which approach is best for each set of conditions as 
they arise. </span></p>

Your Basic Style of Relating</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Assuming that both you and your partner have given relatively accurate birth 
times, the Ascendant of your composite chart is one of the most powerful 
indicators of the quality of your relationship. The sign on your composite 
Ascendant gives important clues about how you as a couple relate to the outside 
world, the type of people you’re drawn to, and how others perceive your 
relationship. It can also show how you relate to each other. Any planet conjunct 
or in some other close aspect to the composite Ascendant is likely to symbolize 
one of the strongest themes in your life together, at least in the location 
where you are living now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your composite Ascendant is in Libra.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Together, the two of you present an attractive, charming, and probably serene 
demeanor. Because peace and harmony have a particular appeal for you, you are 
not apt to make demands on others or be openly confrontational. Preferring 
cooperation and sharing, the two of you tend to consider the desires of your 
partner and anyone else with whom you come into contact before you think of 
yourselves. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">You each tend to understand and accept the other’s 
viewpoint, and thus you should easily be able to converse with each other. 
Together, you are able to understand the views of others, even to the point that 
you have difficulty determining your own viewpoint. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Since absolute decisions are hard for you to make, you 
find it easiest to cooperate with the decisions of others. Indeed, you seem to 
be drawn to people who enjoy making decisions and taking action. They may 
sometimes be argumentative, but they do seem to get things done. They can help 
you to overcome your own tendency to indecisiveness and inertia, and, since you 
aren’t prone to confrontations, you are not likely to get into many battles with 
them. </span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Mercury is conjunct the Descendant.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Communications are important in your relationship, and they form an integral 
part of the image that you project as a couple. With this aspect, you’re more 
likely to be noted for social skills than intellectual pursuits. Whether you’re 
talking to each other or to the outer world, your favorite topics , are probably 
people -- yourselves and the significant others in your life. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">In your discussions it’s important to maintain a 
balance between talking about yourselves and focusing on others. If you talk 
only about yourselves, you will be considered self-centered. If you talk only 
about others (or you spend more time listening than talking), you could be 
thought of as secretive, a pair that gives out very little. It’s better to 
volunteer a bit of your own information, and then solicit such information from 
others. By balancing the two, you will be thought of as open and interesting, as 
well as congenial and interested. </span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Uranus is conjunct the Ascendant.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
The two of you present a non-conforming personality to the world. You want to 
express your individuality and can be very spontaneous in so doing. You crave 
excitement, and tend to be bored when your life gets too predictable. Either or 
both of you could act strangely just to make changes or just for shock appeal. 
If your behavior gets too odd, however, people might not take you seriously. You 
don’t mind being different, but you don’t want to be treated as a joke. </span>

<span style="color:black">You can actually be very effective as a couple. You 
have the ability to get involved in a cause, start a revolution, and bring about 
meaningful changes. Because you easily get bored, might not want to stay with 
the same cause for too long, but if you join in quickly, spontaneously rebel, 
and then move on, you can contribute constructive changes and still have the 
excitement and adventure that you need. </span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
The Ascendant is square the Midheaven.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
With this combination, the personality that you and your partner share is 
connected to the public image that you project as a couple. You might sometimes 
find that you interfere with each other, or feel that your collective private 
personality does not fit into a public situation. Or one partner might behave in 
a manner that is unacceptable to the other. If such things cause problems 
between the two of you, discuss them. You may argue a bit, and it may take time, 
but you should be able to come up with some behavior that is acceptable to you 
both. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">It’s also possible that the two of you may not be well

Public vs. Private Life</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Your public image as a couple, and the reputation that the two of you have in 
the outside world, are symbolized by your composite Midheaven. Situated at the 
very top of your chart wheel, your Midheaven signifies the highest point of your 
trajectory in life -- the goals that you’re striving for together. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">At the other end of the Midheaven axis is the lowest 
point in your composite chart (known to astrologers as the Imum Coeli or I.C.). 
As you might expect, this symbolizes your base of operations -- the kind of 
home, family and private life that you will experience as a couple. Anything 
that affects your public self will also affect your home life, and vice-versa.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
The Moon is trine the Midheaven.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Together you and your partner probably project a gentle and caring public image. 
Your feelings flow easily in your career and in any other roles you perform in 
the outer world. Therefore, you could find that when you are acting as a unit, 
you and your partner are given tasks that involve dealing with the emotions of 
others or tending to hospitality chores. You might sometimes think that you 
would like to have duties that require more practical skills, but your worldly 
talents include the ability to nurture. And actually you can make good use of 
these talents. There is nothing carved in stone that states that you must 
present a tough public image in order to rule the world. Being kind to others 
and nurturing the people with whom you come into contact publicly will make 
these people willing and able to cooperate with you. A sterner image might 
alienate them, whereas attaining cooperation through tender care will assure you 
quick success in achieving your goals. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Mercury is square the Midheaven.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
In your relationship there’s a connection between your ability to communicate 
and your dealings with the larger world, which you would mostly do through your 
careers. One possibility is that the two of you socialize with the professional 
colleagues of either or both partners. Another is that together you frequently 
discuss career matters or current events. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">You may have few qualms about stating your views. 
Being outspoken can be healthy, but it means that you may not always agree. If 
you voice your differences of opinion in public, others may see you as 
argumentative. If these others are professional associates, this might create 
career problems; and even if you disagree before friends, it can be 
uncomfortable for them. It’s probably better to have your debates in private. If 
you find other subjects on which you can agree and vigorously meet the world 
with those topics, the larger world will see you as dynamic rather than 
argumentative. </span></p>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Saturn is sextile the Midheaven.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
You and your partner want to help each other to solidify your shared public 
image. In your dealings with the outer world you both want to be organized and 
practical. If you share a career, cooperation and clarity are essential 
ingredients and since you agree on that, you will operate easily and well on 
these principles. This will provide joint security for you and your partner. And 
your image in the world will be solid and dependable. Even if you do not share a 
career, your approach and the joint impression you make will be similar when you 
are dealing with the public personally as a couple. You will be thorough and 
deliberate in your course of action and you will probably not take short cuts to 
get to your goals. You may sometimes wish you were less conservative, but 
because of your thoroughness you will undoubtedly succeed at what the two of you 
attempt in the world. </span></p>

In your partnership there is a connection between individuality, excitement and 
your joint public image. So the two of you may be looking for adventure when you 
are out in the world and you could be viewed as an exciting couple. However, 
with this aspect there may be obstacles to overcome to allow you to enjoy your 
individuality and to make the kind of impression you want to make. If either of 
you feels that the other is being too staid or proper, you might begin to act 
strangely, especially in public, in order to get your partner to loosen up. But 
it could have the opposite effect. And the weird behavior, along with the proper 
partner’s response might make the two of you seem bizarre rather than exciting. 
To remedy this you can look for something new and different to do together out 
in the world. It does not have to be something grand, just unusual. And be as 
spontaneous together as you can. This may be enough to alleviate your 
difficulties. </span></p>

Your Conscious Identity As a Couple </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Just as the Sun by far makes up most of the mass of the solar system, the 
astrological Sun is the center of gravity in any chart. The composite Sun is no 
exception. The sign and house that it falls into are, like the signs of the 
Ascendant and Midheaven, likely to signal dominant themes in your relationship.

<span style="color:black">The ruler of daytime and our primary source of light

symbolizes the conscious side, and hence has much to do with our egos, our 
conscious sense of who we are, and the nature of our central mission in life.</span></p>

There can be a deep, spiritual connection between you and your partner and joint 
ego gratification will likely involve non- tangible rewards rather than material 
ones. In fact, your own ego gratification may come as the result of helping 
other people and not by receiving anything for yourself personally. Do be 
careful of being too self-sacrificing. Remind yourself, that it is blessed both 
to give and to receive! You might even use that statement as an affirmation.

<span style="color:black">Another possibility with this placement is that 
together you can have a vivid imagination. So you might not always be realistic 
in your view of the world and you could sometimes tend to delude yourselves 
about people and situations. However, to avoid these pitfalls, you could choose 
to use your imagination creatively. Write a fairy tale, dance, play or listen to 
music together. You might be surprised at how well this approach works. </span>

<span style="color:black">Still another way to use this placement is to 
periodically escape from the real world. You cannot escape forever but 
occasionally spend an evening or a weekend living a fantasy. Take some time, 
occasionally, to create romantic memories. This may make the material world more 
palatable when you return. And who knows, you imagination might also be used to 
manipulate your physical environment effectively. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Although criticism or being taken for granted might 
not cause you to stop working, a little applause will give you an incentive to 
work harder. To feel proud of what you’re doing, you need some positive 
feedback. If you feel unappreciated, you don’t have to put up with this. Look 
elsewhere to be of service. There are always people who are looking for those 
who can work hard, and some of them will surely be openly appreciative of your 
abilities. </span></p>

The Sun is semisquare Saturn.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
With this combination, you and your partner share a need for ego gratification 
that is connected with hard work or structure. But with this aspect, you might 
feel that either your partner, or outside forces present restrictions on you so 
that you find it difficult to attain the ego gratification you are seeking. 
However, it is your joint ego that is involved. And if one of you is feeling 
frustration trying to attain personal gratification, then your shared goals will 
remain out of reach as well. You can, however, achieve success. It will take 
effort, but that is what Saturn is all about. Accept the fact that you must work 
slowly. Form a plan with a series of steps. Do not skip over any steps, and 
evaluate what you have accomplished after you have completed each one. You may 
sometimes still feel frustrated and restricted. But keep focused on your goals. 
You can eventually achieve what you want and your joint gratification will 
strengthen you as a couple. Then you will present a united front. So if

is asserting power, the other should stay in the background but be ready to 
appear when requested. If you behave in this manner, you should not feel so 
threatened by your partner. When the two of you find a balance between ego and 
power, you’ll have a stronger impact on society. </span></p>

You and your partner will be a visible duo as you interact with others. People 
may tend to bring the two of you into the light when you socialize as a couple. 
They either focus attention on you so you have no choice about being seen, or 
else provide you with the confidence to step forward. But, just because you are 
noticed does not necessarily mean that you will be well received. If you are too 
confident you could be perceived as arrogant. Or possibly all the attention 
could give you an inflated sense of self, and you appear condescending or 
self-centered. However, your ego gratification is dependent, at least in part, 
on what others think of you. And if you are not viewed favorably, you will not 
feel good about who you are. Therefore, you should put forth an effort and be 
warm and generous with people with whom you choose to interact. Then they will 
let you know that they approve of you and that will provide the gratification 
you want. </span></p>

If children are an integral part of your partnership, emotions could play an 
important role in your interaction with them. Either or both of you might be 
nurturing toward them, or get emotional about them. Perhaps you both dote on the 
children. Or possibly one of you is protective of them and the other thinks the 
protective partner is overly protective. If this should be the case, you could 
have emotional outbursts over the children. To avoid or alleviate this 
occurring, take a little time away from the children to nurture each other. Each 
of you could mother your partner a bit and provide some love and protection, and 
between the two of you could also add a bit of romance. If you do not share an 
interaction with children, or even if you do, you might choose to use this 
placement in developing or expressing your joint creativity. You could inspire 
each other to manifest talents you did not know you had. Your creativity may be 
sporadic, but when it materializes it will be worth the wait. </span></p>

make your life more fun, that’s certainly OK. If they interfere with your life,

How You Communicate </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
As a couple you develop a style of communication that differs from what you

these styles has drawbacks that you should be conscious of, as well as strengths 
that you can be proud of and use to your advantage.</span></p>

Your composite Mercury is in Aries.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
When you are operating together, you and your partner communicate energetically 
and directly, whether the interaction is between the two of you or with others. 
You tend to speak quickly and sometimes impatiently or forcefully, and your 
meaning will be evident. No one need wonder what you are saying, and it is 
unnecessary to probe for hidden motivation, because there is none. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Because your communication as a couple is rarely 
subdued, you are capable of directness and confrontation. In fact, your 
communication can quickly rise to expressions of anger or uproarious laughter 
depending on the situation. Once you have said what you needed to say, you do 
not drag things out. In other words, your communication is to the point. As a 
couple, you come across as warm, spontaneous, enthusiastic and quick-witted 
communicators, ready to spar with words. But watch your tendency to jump to 
conclusions or to get involved in situations too easily. Your self-assured style 
of communicating could at times be seen as arrogant or self-centered. Make sure 
that you consider the needs of others in any group activities. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Sometimes you speak before you think, especially when

But even if you do not work together professionally, your daily routine in 
general, or the specific tasks you want to perform could be among your favorite 
topics of conversation. In fact, you both may be able to work most efficiently 
if you discuss what must be done before you take action. You might write out a 
schedule or simply get together and verbally plan what needs to be done. If you 
sometimes feel that your work goes slowly because you talk more than you act, 
you might try to get a faster start. However, if you do not plan what you are 
going to do in advance, either or both of you might find it necessary to 
criticize or direct the other while you are working and that could interrupt and 
delay the process more than taking time for an initial planning. </span></p>

You and your partner can be clear and honest with each other when you

each other, but the world will probably see you as uncommunicative as well. 
Since this aspect indicates a need for adjustment, chances are that the two of 
you will have to work on the communications you share. You may tend to direct or 
criticize each other when you are trying to have a conversation. Or possibly one 
or both of you interrupts the other to ask questions or help organize the 
information. None of this will be conducive to free flowing discussions. You 
should each be allowed to talk without interruption or direction and your 
partner should listen. Then questions can be asked. Or set the guidelines first. 
And then talk. Remember that clarity can come. Just be patient and eventually 
everything will be understood. </span></p>

Communications between you and your partner are probably very stimulating. You 
may think faster and more creatively when you are together than either of you do 
individually. However, too much stimulation can lead to overload and the result 
could be not taking time to think through plans or to weigh words. There is also 
the possibility of interfering with each other’s communications by not allowing 
your partner to finish a sentence and jumping to conclusions as to what is going 
to be said. Your conclusions might be incorrect, by the way, and this could lead 
to misunderstandings. You should each be permitted to state your ideas without 
interruption. This can be done without too much effort if you keep statements 
and conversations in general, short. Then you can be creative with the ideas and 
initiate plans. If you do this you might avoid misunderstandings and trying to 
launch untenable plans. And the world may see you as a creative rather than an 
erratic couple. </span></p>

create wonderful stories. But even in general conversation the two of you can 
have a charismatic impact on each other, and mesmerize the world as well. In 
addition, you and your partner could have a strong telepathic connection. So you 
seem to know what the other is thinking before a word is spoken. This will not 
be the case when the two of you are interacting as a couple, with others. 
Therefore, these individuals may not be able to distinguish between what is fact 
and what is fantasy in your communications. If you begin to feel that these

With this combination the planet that represents love and attractiveness (Venus) 
is connected with the planet of sexuality and initiative (Mars). And the aspect 
involved indicates that these energies flow easily between you and your partner. 
So you undoubtedly find each other sexually attractive. And your attitude toward 
each other will make you appear attractive and charming when you are together in 
the world. In describing you as a couple, people will probably say that you are 
pleasant to have around. But you probably will not be viewed as overtly 
assertive. However, you can be effective. When you know what you want you can go 
after it. You just will use diplomacy rather than raw aggression. And because 
you use the approach you do, people may not even realize that you are taking the 
lead. So you are able to accomplish what you want to do without others even 
being aware of it. </span></p>

With this combination, you and your partner can share a powerful passion or you

there is a need for adjustment, so it could take effort to avoid the latter, and 
promote the former. The secret to success is that you each be allowed to assert 
power with your partner’s support. Then you ought to take turns leading the way 
in expressing affection with your partner throwing all passion behind your 
efforts. This should also be the way the two of you deal with others. You should 
alternate asserting power with the other partner totally following the leader. 
If you both have turns at leading and supporting it will be easier to cooperate 
and there will be no need to challenge each other. So power should not be an 
issue between you. And by asserting power in a charming and tactful way in the 
outer world, everyone will want to be on your side. Then you can become power 
figures with cooperation rather than resistance from others. </span></p>

growth and pleasure with these individuals, so you and your partner would not 
stay in relationships with people who either too serious or not intellectually 
compatible with you as a couple. You and your friends might travel together, or 
take classes that will broaden all of you. But whether you are acquiring 
information or having a good time, you might not stop to think of the cost, and 
you could find that you are so focused on what you are doing that you 
over-extend yourselves financially without even realizing it. If you really 
enjoy these people you do not have to give them up. Just look for less expensive 
activities to do with them and you can still have a good time without concern

action, obliterate separate identity and make you anxious about whether you can 
even function in this world. If you listen to what Neptune is trying to tell 
you, though, it can make your relationship sublime and can promote your joining

<span style="color:black">While Pluto can be experienced as disrupting, there’s

Your composite Pluto is in the Twelfth House.</span></b><span style="color:

There is an element of subtlety in the way that you and your partner exert power 
together. You are probably capable of running the world, but you would like to 
do it from behind the scenes. You would have no difficulty giving the orders, 
but you prefer that someone else be the figurehead. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">Your subtlety in dealing with power probably also 
extends to the way you deal with each other. Instead of open confrontations, you 
may prefer subtle manipulation and other covert expressions of power. Remember 
that a manipulated partner may feel ineffectual, and that if you cause each 
other to feel weak as individuals, you will also feel this way as a couple. 
Instead of trying to take advantage of each other, analyze your situation 
together and find ways to express your joint power. As you achieve the ends you 
desire, you will gather strength inwardly. You will still be subtle in your 
expression of power, but you will feel more in control of your lives. </span>

<b><span style="color:black"><br>
Pluto is conjunct the North Node.</span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
In the relationships that you as a couple have with others, power could play an 
important role. Those with whom you interact may be powerful and try to run your 
lives, or they might expect you to take charge. Or possibly you might vie with 
them for top position. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">If the two of you always take the lead, the people 
with whom you are interacting may respect your authority for a time, but they 
will not want you always to be ordering them around. Then, they might challenge 
you, and the situation might turn volatile. On the other hand, if you always 
follow the lead of others, you may eventually feel ineffectual and be driven to 
become the attackers yourselves. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">To avoid all the turmoil, take turns leading and 
following. Then everyone will have a chance to assert power. And when the time 
comes to follow, it will happen without incident because no one will feel 
threatened. </span></p>

<b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><br>
Using Your Composite Chart </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Just as relationships develop and have their ups and downs, composite charts 
also develop over time. This happens as the composite chart constantly receives 
transits from the currently moving planets. It also happens as the natal charts 
of the two people involved move forward by progression, constantly creating a 
new progressed composite chart. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

<span style="color:black">The natal composite chart described in this report 
will, however, always describe the basic tone of your relationship. You can 
change the houses and the positions of the Ascendant and Midheaven by moving to 
a different place, but the signs of the planets and the aspects between them 
will remain the same. So take them seriously, and know that in astrology every 
problem carries within it its own unique wisdom or solution. </span></p>

<span style="color:black">Hopefully, this analysis has given you some new 
insights about both the strengths and the possible problem areas of your 
relationship. If you agree that any of these typical kinds of problems apply in 
your case, please don’t be daunted by them! The key to happiness is first to 
recognize and be thankful for whatever you already enjoy about your partner. The 
more attention you place on these areas, the more these enjoyable parts will 
grow. And if there are problems, think of them not as impossible obstacles, but 
as sources of useful information. When you understand what your problems are 
trying to tell you, you’ll see what they’re asking you to do. Then you may see 
problems as the gifts that they are -- opportunities to grow in wisdom and to 
achieve a new level of closeness. </span></p>
