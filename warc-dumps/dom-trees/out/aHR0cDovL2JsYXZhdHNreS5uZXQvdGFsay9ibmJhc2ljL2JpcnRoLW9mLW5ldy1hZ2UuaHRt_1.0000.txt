    <h2>I-Introduction: Theosophy Through the Ages</h2>

    <h3>3.) Birth Of The New Age – Modern Source</h3>

    <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font><b>(Wm. Q. Judge, Theosophical
    Articles Vol. II "The Theosophical Movement")</b>The
    Theosophical Movement, broadly considered, is found in all times
    and in all nations. Wherever thought has struggled to be free,
    where spiritual ideas, as opposed to forms and dogmatism, have
    been promulgated, there the great movement is to be discerned,
    for noble action is inspired by noble thought, and Theosophy
    represents the principles of such thought. H.P. Blavatsky and
    Wm. Q. Judge were co-founders of the original Theosophical Society
    in 1875. The movement begun by them has passed through many changes.
    But from these will arise the nucleus of a universal brotherhood
    of humanity, the formation of which the founders had in view
    from the first. There are today, groups of working students engaged
    in obtaining a theosophical education and in making Theosophy
    available to the community.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>(HPB, Articles Volume I, " Recent Progress in Theosophy")</b><br>
    The theosophical movement was a necessity of the age, and it
    has spread under its own inherent impulsion, and owes nothing
    to adventitious methods. From the first it has had neither money,
    endowment, nor social or governmental patronage to count upon.
    It appealed to certain human instincts and aspirations, and held
    a certain lofty ideal of perfectibility, with which the vested
    extraneous interests of society conflicted, and against which
    these were foredoomed to battle. Its strongest allies were the
    human yearnings for light upon the problem of life, and for a
    nobler conception of the origin, destiny, and potentialities
    of the human being. While materialism and its congener, secularism,
    were bent upon destroying not only theology and sectarian dogmatism,
    but even the religious conception of a diviner Self, theosophy
    has aimed at uniting all broad religious people for research
    into the actual basis of religion and scientific proofs of the
    existence and permanence of the higher Self. Accepting thankfully
    the results of scientific study and exposure of theological error,
    and adopting the methods and maxims of science, its advocates
    try to save from the wreck of cults the precious admixture of
    truth to be found in each. Discarding the theory of miracle and
    supernaturalism, they endeavor to trace out the kinship of the
    whole family of world-faiths to each other, and their common
    reconciliation with science.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>(HPB, Articles Vol. I, "Recent Progress in Theosophy")</b><br>
    At least we may claim to have placed before the thinking public
    a logical, coherent, and philosophical scheme of man’s origin,
    destiny, and evolution – a scheme preeminent above all for
    its rigorous adherence to justice. And, that we may broaden our
    criterion of truth, our research extends to an inquiry into the
    nature of the less known forces, cosmic and psychical.</p>

    <p>For many a year the "great orphan," Humanity, has
    been crying aloud in the darkness for guidance and for light.
    Amid the increasing splendors of a progress purely material,
    of a science that nourished the intellect, but left the spirit
    to starve, Humanity, dimly feeling its origin and presaging its
    destiny, has stretched out towards the East empty hands that
    only a spiritual philosophy can fill. Aching from the divisions,
    the jealousies, the hatreds that rend its very life, it has cried
    for some sure foundation on which to build the solidarity it
    senses, some metaphysical basis from which its loftiest social
    ideals may rise secure. Only the Masters of the Eastern wisdom
    can set that foundation, can satisfy at once the intellect and
    the spirit, can guide Humanity safely through the night to "the
    dawn of a larger day." Such is the goal which theosophy
    has set itself to attain; such is the history of the modern movement;
    such is the work which theosophy has already accomplished in
    this nineteenth century.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>(Wm. Q. Judge, Articles Vol. I, "Theosophy Generally
    Stated")</b><br>
    The claim is made that an impartial study of history, religion
    and literature will show the existence from ancient times of
    a great body of philosophical, scientific and ethical doctrine
    forming the basis and origin of all similar thought in modern
    systems. It is at once religious and scientific, asserting that
    religion and science should never be separated…Man, being
    spirit and immortal, is able to perpetuate his real life and
    consciousness, and has done so during all time in the persons
    of those higher flowers of the human race who are members of
    an ancient and high brotherhood who concern themselves with the
    soul development of man, held by them to include every process
    of evolution on all planes. Therefore from time to time they
    give out again and again the same doctrine from which time to
    time grows obscured in various nations and places.</p>

    <p>From this living and presently acting body of perfected men
    H.P. Blavatsky declared she received the impulse to once more
    bring forward the old ideas, and from them also received several
    keys to ancient and modern doctrines that had been lost during
    modern struggles toward civilization, and also that she was furnished
    by them with some doctrines really ancient but entirely new to
    the present day in any exoteric shape. These she wrote among
    the other keys furnished by her to her fellow members and the
    world at large. Added, then, to the testimony through all time
    found in records of all nations we have this modern explicit
    assertion that the ancient learned and humanitarian body of adepts
    still exists on this earth and takes an interest in the development
    of the race.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>(HPB, Key To Theosophy, pp 304-306)<br>
    </b><strong>THE FUTURE OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY</strong></p>

    <p>ENQUIRER. Tell me, what do you expect for Theosophy in the
    future?</p>

    <p>THEOSOPHIST. If you speak of THEOSOPHY, I answer that, as
    it has existed eternally throughout the endless cycles upon cycles
    of the Past, so it will ever exist throughout the infinitudes
    of the Future, because Theosophy is synonymous with EVERLASTING
    TRUTH.</p>

    <p>ENQUIRER. Pardon me; I meant to ask you rather about the prospects
    of the Theosophical Society.</p>

    <p>THEOSOPHIST. Its future will depend almost entirely upon the
    degree of selflessness, earnestness, devotion, and last, but
    not least, on the amount of knowledge and wisdom possessed by
    those members, on whom it will fall to carry on the work, and
    to direct the Society after the death of the Founders.</p>

    <p>ENQUIRER. I quite see the importance of their being selfless
    and devoted, but I do not quite grasp how their <em>knowledge
    </em>can be as vital a factor in the question as these other
    qualities. Surely the literature which already exists, and to
    which constant additions are still being made, ought to be sufficient?</p>

    <p>THEOSOPHIST. I do not refer to technical knowledge of the
    esoteric doctrine, though that is most important; I spoke rather
    of the great need which our successors in the guidance of the
    Society will have of unbiased and clear judgment. Every such
    attempt as the Theosophical Society has hitherto ended in failure,
    because, sooner or later, it has degenerated into a sect, set
    up hard-and-fast dogmas of its own, and so lost by imperceptible
    degrees that vitality which living truth alone can impart. You
    must remember that all our members have been bred and born in
    some creed or religion, that all are more or less of their generation
    both physically and mentally, and consequently that their judgment
    is but too likely to be warped and unconsciously biased by some
    or all of these influences. If, then, they cannot be freed from
    such inherent bias, or at least taught to recognize it instantly
    and so avoid being led away by it, the result can only be that
    the Society will drift off on to some sandbank of thought or
    another, and there remain a stranded carcass to moulder and die.</p>

    <p>ENQUIRER. But if this danger be averted?</p>

    <p>THEOSOPHIST. Then the Society will live on into and through
    the twentieth century. It will gradually leaven and permeate
    the great mass of thinking and intelligent people with its large-minded
    and noble ideas of Religion, Duty, and Philanthropy. Slowly but
    surely it will burst asunder the iron fetters of creeds and dogmas,
    of social and caste prejudices; it will break down racial and
    national antipathies and barriers, and will open the way to the
    practical realization of the Brotherhood of all men. Through
    its teaching, through the philosophy which it has rendered accessible
    and intelligible to the modern mind, the West will learn to understand
    and appreciate the East at its true value. Further, the development
    of the psychic powers and faculties, the premonitory symptoms
    of which are already visible in America, will proceed healthily
    and normally. Mankind will be saved from the terrible dangers,
    both mental and bodily, which are inevitable when that unfolding
    takes place, as it threatens to do, in a hot-bed of selfishness
    and all evil passions. Man's mental and psychic growth will proceed
    in harmony with his moral improvement, while his material surroundings
    will reflect the peace and fraternal good-will which will reign
    in his mind, instead of the discord and strife which is everywhere
    apparent around us to-day.</p>
