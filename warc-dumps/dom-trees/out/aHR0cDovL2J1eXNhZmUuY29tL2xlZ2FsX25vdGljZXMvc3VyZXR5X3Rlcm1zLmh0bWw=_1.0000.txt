	      <h1>Surety Terms &amp; Conditions </h1>
	      <p>These Terms and Conditions are designed to provide You, the merchant who chooses to accept these terms and conditions,&nbsp; (“You”), with important information and obligations about the surety bond coverage for which your business may be eligible, dependent upon comprehensive underwriting to be performed by &nbsp;(a) Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty"), (b) The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc., and (c) ACE American Insurance Company (each a “Surety” and collectively, the “Sureties”) &nbsp;or one of their subsidiaries or affiliates through buySAFE, Inc. — the Sureties’ licensed, duly authorized and appointed agent ("Agent") on the www.buysafe.com website (the "Website"). You must read, agree with, and accept all of these Terms and Conditions, including without limitation the Indemnification Section and the terms and conditions in our Privacy Policy, by providing your electronic signature below.</p>
	      <p>The Sureties, or any Surety, or its Agent, (collectively “We”) may amend these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the amended terms on the Website. Except as stated below, or as otherwise required by law, all amended terms shall automatically be effective fourteen (14) days after they are initially posted on the Website or sent to You via email.</p>
	      <p>The &nbsp;surety bond ("Bond") coverage offered through the Website is available only to businesses in good standing. This product is available only on-line and contemplates the electronic transmission of business. Our services are not available to any individual or entity that poses, in our sole discretion, an unacceptable level of underwriting or business risk. Please note, if You reside outside of the United States, the Bond is not yet available for your use.</p>
	      <p><strong>I. Underwriting Application Process.</strong></p>
	      <p>A. The Sureties’ ability to underwriting depends upon your completion of the information requested through the buySAFE.com registration process ("Application"). You agree to provide buySAFE, as the Sureties’ Agent, with accurate and complete information about your business at all times. If any information that You provide to buySAFE or us changes, You agree to immediately notify us of such changes at the Website or in writing at the address for notices set forth below. This information includes but is not limited to your name and address, telephone number, social security number, e-mail address, business name, credit card number, billing address along with the expiration date, bank account name, bank account and routing number and marketplace user name and password and license number (if required).</p>
	      <p>B. You agree never to impersonate any other person or entity, misrepresent your affiliation with another person, entity or association, use false headers or otherwise conceal your true identity from us for any purpose. We will treat the information that You provide us in accordance with our then-current Privacy Policy, which can be found online at the following websites: (a) http://www.libertymutual.com; (b) http://www.travelers.com; (c) http://www.ace-ina.com.</p>
	      <p><strong>II. Authorization.</strong> By signing below You also represent that You are authorized to do business in accordance with all state and federal laws. You agree that we may periodically verify the information You provided or that we otherwise obtained, although we have no obligation to do so at any time. Your failure to respond to any inquiries by us or our authorized agents may lead to the suspension or revocation of the Bond coverage.</p>
	      <p><strong>III. Seller's Statement of Business Purpose.</strong> By signing below, You acknowledge, agree and represent that You have requested surety bond coverage from the Sureties through its Agent for business and commercial purposes and not for personal, family, household or other consumer purposes, even if You are an individual and have not utilized the services of any Surety or its Agent previously. You further acknowledge and agree that this statement is made under the penalties of perjury and that the submission of fraudulent or misleading statements to an insurance company or insurance agent may subject You to civil liability and criminal penalties.</p>
	      <p><strong>IV. Identity Verification. </strong>You agree that we may, directly or through third parties, make any inquiries we deem appropriate regarding your business from various sources, including but not limited to obtaining information from consumer reporting agencies, the internet marketplace where your business will be offering products for sale, and others to help us identify You or for any other legally permitted purposes, including to assist us in evaluating your Bond Application and ongoing compliance with the Standards &amp; Prohibited Items Section of these Terms and Conditions. You also agree that we may order a credit report and perform other credit checks or otherwise verify the information You provide or that we obtain against third party databases.</p>
	      <p><strong>V. Bond.</strong> Upon your satisfaction of our underwriting criteria, the Sureties, acting through buySAFE as the Sureties’ Agent, shall provide a Bond that financially guarantees that You (the principal) will fulfill the conditions of sale of an on-line sales transaction to the buyer (the obligee) who is your on-line sales transaction winner. (A copy of the Bond can be found on the buySAFE website www.buysafe.com).</p>
	      <p> <strong>VI. Bond Premium and Fees.</strong><br>
          A. You authorize the Sureties, or buySAFE as the Sureties’ Agent, to charge any and all fees and premiums payable as set forth in the buySAFE pricing schedule section to the credit card, debit card or bank account You specify as part of your Application, including reasonable fees in connection with an electronic debit returned for any reason and any costs related to enforcement of these Terms and Conditions. You agree to be billed on a monthly basis for all such amounts incurred during the preceding month. Such bills will be sent to You by buySAFE in its role as the Sureties’ licensed Agent. The specific terms and conditions with respect to payment by credit card, debit card or bank account are set forth below.</p>
	      <p>B. You agree that the Sureties, or buySAFE acting as the Sureties’ Agent may charge reasonable fees in connection with an electronic debit returned for any reason, such as insufficient funds or a stop-payment order.</p>
	      <p>C. You authorize the Sureties and Agent to charge any and all fees and premiums payable as set forth in this buySAFE pricing schedule to the credit card, debit card or bank account You specify as part of your Application, including reasonable fees in connection with an electronic debit returned for any reason and any costs related to enforcement of these Terms and Conditions. You agree to be billed on a monthly basis for all such amounts incurred during the preceding month. Such bills will be sent to You by buySAFE in its role as the Sureties’ licensed Agent. For specific terms and conditions with respect to payment by credit card, debit card or bank account, please see below.</p>
	      <p><strong>VII. No License to Trademarks.</strong> In order for the items authorized by the Sureties to be bonded, You acknowledge and agree that buySAFE will place on the individual on-line transaction site the buySAFE, Inc. ("buySAFE") seal (the "Seal"). You have no rights in or license to buySAFE, the Seal, the buySAFE name, the Sureties’ name, the Sureties’ logo or any trademarks of either. You will not attempt to copy, display, distribute or in any way use any of the foregoing in any manner whatsoever.</p>
	      <p><strong>VIII. Standards and Revocation.</strong> You agree that we may suspend or permanently terminate providing Bond coverage for your on-line transactions at any time and without notice if: (a) You fail to keep the information You provide to us current, including your contact information; (b) buySAFE suspends your usage of the Seal for any reason; (c) You are not a member in good standing on the marketplace for which You have requested bonds; (d) buySAFE as Agent receives an excessive number of complaints about your selling practices and/or standards; (e) You exceed your authorized Bond program limit; or (f) we experience unacceptably high levels of claim activity as determined in our sole discretion. We will send You notice of such suspension or termination promptly.</p>
	      <p> <strong>IX. On-line Dispute Resolution Process and Making a Claim. </strong>When a buyer becomes dissatisfied with his or her transaction, the buyer is asked to initiate on-line problem resolution (the "buySAFE Dispute Resolution Process") by using the "Report a Problem Transaction" form at the Website. A buyer's completion of this form will enable You and your buyers to communicate directly with each other, and if necessary, to enlist the aid of a buySAFE "Problem Solver," an unbiased problem resolution specialist. If a buyer has been unable to resolve his problem transaction with you, via the buySAFE Dispute Resolution Process or otherwise, and files a claim with one or more of the Sureties seeking payment under a Bond, the Sureties will investigate the claim and may take action to compensate such buyer for his or her loss (e.g. provide buyer a replacement product or refund the full purchase price) and then seek recovery from You as provided for in the Indemnification Section (see below). Both buyer and You must fully participate in the buySAFE Dispute Resolution Process, to the extent permitted by law. Where the buySAFE Dispute Resolution Process is not permitted by law, buyer may file a notice of potential claim by emailing Agent at claim@buysafe.com with a description of the claim, the item number and the Bond number.</p>
	      <p><strong>X. Your Responsibilities in the event of a Claim. </strong>You agree to cooperate and participate in good faith and in a timely manner with respect to each reported problem transaction and claim and to respond to all calls or e-mails sent to You by one or more of the Sureties, either directly or through its Agent, after receipt of such calls or e-mails. You also agree to provide information to the Sureties and the buyer in connection with the claim that is true, accurate and complete and does not contain any false or misleading information. Further, You authorize the Sureties to provide, in accordance with the Sureties’ Privacy Policy, third parties any information we obtain on you, including but not limited to information we obtain as part of the buySAFE Dispute Resolution Process and the claim handling process.</p>
	      <p><strong>XI. Your Additional Responsibilities.</strong></p>
	      <p>A. You agree not to:</p>
	      <p>1. Impersonate any person or entity or use a name or alias that You are not authorized to use;</p>

You agree to waive any and all defenses as against the Sureties with respect to any coverage decision and agree to seek any necessary restitution directly against the buyer or other third parties. You agree to assign to the Sureties, upon request from them, any rights You may have to recover from any third parties.</p>
