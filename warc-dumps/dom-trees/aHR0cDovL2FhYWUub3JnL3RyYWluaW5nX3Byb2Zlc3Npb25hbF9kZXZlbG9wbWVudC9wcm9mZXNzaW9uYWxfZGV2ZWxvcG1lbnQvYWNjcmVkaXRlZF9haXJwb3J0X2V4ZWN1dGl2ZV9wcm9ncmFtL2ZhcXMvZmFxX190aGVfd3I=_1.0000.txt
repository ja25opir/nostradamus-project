Recognize that many topics are too narrow to be developed into a management paper. It's important that your paper be relevant and valuable to other airport managers; given this criterion, your subject should not be a description of a unique activity, incident, or process at your airport. Rather, in a management research paper, you propose a set of guidelines for managing a problem or sets forth an argument for implementing a project or using a methodology. Focusing on a topic that is broadly applicable to many airports, you bring your experience and research findings to bear on your analysis. Both the examples cited and the research data (including personal interviews and surveys) that are used to support your analysis come from more than a few sources.<p></p>    <p><em><strong>For the case study</strong></em>--A case study is essentially a report in which you recount/analyze the steps or measures taken by your airport or airport system (same ownership) in implementing a project or managing a problem. It is essentially a how-we-did-it kind of process analysis, complete with data used by your airport or airport system for the project. Your topic should, therefore, be one that lends itself to such an analysis. The study should contribute something innovative and unique to airport management.</p>    <p>For a list of management paper topics available in the AAAE library, view <a href="http://www.aaae.org/membership/information_library/" target="_blank">Library Management Papers</a>.

Please allow at least one week to receive your assessment.</p>    <p>This outline must include a stated objective for the paper or case study, as well as a short description of each section and subsection.
