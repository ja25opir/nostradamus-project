Archeologists Race Against Time at Three Gorges</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archeological task forces armed with 
little scoops and brushes are sweating away in southwest China, racing against 
the clock to rescue cultural relics facing submersion under the Three Gorges 
Reservoir. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These special forces, consisting of 
archeologists from two thirds of China's archeological institutions, have turned 
the reservoir area into the world's biggest archeological worksite. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It is unprecedented in China's history 
of cultural relics salvation," said Qiao Liang, who is one of the policymakers 
defining the cultural relics rescue program. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The investment and people engaged in 
cultural relics salvationby the Central Government have surpassed any other 
hydro-electric project in the world," said Qiao, who was summoned more than 
1,000kilometers from Beijing to the Three Gorges area. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The archeologists have been busy 
excavating cultural relics in recent weeks. The sluice gate of the Three Gorges 
dam is set to close on June 1 when the water level will start to rise rapidly 
toa planned altitude of 135 meters in 15 days. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By the end of last year, China had 
allocated more than 300 million yuan (36 million US dollars) in special funds to 
excavate and protect cultural relics in Three Gorges Reservoir area. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">More than 7,000 archeological experts, 
academics and technicians from across the country are racing against time to 
protect the centuries-old legacy of their ancestors. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The artifacts include prehistoric 
cultural relics dating back to the Old Stone Age more than two million years 
ago, cultural sites of ancient dynasties from the Xia Dynasty (21st Century BC 
to 16th Century BC) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some nine million square meters of the 
reservoir area had been prospected by April, and more than 6,000 precious 
cultural items and 600,000 other cultural heritage items recovered. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Our excavation work in the Three Gorges 
Reservoir area is about 10 times the amount of that during ordinary times," said 
Huang Wei, an archeological professor at Chengdu-based Sichuan University.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">China began its cultural relic salvation 
work in the reservoir area in 1992 when a protection and rescue program were 
framed, with a total investment reaching one billion yuan (120 million US 
dollars). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The annual investment in the Three 
Gorges cultural relics by the central government was about the same allocated to 
the country's other major cultural relics combined, according to Shao Weidong,an 
official in charge of Three Gorge cultural relics management, in Chongqing, 
where lies most of the reservoir's submerged area. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"That means the cultural relics rescue 
efforts in the reservoirarea are enjoying the same treatment as top state 
treasures," Shaosaid. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With the clock still clicking, many 
advanced modern technologies have been introduced to the prospecting and 
excavation, including remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar andglobal 
positioning technologies. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The excavation of the cultural relics 
buried below the 135-meter water level has been completed on schedule. Plan are 
on the drawing board to salvage other cultural relics after the raising of the 
water level. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Construction on the Three Gorges Project 
began in 1993 and is expected to be completed in 2009, when 632 square 
kilometers of land will be submerged. </span></p>

Assyrian Treasures Believed Found in Baghdad </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">National Geographic Ultimate Explorer</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">June 2, 2003</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Gold jewelry and other precious items 
recovered from royal tombs excavated at the ancient Assyrian capital of Nimrud 
are believed to have been found where they were stashed for safety—in a vault 
below the Central Bank in Baghdad—before the onset of the Gulf War in 1990.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The 2,800-year-old treasures—which were 
characterized by one British archaeologist authority as the most significant 
discovery since Tutankhamun's treasures in 1923—are thought to be in three cases 
that had been sealed and secured in the underground vault. They were not found 
until last week because the basement of the bank was flooded, possibly 
deliberately by bank officials as a way to protect them from looters. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A gold crown found in one of the royal 
tombs in Nimrud, the ancient Assyrian capital. Also in the tombs, which were 
excavated in the late 1980s, were dozens of other artifacts, several skeletons, 
and an inscription of a curse on anyone who disturbed the burial site, calling 
on the gods to impose "restlessness" on his spirit and corpse for all eternity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Images of some of the exquisite 
treasures once housed in Baghdad's Iraq Museum—photographs made for National 
Geographic magazine but never published—have been released as part of the 
National Geographic Society's contribution to locating and preventing illegal 
trade in the artifacts. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Where are Iraq's antiquities? 
Photographer Alexandra Boulat covers this and other topics in her eyewitness

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Emergency draining of the vault levels 
to gain access to Iraq's currency reserves, needed to pay salaries throughout 
the country, led to confirmation that the cases containing the Nimrud treasures 
were still intact. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We have assistance from our friends 
[at] National Geographic who brought [a] pumping system and hired people to [do] 
this job for us free of charge," said Ahmed Muhammad, deputy governor of Iraq's 
Central Bank. "We thank them very much for this favor," he told the National 
Geographic Ultimate Explorer team which helped the bank drain the water from the 
basement. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Ultimate Explorer team was in 
Baghdad to make news documentaries. The story of the Central Bank vault and 
recovery of the artifacts will be aired on Ultimate Explorer on MSNBC on July 6. 
The show will be presented by Lisa Ling, who was in Baghdad for part of the 
recovery effort. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The bank was flooded right up to the 
ground level," said Gayle Young, director of story development, Ultimate 
Explorer. "It took three pumps and three weeks to get all the water out. At 
first the water kept flooding into the bank as fast as we pumped it out, but 
then it was discovered there was a valve that was open. Once we were able to 
shut that off we could drain all the water and the bank officials gained access 
to the vaults," Young said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Young said the three boxes that 
contained the treasures were found in the seventh vault that was inspected, 
exactly where it was believed they would be. An archaeologist who placed the 
seals on the boxes confirmed that they had not been broken. "We expect that they 
will be opened tomorrow in the presence of experts and witnesses," Young said.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Muhammed said that he asked that at 
least two employees of the Central Bank observe the opening of the boxes, and 
the verification and listing of their contents. "The pieces belong to Iraq and 
not only to Iraqi Museum, and we at the Central Bank of Iraq feel we have a 
share in these boxes because we kept them for 14 years since 1990," he said.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Draining the water from the vaults 
became a priority, not only to determine if the treasures had escaped the 
looting that had taken place on the bank's upper floors during the recent war in 
Iraq, but because the authorities urgently needed to recover the country's cash 
reserves. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We had a crisis situation where we 
needed to get access to the dinars in the vaults of the Central Bank to pay 
salaries, and thanks to National Geographic we've been able to open the vaults, 
to pump out the water, and pay the salaries," said Jacob Nell, advisor to Iraq's 
Ministry of Finance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cash was recovered, wet but intact. The 
"water was impregnated with soot and not as we feared with sewage, so it's just 
like they've been through the washing machine and the money is clean," Nel told 
the Ultimate Explorer team. "Thanks to National Geographic we were able to pump 
the water out of the vaults, which means that we could get access to the dinars 
that were stored there, which was essential for us to be able to pay April 
salaries throughout the country. " </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Confirmation that the treasures of 
Nimrud are in safe custody will be a relief to the archaeological and art 
communities. There have been widespread fears that they were looted along with 
thousands of artifacts stripped from the Iraq Museum and archaeological sites in 
the chaos of the war in Iraq and its aftermath. </span></p>

aims to virtually restore Iraq treasures </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Adam Tanner </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Iraq's 
cultural treasures, recently ravaged by looting and war, could be virtually 
restored through an ambitious project that would create an online panorama of 
that cradle of human civilisation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The University of California at Berkeley 
is seeking $5 million over five years for a computer-based project to chronicle 
Iraq's museums and archaeological digs, a university official said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The resulting Web site would offer 
photographs, text and real-time details such as the humidity or earthquake 
activity at research sites. Sensors on key relics would even alert the network 
if thieves try to steal them. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Now the U.S. has the upper hand in 
Iraq, and I feel that in some ways it is our obligation to help part of the 
restoration and reconstruction," said Ruzena Bajcsy, director of Berkeley's 
Centre for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I am using Iraq as an opportunity for 
promoting the idea of a virtual heritage, cultural heritage encyclopaedia," said 
Bajcsy, who is from Slovakia. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The fragile state of Iraqi's rich 
cultural heritage was highlighted when looters stole items from the National 
Museum in Baghdad after U.S.-led military forces toppled the regime of Saddam 
Hussein. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The looting was a public relations 
disaster for Washington. Many criticised the U.S. military for failing to 
prevent the ravaging of cultural treasures while at the same time providing 
stepped up patrols at the ministry of oil. Looting has continued in recent weeks 
at archaeological sites, experts say. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In a separate but related effort, 
University of Chicago's Oriental Institute has also started categorising about 
7,000 items from the Iraqi National Museum, said McGuire Gibson, an Iraq 
specialist and professor there who returned from Baghdad last week. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The museum already has a Web site 
running at (http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/IRAQ/iraq.html) with details and 
pictures from the museum. A fuller online catalogue is upcoming. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Gibson said Iraqi museum officials have 
identified 1,000 objects that are lost out of a total collection of hundreds of 
thousands of items, and said in the end the number of identified looted items 
would likely rise to 3,000 to 4,000. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Think about losing 3,000 to 4,000 
objects in any major museum," he said in an interview. "It is a major loss 
regardless." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He said the museum has recovered 1,200 
objects in recent weeks although some are reproductions and other works with 
lesser value. </span></p>

Return Looted African Obelisk</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">May 30, 2003 — A daredevil flight might 
soon end a decades-long diplomatic dispute between Italy and Ethiopia over a 
looted obelisk.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Carrying 160-ton granite blocks, the 
plane would land on a small airstrip in Ethiopia, returning to its original 
country a 78-foot-high granite stele that now stands at the center of Rome's 
Piazza di Porta, near the Colosseum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The monument is one of a group of six 
obelisks erected at Axum when Ethiopia adopted Christianity in the 4th century 
A.D. It was stolen by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in 1937 and turned 
into a symbol of fascist power during his short-lived efforts to revive the 
grandeur of imperial Rome. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Despite signing various bilateral 
agreements promising to return the 1,700-year old monument, the Italian 
government showed no signs of doing so until the obelisk was badly damaged by 
lightning in a thunderstorm last year. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The thunderstorm smashed the top of the 
structure, causing stone pieces to crash to the ground. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The restoration is over, we were able 
to reassemble the missing parts. The obelisk is back to its original look," 
Rome's archaeological superintendent Adriano La Regina told reporters. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry 
Under-Secretary Alfredo Mantica confirmed Italy's decision to finally return the 
monument. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The obelisk will be cut in four pieces, 
including a heavy part of the monument which is now underground," Mantica said
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Returning the obelisk would be no easy 
feat. When Mussolini took it to Italy, it was already in fragments. It was 
restored in Rome using metal rods embedded in concrete, making it very hard to 
disassemble. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I very much hope that the Axum obelisk 
will soon be back on the site in Ethiopia where it was erected so long ago. The 
obelisks at Axum are wonderful monuments, not only to the levels of civilization 
in this part of Africa some 2,000 years ago, but also to the engineering skills 
that enabled such massive stones to be erected," Christopher Clapham of the 
Center of African Studies at Cambridge University, told Discovery News. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He added that the return of this obelisk 
was Italy's explicit obligation under the terms of the treaties that ended World 
War II. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It should be a matter of deep shame and 
regret that the successive governments of Italy should have failed, over a 
period of nearly sixty years, to honor their own obligations, or to make 
restitution for the damage that Italian fascism did to Ethiopia," Clapham said.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to Mantica, once the obelisk 
is disassembled, it will be put in a storage room as a flight back to Ethiopia 
is set up. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Ethiopia's government required that the 
monument is transported by a plane, but there are only two kind of planes able 
to carry that weight. We wonder whether the airstrip will bear the obelisk's 
huge weight," Mantica said. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Laden with Italian marble, glass mosaic 
stones and glazed wall tiles – remains of which were all found at the site – the 
romanesque cathedral was as extraordinary in its beauty as in its size. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It was the largest house of worship 
north of the Alps apart from the Cologne Cathedral," said Kuhn, adding that it 
was believed to have measured 80 metres long and 60 metres high. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Historian Babette Ludowici said the 
discovery in Magdeburg could lead to a rewriting of the early days of the Holy 
Roman Empire, a loose federation of peoples ruled by a Christian dynasty that 
aspired to the glory of the Roman Empire. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Foundation stones have just been 
discovered and are believed to have been part of the western wing of the church, 
construction of which began in 955. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Cathedral of Magdeburg was dedicated 
in 968. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was Otto the Great's final resting 
place, but was destroyed by fire in 1207. It was replaced in 1209 by the gothic 
Magdeburg Cathedral. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It had been believed the ancient church 
was on the same site as today's cathedral, but the recent finds now put the site 
50 metres to the south. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeological digs being carried out by 
the Antiquities Authority in the old city of Tiberias have revealed impressive 
remains of the gate and wall of the city's 12th century Crusader fortress.&nbsp; The 
digs are part of a tourism development project</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">initiated by the Tourism Ministry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The digs are underway along the Lake 
Kinneret promenade, close to the Rabbi Haim Abulafiya ancient synagogue, with 
the assistance of the Tiberias Municipality and the Avnei Derekh and Rushrush 
companies. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of the posts of the gate that has 
been uncovered shows a portion of a magnificently decorated crossbeam.&nbsp; 
According to Yossi Stapensky, who is overseeing the dig on behalf of the 
Antiquities Authority, "It appears that this item, which originated from a 
public building from the Roman era, was incorporated into the fort to beautify 
the gate and impress all those coming into the city." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The wall of the fortress is constructed 
of large basalt stones and is the widest (3.4 meters) uncovered till now in 
Tiberias. Portions of the wall are also believed to have come from a public 
structure from the Roman era. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It appears that the fortress was 
surrounded by a deep moat filled with water from Lake Kinneret that protected 
its entrance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The well-preserved condition of the gate 
makes it possible to uncover the structure in its entirety, and the site will be 
incorporated into the tourism development project planned alongside the lake's 
promenade in the future. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On July 2, 1187, Salah a-Din and his 
army besieged the Tiberias fortress. The Crusaders who got word of the siege 
left for the city to free their besieged comrades. But on July 4, on the way to 
Tiberias, the Crusaders were attacked by Salah</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">a-Din's forces. The ensuing battle 
resulted in victory for the Muslim. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is believed that this battle 
determined the fate of the Land of Israel: Had the Muslims been defeated, the 
entire region may very well have remained till today under Christian and 
European rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

Columbus Remains in Spain Exhumed </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mon Jun 2, 8:57 PM ET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By CIARAN GILES, Associated Press Writer
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">MADRID, Spain - A chest containing the 
supposed remains of Christopher Columbus was exhumed Monday for DNA and other 
tests to determine whether the bones are really those of the famed explorer.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The test aims to settle a long debate 
over where Colombus is buried: in Spain's Seville Cathedral or in a sprawling 
monument in the Dominican Republic's capital, Santo Domingo. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the presence of two descendants of 
Columbus — Jaime and Anunicada Colon de Carvajal — researchers removed two boxes 
from an ornate tomb at the cathedral in the southern city of Seville. One box is 
believed to hold the explorer's bones; the other is known to hold those of his 
son Hernando. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Another box, thought to contain the 
bones of Colombus' brother Diego, was exhumed close to Seville. All three were 
taken across southern Spain, with a police escort, to the University of Granada.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"This is possibly the first time the 
three ever traveled together," joked Marcial Castro, the researcher who launched 
the project. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Granada, experts will conduct an 
array of tests — including DNA analysis — to find out if the two sets of remains 
in question are related to those of Hernando, whose identity is certain. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Castro says he believes the true bones 
are in Santo Domingo but adds, "No historian in the world has conclusive proof 
of where Columbus is buried. That's what we're trying to find out." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Castro said the exhumation Monday was 
tense. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We thought we might just find a pile of 
dust in the box," he said. "But there were plenty of bones for the scientists to 
work off." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The results of the tests will not be 
known for several months. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Researchers have asked to exhume the 
supposed remains in Santo Domingo as well, but Dominican authorities are waiting 
to see the outcome of the Spanish tests, Castro said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All three sets of remains will be 
returned to their resting places Friday, he said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Columbus died and was buried in the 
Spanish city of Valladolid on May 20, 1506, although he had asked to be buried 
in the Americas. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Three years later, his remains were 
moved to a monastery on La Cartuja, next to Seville. In 1537, Maria de Rojas y 
Toledo, widow of another of Columbus' sons, Diego, sent the bones of her husband 
and his father to the cathedral in Santo Domingo for burial. There they lay 
until 1795, when Spain ceded the island to France but decided Columbus' remains 
should not fall into the hands of foreigners. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So a set of remains that the Spaniards 
believed were Columbus' were shipped to Havana and, when the Spanish-American 
War broke out in 1898, over to Seville. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However, in 1877, workers digging in the 
Santo Domingo cathedral unearthed a leaden box containing bones and bearing the 
inscription, "Illustrious and distinguished male, don Cristobal Colon" — as 
Columbus is called in Spanish — thus sparking the controversy. </span></p>

burial site found outside archeologist's office</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An ancient Indian burial ground believed 
to contain hundreds of skeletal remains was inadvertently discovered by a 
backhoe operator in Midland, Ont., while digging beside a tourist attraction of 
a recreated native village.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Police, the local coroner, archeologists 
and First Nations elders were called to the site beside Huron Village after the 
previously unknown grave site, from about 1500 AD, was uncovered on Thursday 
during construction of a community arena.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I've been an archeologist for 35 years 
and it is rather ironic that just 75 feet from my office is an undetected, 
undisturbed Huron ossuary," said Jamie Hunter, curator of the museum and 
village.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Hunter had told workers to be on the 
lookout during construction because of the area's history.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"When the backhoe operator realized what 
he was dealing with wasn't tree roots but bones, he immediately stopped and came 
and got me and what he had discovered -- to everybody's shock -- was an entire 
Huron ossuary," Mr. Hunter said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He believes the burial pit contains the 
remains of the deceased from an entire village of the Huron people, one of the 
major aboriginal groups in Ontario before European settlement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An elder from Chippewas of Beausoleil 
First Nation, the closest First Nation group to Midland, visited the site on 
Friday and conducted a ceremony for the deceased, said Jack Contin, executive 
director of the G'Nadjiwon Ki Aboriginal Tourism Association, who is a liaison 
between native groups and the municipality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It was a special ceremony with four 
sacred medicines used, and water was presented. The elder gave special prayers 
as a reassurance that, after having being disturbed, all efforts would be taken 
to protect them," he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It was a gesture to the grandfathers 
and grandmothers of the past that the interference was not intended."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A representative of the Huron people is 
scheduled to visit the site today, and more discussions are planned on what to 
do next, Mr. Contin said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Hunter and Dr. Dean Knight, an 
archeologist from Wilfrid Laurier University, will examine the find to determine 
its extent and sift through three dump truck loads of soil that had been removed 
from the area before work was halted in a search for human remains.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Hunter estimates less than a quarter 
of the bodies were disturbed. Because the burial ground was part of the planned 
landscaping between the arena and an access road, there is no need to further 
disturb the site, he added.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The town is likely to declare it a 
protected cemetery and erect a plaque denoting the significance of the site, he 
said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Valerie Monague, chief of the Chippewas 
of Beausoleil, praised the town for promptly contacting First Nations peoples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Huron people historically lived in 
villages for 15 to 25 years and, before moving to a new site, would dig a large 
circular pit, line it with fur or bark and bury those who had died during the 
community's stay there, Mr. Hunter said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The Huron belief is that because they 
were a community in life they should be a community in death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Families would bring the bones of their 
relative in a beaver skin bag and place it in the pit during a nine-day ceremony 
called the Feast of the Dead. The sites were then protected by stones and logs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Hurons were defeated and dispersed 
by the Iroquois in the mid 1600s.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 16.0pt">Britain 
readies digital replicas of Iraqi relics</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Wed May 28, 4:39 PM ET&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">PARIS (AFP) - Britain is making digital 
replicas of 1,000 ancient cuneiform tablets and sending them back to Iraq (news 
- web sites) in a ground-breaking programme to help bolster the rich but 
vulnerable Iraqi cultural heritage. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The request for the replicas came last 
year from the University of Mosul, but it has become especially relevant today 
in the light of the pillaging of Iraq's historical treasures at the end of the 
war last month. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The British weekly New Scientist says 
the 1,000 pieces come from a unique collection, housed at the British Museum in 
London, of 25,000 engraved clay tablets from the library of King Ashurbanipal, 
who ruled Assyria in 650 BC. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tablets range from the epic of 
Gilgamesh, one of the oldest recorded stories in the world, to banal lists of 
farming stocks. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Making silicon or latex casts of the 
tablets could harm their fragile clay surface, so the museum has hired a British 
company to make digital copies of the objects using laser scanners, designed for 
space and military work, that are accurate to within a tenth of a millimetre.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The data can then be used to recreate a 
virtual copy of the tablet, which can be viewed on a computer or over the 
Internet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The museum will hand over digital copies 
of the tablets and is also getting the replicas "printed" into a 
three-dimensional hard copy made of resin which it hopes will be detailed enough 
for display or scholastic study in Iraq. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The request from Mosul was part of an 
effort, funded by Iraqi oil income and channelled through UNESCO (news - web 
sites), to set up a new centre for Assyriology. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The article appears in next Saturday's 
issue of the British science weekly. </span></p>
