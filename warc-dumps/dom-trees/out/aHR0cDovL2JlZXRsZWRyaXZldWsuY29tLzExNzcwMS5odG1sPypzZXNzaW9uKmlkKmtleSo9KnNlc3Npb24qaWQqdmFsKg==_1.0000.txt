Michelle McLaughlin chauffeur" align="left">Hi Clare,&nbsp;I just wanted to drop you a note to say thank you to you, Michelle, Mark&nbsp;and the rest of the team for making our wedding day so special. You may recall it was a very snowy Saturday and our original car, Milo,&nbsp;wasn't allowed out due to the bad weather so we used Mark instead.&nbsp;Initially I was a little disappointed by this news, but as soon as I saw Mark I knew I needn't have worried as he was the perfect car!&nbsp;My dad and myself&nbsp;really enjoyed the drive to the Church in Mark, despite the snow and the nerves!! The drive to the reception as husband and wife was truly memorable, and just wouldn't have been the same in any other car than a VW. &nbsp;Michelle was a fabulous chauffeur, very polite, friendly, and professional. She must have been freezing but didn't complain once! &nbsp;I've attached&nbsp;a few&nbsp;pictures from the day. Unfortunately, I didn't get as many of Mark as I'd hoped as it was FREEZING!! The ones I do have are fab though. &nbsp;Thank you again.&nbsp;Kind regards,&nbsp;Hannah Bevan&nbsp; <b>Hannah &amp; Russell 19th Dec 2010.</b><br clear="all"></p><p><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="400" src="./mediac/400_0/media/DIR_169533/100_0298.jpg" hspace="10" height="533" border="0" alt="Helen &amp; Pete Godden Nottingham" align="left">Dear Clare<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you so much for lending us Herbie on our wedding day, 7th August.

It added so much to, an already fantastic day.<br><br>We also wanted to thank you for sending us the most wonderful driver, Chris.

You've got a gem working for you there. <br>&nbsp;<br>He also spoke very highly of you and your company, and we can only agree with what he said. From the moment&nbsp;we saw Herbie on the website,&nbsp;to&nbsp;when we waved goodbye to him at Eastwood Hall, the experience has been fun and 100% stress free.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, thank you very much for recommending <a target="_blank" href="http://www.samuelkirby.com">Sam Kirby</a>, the photographer.
