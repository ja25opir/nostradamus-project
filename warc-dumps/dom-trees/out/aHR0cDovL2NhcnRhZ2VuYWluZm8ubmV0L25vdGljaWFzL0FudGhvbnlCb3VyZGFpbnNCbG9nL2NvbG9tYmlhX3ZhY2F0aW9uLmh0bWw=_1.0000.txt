                      <p class="Estilo4">By Anthony Bourdain on July 10, 2008 9:38 AM | Permalink 
                        | 370 Comments</p>
                      <p> <span class="Estilo2">It's all too common in Latin America, 
                        where the divide between rich and poor is usually very 
                        wide, to hear stark differences in outlook and attitudes 
                        at the table. When dining with the rich, the poor are 
                        often referred to with varying degrees of fear, condescension, 
                        and outright contempt. Unsurprisingly, conversations at 
                        the tables of the poor express an entirely predictable 
                        desire to see the heads of the rich paraded on stakes. 
                        Seldom do the two strata of society agree on anything 
                        beyond soccer. </span></p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">So, imagine my surprise to hear--again 
                        and again--expressions of optimism, hope, good feelings, 
                        and a general belief that things were going pretty well--in 
                        Colombia. In Medellin, no less, not too long ago the murder 
                        capital of the world! In expensive restaurants frequented 
                        by the well to do, the kind of people whose cars are bulletproofed, 
                        who travel with armed drivers--and later-- in what was 
                        the toughest, poorest barrio in the city, I heard the 
                        same thing. That the government seemed to be doing a pretty 
                        damn good job, that things were getting better and better, 
                        that the future looked bright--and that it was very good 
                        thing to be Colombian, and from Medellin in particular.</p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">In a world where the bad guys seem to 
                        win with a relentless regularity, and where even the presumed 
                        good guys appear, usually, to be their own worst enemies, 
                        it's really gratifying to see things get so dramatically 
                        better somewhere--especially a place where at one time, 
                        it really and truly looked hopeless. It is inspiring, 
                        when you've gotten used to the notion that some problems 
                        probably won't ever be fixed in your lifetime, to see 
                        some of the very worst kind of seemingly insurmountable 
                        problems so quickly and effectively improve. When you 
                        see a real change in the conditions and in the human hearts 
                        of a place where just a few short years ago, one neighbor 
                        couldn't walk twenty yards over without risking death 
                        from another, where drug cartels recruited their murderous 
                        young foot soldiers by the hundreds, where even the police 
                        feared to tread--it makes one hopeful again--about the 
                        whole world.</p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">Colombia. Vacation Wonderland? Yes. Absolutely. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">I can't think of another country where 
                        the No Reservations crew has been welcomed so enthusiastically 
                        everywhere we went. Absolutely everybody we met seemed 
                        delighted and proud that we'd come to point our cameras 
                        at them. And we were allowed and enabled, I should point 
                        out, to point them any damn where we pleased. Someone 
                        less...forgiving in temperament, less zen-like than me 
                        might feel tempted to point out to some other tourist 
                        boards the wisdom of letting us go and do whatever we 
                        want--no matter how uncomfortable the official organs 
                        might be about some of our interests--compared to the 
                        result when officialdom tries to "manage" what 
                        we see and don't see. . As it turned out, it was the uncontrollable 
                        elements, the poor fishermen, the inner city market workers, 
                        the residents of the neighborhood in Medellin with the 
                        very worst reputation who did their country most proud.</p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">What you might not know about Colombia 
                        is that it's beautiful. That the food is really good--with 
                        the same kind of fantastic mix of African, European and 
                        indigenous influences that makes Brazilian cuisine so 
                        interesting and vibrant. That they actually like Americans 
                        down there.</p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">It was against this backdrop of bubbly 
                        goodwill, that I watched Ingrid Betancourt and her fellow 
                        hostages freed from captivity a couple of weeks ago--in 
                        what appears to be yet another in a series of spectacular 
                        and effective strikes against the FARC, a particularly 
                        unlovely bunch of hardcore commie/narco-terrorist kidnapper/"guerillas" 
                        who've been getting knocked back on their heels in recent 
                        years.</p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">On one hand, the government seems to 
                        be killing and capturing bad guys with skill and vigor. 
                        On the other hand, the local government in Medellin (for 
                        instance) has been improving transportation and social 
                        services for the working poor--and throwing an incredible 
                        FORTY percent of total budget at education. It looks and 
                        feels like a working combination.</p>
                      <p class="Estilo2">As you watch the episode, the pride you 
                        see in the faces of the people I talk to--and hear in 
                        their voices--it's real.</p>

                        to this episode. I just watched Laos, and it was quite 
                        wonderful and beautifully done. I have learned so much 
                        about places I never knew before from watching your show, 
                        and not just about the fluff that other "travel shows" 
                        give. This isn't just tv, you are doing a great service 
                        to those who would never have had a voice before. Telling 
                        stories and sharing lives. Thank you, it has definitely 
                        opened my eyes. Oh, and my stomach as well!!<br>

                        I would not, however, &amp;%$ume that one should just 
                        randomly travel there. Doing one's homework so to speak 
                        is especially essential. Finding a guide who can reasonably

                        the subterfuge used to gain the hostages freedom. The

                        bring gifts in exchange for the meals they provide? Does 
                        the show subsidize the cost of the food? Do you offer 
                        some financial support? I appreciate the generous attitude 
                        you have when eating in other people's homes, not turning 
                        up your nose at anything these people have graciously 
                        offered you. But I've always wondered if there is something 
                        else you offer your hosts off-camera, especially the more 
                        impoverished ones!"<br>

                        Colombia for 3 years, I have found Medellin to have the 
                        nicest and most pleasant people in the world. These people 
                        deserve to have the world know that Medellin has a new 
                        image. Forget about the past Hollywood images of drug 
                        dealers. I love Medellin and i enjoy and currnently run 
                        a bed &amp; breakfast where we enjoy serving a variety 
                        of local Colombian Dishes to our visitors. The local day 
                        trips to the villages surrounding Medellin are a true 
                        GEM! Recently untouchable and dangerous war zones surrounded 
                        Medellin. Since 2005 the highways and villages became 
                        safe and wonderfull places to visit. Check out our Pueblo 
                        photos, and drop by Medellin Colombia. The local are very 
                        very friendly. http://www.MedellinApartments.INFO see

                        I wanted to say kudos to your wife! I'm sitting here watching 
                        a documentary about corporations (named "The Corporation") 
                        and Noam Chomsky has quite a prominent role in it. Rumor 
                        has it your wife is quite the student of Noam. Courageous 
                        and truthful - I like those qualities in people! </span></p>

                        @ 4:16 pm I am so moved!!! I am a television reporter 
                        from Medellin and I am so looking forward to watching 
                        the program. I want to see how someone like Anthony dares 
                        himself to go to my city, one of the most dangerous cities 
                        on the planet, according to the media, to learn the positive 
                        side of a people that, despite the social problems, due 
                        to the turmoil of war, know how to eat, cook and have 
                        fun like the kings. I admire people like Anthony who can 
                        see the good in a land that has been so hurt due to the 
                        social problems. Thinking about my country leaves a sour 
                        taste in my mouth because of the war we are still going 
                        through. But watching the promotional clips has made me 
                        remember the essence of my people!!! We still have hope 
                        and a desire to be happy!!!<br>

                        5:32 pm So, what is this about your 35-48 demographic, 
                        and not liking to drink beer on camera? (Referring to 
                        an older episode of course) But, I'm 21, my husband's 
                        31, and we both LOVE your show. My lifelong dream is to 
                        travel to just one of those places myself. even once with 
                        you would be a dream come true. (my husband would understand 
                        if I didn't come back ^^;;)Anyway, I love watching you 
                        drink beer. I was even inspired, when you went to Dublin 
                        and drank a guinness, to create a beer battered cod with 
                        hush puppies. Beer batter made with Guinness, of course! 
                        And it was exquisite! You remind me to keep my tastebuds 
                        open!<br>

                        @ 5:50 pm Anthony, As a Colombian-American I would like 
                        to thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing this 
                        episode on Medellin Colombia. I almost cried when I learned 
                        that you were doing this piece and I can’t wait 
                        to see it. Unfortunately my Country and has been the victim 
                        of violence for many years and has earned a bad reputation. 
                        Colombians are just now starting to see a ray of light 
                        at the end of a dark tunnel. I really do appreciate you 
                        showing a positive side to a beautiful country that has 
                        so much to offer! Thank you. <br>

                        @ 6:21 pm Excellent! I look forward to another excellent 
                        episode! I love that you are getting farther afield (from 
                        an American perspective)and showing us the reality of 
                        these wonderful places! I think that sometimes we believe 
                        that just because we have a free press that everything 
                        we read is true, so kudos for helping us shake off that 
                        belief by going somewhere that has been maligned so mercilessly 
                        by the American press.<br>

                        about the socio-economic divide and how it will continue 
                        to play out, considering the optimistic outlook on both 
                        sides of the fence. looking forward to the episode! oh 
                        and we've made a new game out of watching "No Reservations"... 
                        the NR drinking game entitles that we take a shot for 
                        every time we see you: a) smoke a ciggarette, b) mention 
                        a smoking reference, c) eat something hot its on! <br>

                        pm Que hubo Tony, I am really looking forward to this 
                        episode, although I rarely see a place that you don't 
                        make me want to visit. I can say I visited Colombia before 
                        you needed to show me its beauty. I have been married 
                        to a lovely Colombian lady for 15 years, but prior to 
                        that had dated quite a few Colombian girls, there are 
                        lots to choose from in Florida! I hope you didn't byp***Bogotá. 
                        It is my city of choice in Colombia, but to each their 
                        own, all the areas have their appeal. Here's a site I 
                        put together from my trip. http://www.gringoincolombia.com 
                        Well I am off to eat a big bowl of ajiaco I just made. 
                        ¡A la orden!<br>

                        excited to see how you have portraited my country. I've 
                        been waiting for this episode since I started watching 
                        your show. Colombia went through bad times as any other 
                        country in the world... but be sure that smiling has become 
                        our pleasure and our pride for the last couple fo years!<br>

                        @ 7:31 pm I think this particular trip was enhanced by 
                        the fact that you are what most people would dub as an 
                        "expert traveler". I don't think most of the 
                        "average" people would have the same experience 
                        you did. Maybe after we see the episode we can give it 
                        a try, though. If I got plopped into the middle of Columbia 
                        I would probably have a hell of a time negotiating for 
                        food and water let alone find myself a poor fisherman 
                        to show me the local cuisine. Personally I can't wait 
                        to see "The Adventures of Bourdain in the Middle 
                        East". <br>

                        @ 7:55 pm Tony, As excited as I am about the Saudi Arabia 
                        episode and the whole FAN-atic special because of my involvement 
                        in it, this is the real show I am waiting to see. What 
                        is there to say that you haven't already said in the truly 
                        heartfelt blog you just wrote about my beautiful country. 
                        Colombia is a beautiful place, however the beauty of its 
                        mountains, rivers, beaches, and flora is minimial when 
                        compared to the beauty of its people. Colombians are indeed 
                        a very proud people. In spite of the countries violent 
                        history, political struggles, and the war against drugs 
                        currently being waged with Colombia as ground zero, Colombians 
                        are people with a great sense of humor that love to drink, 
                        party, eat and are always smiling. You saw a Colombia 
                        that has really always been there, only that people rarely 
                        ever gave it a shot. Some still don't. Travel shows never 
                        went to Colombia when I was growing up. International 
                        news stations that did the world weather report would 
                        always talk about the weather all over South America, 
                        yet not one city in Colombia was ever mentioned. It was 
                        like we didn't exist. Everyone just too scared to look 
                        into our corner of the world. My family has sent texts, 
                        e-mails, and made phone calls to relatives all over the 
                        U.S., Colombia, and Europe. They all know about the show 
                        on Monday. DVR's and TiVo's are set to record Monday at 
                        10:00 pm. It's just exciting to, for once, see a show 
                        on television about Colombia that isn't about the FARC, 
                        ELN, Paramilitaries, or Pablo Escobar. It's exciting to 
                        for once see a show about US! What we eat, what we do, 
                        how we live, and how we party. Colombia, is the new South 
                        American hot spot. Great food, beautiful women, andawesome 
                        places to visit. Medellin and Cartagena are great, but 
                        If you ever decide to do a show in the capital city of 
                        Bogota, hit me up! "Tomemonos un tinto y seamos amigos!"

                        in Medellín back when I was a kid, while playing 
                        soccer, running under someone's porch with the other 10-15 
                        kids and waiting out the rain. The owners of the house 
                        opened the door and offered buñuelos and almojábanas 
                        with CocaCola to the entire group of kids seeking refuge 
                        on their porch. That is Medellín, and it and it's 
                        people are beautiful. Thank you for your kind and thoughtful

                        @ 8:33 pm I'm very excited about monday's show! I've already 
                        told a number of my friends and family about it. I'm happy 
                        that the travel channel, especially your show, has taken

                        11:26 pm Tony We love your show, and enjoyed reading Kitchen 
                        Confidential recently. I spent a few years dish-dogging 
                        in a kitchen, and I loved the backstage drama of "the 
                        house of knives". So I really related to your book. 
                        Your descriptions of latex gloves and p&amp;%$ing the 
                        turkey at thanksgiving put me on the floor with laughter. 
                        Your recent Laos epsiode has haunted me somewhat as a 
                        new American Citizen. What is the American government 
                        doing to help with the clean up of a country they so carelessly 
                        bombed? The scene at dinner with the man who lost his 
                        arm and leg is very moving, how ashamed of America you 
                        must have felt. Have you ever thought of using a Travel 
                        Channel website to raise funds/&amp;%$istance for some 
                        of these diasadvantaged folks? <br>

                        to Colombia and not matter who you are or where you are 
                        from you will feel like at home......<br>

                        an episode on my home country I was excited! I totally 
                        can't wait to watch it...unfortunately i will be at work 
                        but i am definitely putting on the travel channel on at 
                        10pm on our flat screen at the sushi bar at work! There 
                        is no way i am missing this episode! This is one i can 
                        share with the rest of my family so they can see why i 
                        enjoy watching you so much, not only because i am an aspiring 
                        chef, but so that they can see what drives us chefs to 
                        continue working in this disfunctional industry and especially 
                        because you are in our home country. i would have never 
                        thought Colombia was a territory where an American program 
                        would set foot on. Medellin was "THE RIGHT" 
                        choice only because of its beauty and hospitality alone, 
                        the food is just a bonus! <br>

                        12 2008 @ 2:54 am I recently heard about Mr. Antonio Bourdain 
                        famous show going to Colombia, and I said to myself, self 
                        am I dreaming? And i guess, I wasn't dreaming at all. 
                        My mom and a couple of friends called me up to confirm 
                        the No Reservations(Colombia). I am thrilled! This is 
                        such an event! I never expected the Travel Channel or 
                        any other U.S. network down in Medellin, but I was wrong. 
                        Mr. Bourdain, thank you so much for coming down to Colombia 
                        and thank you for showing your U.S. audience, what colombians 
                        are made of and what to expect of them when they go down 
                        there and visit. Well, I only hope Samantha Brown is taking 
                        notes, cause I love to see her down in Medellin during 
                        the Flower fair in August, and to show her and many others, 
                        that Colombia is NOT the Kidnaping capital of the world.

                        spell Colombia. Throughout the 90's I spent much time 
                        working in Colombia - it is indeed a very beautiful country 
                        with proud, friendly people! I'm sure it has only gotten

                        I was touched to see the promo commercial for this weeks 
                        episode. Hearing the cumbia beats through the commercial 
                        and reading your kind words on this blog made me teary 
                        eyed. We Colombians are immensely proud of our country 
                        and to share the true beauty of our nation with the world 
                        brings me real joy. Thank you guys for visiting and hope 
                        you go back again (maybe Cali next time) P.s. Miami has 
                        a lot of wonderful Colombian restaurants and bakeries

                        - July 12 2008 @ 3:11 pm Hi Tony, I'm glad you are back 
                        blogging. I have always enjoyed your unique writing style, 
                        and watching all of your shows and hearing your voice 
                        makes it come alive even more. Purposefully or not, you 
                        are also becoming a unique type of amb&amp;%$ador. Thank 
                        you for showing us so much of the world, and for representing 
                        us in such a wonderful way. Your response to the man in 
                        Laos who lost his limbs was thoughtful, respectful and 
                        beautiful.<br>

                        VISIT. THE FOOD IS BEYOND DELICIOUS BUT IT IS BY ALL MEANS 
                        A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE!!HANDS DOWN!!!ESPECIALLY FOR AMERICANS. 
                        MY MOM IS MARRIED TO A COLUMBIAN AND I HAVE VISITED A 
                        FEW TIMES.AND IT WAS A CULTURE SHOCK FOR ME. YOUR EITHER

                        DOESNT GIVE A DAM ABOUT YOU. IT COULD BE A VERY NICE PLACE

                        @ 5:44 pm Wow, Anthony I have to say that you really are 
                        one of my heroes. I admire anyone who welcomes diversity 
                        so much as well as breeding tolerance. I might just be 
                        16, but I think thats really what the world needs especially 
                        today. Anywho, when I saw the comemrcial that you were 
                        going to Colombia, i was so extremly excited, you've been 
                        overdue for this trip. As a Colombian, i am proud to say 
                        that our food is so diverse and and amazing. I loved how 
                        on your post you talked about what makes colombia great 
                        and the fact that our country is changing and for the 
                        better. And to all of those that think that its too dangerous, 
                        thats not true, you just have to know which areas to avoid, 
                        otheriwse its safe, that is unless you walk downtown with 
                        a big 24 carrat necklace or something. Thanks Anthony, 
                        I'm sure this is going to be myfavorite episode! =)<br>

                        ask you if you would ever consider going to Colombia. 
                        My shyness overcame me and instead we posed for a picture 
                        as if you were reading to me. I can't wait to see this

                        my hometown of Medellin, i have been waiting to watch 
                        an episode about Colombia, i think Tony is the right person 
                        to show our beautiful city, he shows the real thing unlike 
                        most of the other TV shows that only show places where 
                        only rich people can afford them.<br>

                        @ 7:24 pm As a Colombian-American from Medellin, I am 
                        so excited about this episode. I haven't been there in 
                        many years so I'm really looking forward to it. Despite 
                        the reputation &amp; stereotypes that the Colombian people 
                        have, we're actually also known as some of the friendliest 
                        &amp; most hospitable people and it seems that your show 
                        will prove that. Colombia itself gets a bad rap because 
                        that's all the media will showcase so THANK YOU for letting 
                        the US viewers see the Colombia we know &amp; love.<br>

                        (made without bouillon cubes!), fresh almojabanas or morcilla 
                        and drink guaro de antioqueno I will have lost all respect. 
                        When you come back drop me a line - I know a great bar 
                        in El Hueco with the greatest local atmosphere and you 
                        can come to my aunt's in Manrique and do one of her famous 
                        roof top barbecues with the best views and music. You 
                        can eat all the things you missed the first time- that 
                        is if you missed anything - on second thought you pretty 
                        much eat and drink everything, so who's kidding who? <br>

                        July 13 2008 @ 12:21 am I can hardly wait for your show 
                        about Colombia. I was born in Barranquilla, and haven't 
                        been back home for over 11 years. All I hear about Colombia 
                        is bad stuff. Most Americans believe that anyone who was 
                        born there is related to "The Cartel", and sells 
                        drugs here....very sad to get that from people all the 
                        time, but I am happy to know that, thanks to your show, 
                        the image of such wonderful country is on its way to a 
                        better reflection on what life really is there. Looking 
                        forward to Monday. TD.<br>

                        @ 2:31 am Watching Travel Channel is one of those times 
                        when there's nothing else interesting to watch on TV. 
                        But the first Time I saw No Reservations, I got hook up 
                        right away, it's quite interesting enough to see different 
                        ways many cultures portrayed local (real) people around 
                        food. I'm really touched watching your show and your realistic 
                        comments while sharing a humble meal with a man with a 
                        broken limb and his family in Laos. This tiem, I've taken 
                        your show seriously and I cannot wait to watch the Colombian 
                        episode. Tony - you can really deliver your show to us 
                        in such a real way, no pretensions, no commercial hype, 
                        indeed no reservations. Now it has become one of my favorite 
                        TV shows. <br>

                        @ 2:44 am I was lucky enough to spend two weeks last year 
                        in Bogota and nearby areas. LOVED IT! Loved the people, 
                        the food, the music, the parties, the shopping, the weather, 
                        the museums, the funny little cars and mobs of traffic. 
                        Loved shopping in a huge area that was all Christmas decorations, 
                        than an entire area of leather goods. Tony - go to Bogota 
                        and eat a "barrito" a large beautiful delicious 
                        fish. Everyone seems delighted to see Americans and want 
                        to talk with us, thank us for coming and tell us why we 
                        are important to them.<br>

                        7:13 am Thank you so much for giving Colombia a chance 
                        to be seen with different eyes. Unfortunately, people 
                        only relates the country with violence, drugs and guerrilla 
                        and it's wonderful for once to get to know the real people, 
                        flavors and colors of such beautiful country :) <br>

                        Colombia brake down stereotypes and teach the world what 
                        Colombia really is about-I can't wait to watch the show 
                        on Monday night, for me is Cali that has the most special 
                        place in my heart.The heat,music, macetas, empanadas, 
                        champus de Lola, chontaduro, mango viche, grocellas, pandebono, 
                        and festive air of Cali are nothing else.<br>

                        2008 @ 11:31 am Good for you, Mr. Bourdain for doing a 
                        show in Medellin, Colombia. I'm Colombian myself, although 
                        I've lived in the US since I was 3 1/2. Do I love Colombia? 
                        Yes. Is it the best country in the world? No. It has tons 
                        of social issues to contend with before there's hope in 
                        the horizon. I hate to say it, but this country has given 
                        me more opportunities that Colombia would've given me. 
                        It is a nice country, not beautiful, but nice, however 
                        the differences between the cl&amp;%$es, and the horrible 
                        treatment the poor receive from the rich, is going to 
                        keep Colombia down of something isn't done about that 
                        problem soon. Again, thanks for doingn a show in my country.

                        3:58 pm I'm always frustrated at how depressingly little 
                        press this great show gets. Not one mention of the season 
                        premiere in Entertainment Weekly, or any other trade journal 
                        that I can see. No website publicity. Either the media 
                        thinks it's too "small" a show to be worthy 
                        of their time, or Travel Channel does a terrible job of 
                        promoting their most popular show. I remember Tony on 
                        Letterman...TWO MONTHS AGO...in between season. Come on, 
                        Travel Channel, you have a gem here. You should be doing 
                        more to get it beyond its faithful viewers. This show 
                        really deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. 
                        Not only is it good, it's good for you.<br>

                        @ 5:23 pm Thank you, thank you, thank you Mr. Anthony 
                        Bourdain for showing a very different side of ColOmbia 
                        (for those of you who keep misspelling it as Columbia), 
                        that actually -gasp- has ALWAYS existed. The side of the 
                        hard working, intelligent, driven people that despite 
                        life's afflictions remain resilient and with their heads 
                        high. This is why I love you and your show (and everyone 
                        who makes it happen), you don't sugar coat anything but 
                        you are so open-minded that you would visit a country 
                        such as Colombia, which has infinitely been portrayed 
                        in the media in such a way that it is hard to not &amp;%$ociate 
                        it with negative connotations. Not saying that the bad 
                        side isn't a part of it, but what place doesn't have its 
                        bad AND good side?! Growing up in NY, I could seldom mention 
                        my heritage without being asked "So what cartel do 
                        you belong to". Frustrating when everyone in your 
                        family has broken their backs to make an honest living. 
                        With everything that is happening there now, politically 
                        and economically, I pray that this is a new era for this 
                        country that has been through so much. Anderson Cooper 
                        was there recently and also had a positive experience. 
                        Individuals like you, that share a different perspective 
                        on a people, definitely contribute to a positive change. 
                        Once again, kudos to you and your team and I wish you 
                        all much continued success for many years to come. Hope 
                        you can one day visit Medellin in its Christmas splendor 
                        and its Feria de las Flores. It's unforgettable! PS Could 
                        you please include explanations for the pictures you post 
                        on your facebook page? It would be great to know where 
                        they were taken and if food is in them what it is you 
                        are feasting on. Thanks!! =]<br>

                        Ospina - July 13 2008 @ 7:08 pm Hola! We are two cousins 
                        from Texas, who were born in America from Colombian parents, 
                        both from Medellin. We both have been traveling there 
                        for over 25 years. Our families consist of both rich and 
                        poor in Colombia. And they have both treated us with nothing 
                        but love and respect. It is true to say that Colombians 
                        are the sweetest and most out going. From a family dinner 
                        to RUMBA in the Barrio. From an arepa con frijoles y arroz 
                        to una MARENADA (ROAST OF A PIG). While visiting at least 
                        once a year and then having to return, it hurts like hell. 
                        What we would give to have the best of both worlds. We 
                        are so exciting to see your show and we thank you for 
                        going and showing the world what Colombia really is. Reading 
                        the comments and your blog, we pray that Colombia is advancing 
                        as the country America should always have talked about 
                        it. We can talk about our experiences and show pictures, 
                        but we cant compare to what you can show them. THANKS 
                        A MILLION TIMES. Viva COLOMBIA!<br>

                        @ 9:30 pm Thank you for always looking at all countris 
                        in a positive way. I was in Colombia a couple of years 
                        ago on business (Cartagena de Indias) - beautiful and 
                        the best meat I've ever had - better than Argentina......YES! 
                        The best service I've received in any hotel - similar 
                        to Buenos Aires but not as snooty. Never had a bad meal 
                        except for one vintage street food sausage (my bad, should've 
                        known better). And wonderful Arabic food, to boot. Can't 
                        wait to see the episode.. Gracias, Tony, baby!! Anne<br>

                        A country full of friendly people, good food, and gorgeous 
                        women. Some info: Have you wondered why Colombia is an 
                        strategic allied of US in south America? Read why: Colombia 
                        is a standing middle power with the second largest Spanish-speaking 
                        population in the world after Mexico. It also has the 
                        third-largest population in Latin America after Brazil 
                        and Mexico. Colombia is the 26th largest nation in the 
                        world and the fourth-largest in South America (after Brazil, 
                        Argentina, and Peru), with an area more than twice that 
                        of France. Population: April 2008 estimate 44,087,000

                        13 2008 @ 10:49 pm Anthony, Thanks for doing a show on 
                        Colombia, and especially on Medellin. I travel to Colombia 
                        often for business and find it to be the most fascinating 
                        country in Latin America. Great people! Enchanting and 
                        incredible places to visit. The Coffee Region is incredibly 
                        beautiful. And an economy that continues to grow despite 
                        the internal problems. Thanks to President Uribe, almost 
                        all the country is open to tourism...Colombia is SOON 
                        TO BE DISCOVERED AS A PARADISE for tourism. Wonderful 
                        people, incredible geography, fabulous beaches, good food, 
                        all at reasonable prices. May I strongly suggest a show 
                        on the Colombian Coffee Region! YOU WILL WANT TO STAY 
                        THERE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE...INCREDIBLE!!!!!<br>

                        am Thank you so much for doing this show. I haven't even 
                        watched it yet and I can hardly contain my excitement. 
                        I was born in Medellin but came to the US when I was 2. 
                        Although I consider the US my home I still have a great 
                        love and pride for my native country. I married an American 
                        and he has great reservations about Colombia. I can't 
                        blame him for thinking that if he visits one day he will 
                        be shot or kidnapped because that is all he knows. My 
                        dream is to one day take him there so he too can see the 
                        real beauty of Colombia. Many blessings Ana<br>

                        2008 @ 8:29 am Tony, I can't wait to see tonight's Colombia 
                        episode. I have heard and read many things about how beautiful 
                        it is and how nice the people are. I vacation often in 
                        Latin america because the prices there are still very 
                        reasonable compared to Euro country based vacation. I 
                        want to visit Colombia, but my wife has concerns that 
                        Pablo Escobar might still be alive.:) I do hope that your 
                        show dispels some the old stereotypes.</p>

                        love about your show, you show life from both ends and 
                        give the "real" people of a country the respect 
                        they deserve. Looking forward to this espisode just as 
                        much as the others. My eldest son, Zack, has decided you 
                        are one of his heroes even though he hates to cook but 
                        he is hoping to be a Political Journalist and his greatest 
                        desire is to be like you. lol<br>

                        10:34 am I am really looking forward to this episode on 
                        your trip to Columbia! My very best friend back in grade 
                        school moved to the States from Columbia and I learned 
                        so much about the language, food and culture from her 
                        and her family. Can I ask you...did you eat a special 
                        fruit called a mamancillo while you were there? They were 
                        my favorite! I have not been able to find them in the 
                        US since high school. Her mom was the best cook and made 
                        a fabulous arroz con pollo and hand formed corn tortillas 
                        that she sort of grilled on a cookie cooling rack over 
                        the burner on her stove and filled with melted butter 
                        and cheese. We ate them for breakfast and were they ever 
                        good!! Obviously I cannot wait for this episode!!<br>

                        10:47 am More than 25 years ago I travelled to Cartegena 
                        every February. It was warm, beautiful and the food and 
                        people were marvelous! Despite the pirates in those days 
                        and the armed guards by the pool, it was still a lovely 
                        place to visit. In fact,to this day I can still taste 
                        the vegetables -- the best I've ever had. Even now I can 
                        taste the richness of the soil. It's great to see someone 
                        capture all that.<br>

                        @ 11:17 am Colombia is probably the friendliest country 
                        for americans. Whether you visit Bogota, Cartagena or 
                        Medellin you will not have any problems. In fact, based 
                        on the latest statistics you are more likely to get killed 
                        in Washington DC than in any of these cities. My recommendation: 
                        if you are worried about social security, invest for the 
                        future and buy an inexpensive luxury condo and plan to 
                        retire there eating all the good food.<br>

                        11:27 am Tony, Thank you for Showing my amazing country. 
                        I was born in Medellin Colombia and my husband is American. 
                        We have been on vacations around the world but have not 
                        been in Colombia. We have been hearing how the country 
                        has been improving. Tonight will be the first time my 
                        husband will see a positive experience about this great 
                        culture that welcomes everyone. Now that we are expecting 
                        our first baby, I am greatful for this show because I 
                        know we will be confident to visit colombia with our future 
                        kids. Gracias Tony &amp; Viva Colombia Pues. <br>

                        11:34 am Finally, No Reservations in Colombia! What a 
                        great opportunity to show people all over the world the 
                        reason why Colombia is one of the happiest countries on 
                        Earth! Even in times of war or difficulties is the love 
                        for our country that gives us the strenght to not give 
                        up! I hope everybody gets to see the real Colombia, that 
                        we are friendly people, that we have awesome food and 
                        amazing landscapes. Hopefully the show will change the 
                        perception people have about Colombia and realize how 
                        beautiful it is!<br>

                        am Can't wait to watch this episode. I would never have 
                        considered traveling to Colombia, until I married a Colombian-American 
                        girl. Now I've been twice. It really is an amazing country. 
                        The landscapes are as beautiful as the poorest areas are 
                        unsettling. But the people are unfailingly friendly and 
                        the food is great. Then there's the agua ardiente! It 
                        seems the country is "getting there" in terms 
                        of being a destination for novice travelers. I hope more 
                        gringos choose to go so the misconceptions we have here 
                        can be shattered. Thanks to shows like this I think that 
                        can happen soon enough.<br>

                        11:46 am Tony: Looking forward to your trip to Colombia 
                        tonight. One of my daughters in law is Colombian-American 
                        (mother from Barranquilla &amp; two sisters). I'm sure 
                        she will love to watch your trip and see her heritage. 
                        Certainly Colombia is a beautiful country that I would 
                        like to visit some day, especially now that the social 
                        situation is changing for the best. Thanks Tony for your 
                        great programs, I'm a great fan and I don't miss one! 
                        Also I finished Kitchen Confidential and I'm on my second 
                        book A Cook's Tour. Congratulations on your success! Keep 
                        up the good work, through you we can travel the world!

                        @ 12:34 pm Anthony Thank you for not paying attention 
                        to the rumors of the Most Dangerous country in the world 
                        to go. As always the media doesn't help and just do the 
                        blah blah without really knowing the people or in this 
                        case the real Colombia, my country. As every country in 
                        the world, we have economical and social problems and 
                        I don't think America is free of them either. This is 
                        a great opportunity to show people all over the world 
                        why even with problems we are happy and friendly people. 
                        I am counting the hours to see this special tonight. Thank 
                        you from the bottom of my heart. OLGA LUCIA FROM CALIFORNIA

                        doesn't have guerillas all over the place. I have lived 
                        there for the last two out of three years. It is a very 
                        safe country. You just can't be an idiot and wander into 
                        the wrong places, just like in the US. Please don't spread 
                        your rumors and unresearched opinions.<br>

                        throught the entire country and my safety was the last 
                        of my concerns. It is one of a few undiscovered gems in 
                        the world. If you plan to see it without the crowds then 
                        you better hurry, word is spreading fast that it is AMAZING!!. 
                        For incredible fresh seafood, go to Parque Tayrona and 
                        spend a few nights sleeping next to the beach in a hammack.

                        1 hour from Cartagena, i'm really looking forward to this 
                        episode of my beautiful country, thanks No reservations 
                        for showing the world the real side of our country, one 
                        that people don't know, i think that the North americans 
                        will learn a lot and gain a new perspective form this 
                        episode. Also if you want to know a little more about

                        The guerrillas are not everywhere, this is why bad rumors 
                        spread quickly and people are afraid of traveling. Stay 
                        away from Colombia, idiots like you are not welcome!<br>

                        colombia or to insult the people that does so... In my 
                        opinion Corrina has her facts a little wrong, in Colombia 
                        there are not guerrillas everywhere holding AK47's, you 
                        have visted here yes, but i lived here 31 years and traveled 
                        around the country several times, and can tell for a fact 
                        that what you say isn't accurate at all<br>

                        definitely has piqued my curiosity. Like many in the United 
                        States, I remember the stereotypes of the drug-lords and 
                        crime-ridden government. I would very much like to see 
                        more of this and am looking forward to the episode. It 
                        would be interesting to hear your take on speaking local 
                        languages. My only experience with non-English is, sadly, 
                        fluency in a dead language: Latin. (Yay, History degree!) 
                        Traveling to Brazil, Columbia, or Peru definitely appeals 
                        to me but I hesitate when I think about the language barrier 
                        and not having a translator with me as you do on your 
                        explorations. Perhaps on future shows you could address 
                        the role language plays in visiting another nation. Yours, 
                        Sylvan (Dave)<br>

                        2008 @ 6:14 pm Colombia is the best place of the World! 
                        and Colombia is the country for the people who want to 
                        take the risk... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgW8Y7F8DN8 
                        I am so proud of be colombian!<br>

                        @ 6:25 pm Hey Tony, I'm leaving for the Middle East in 
                        a month. I'll be spending 12 days touring Israel for free 
                        (it's great being one of the chosen people). All kidding 
                        aside, after that I'm going to Egypt for a week. I wanted 
                        to know when your 'No Reservation' on Cairo is going to 
                        air so we can get some ideas on where to go. My girlfriend 
                        is going to travel with me and then she plans on going 
                        to Travel Channel's School. It's been her p&amp;%$ion 
                        to work in the travel industry and after this trip she 
                        would have stepped foot on every continent except Antartica, 
                        pretty good for a 24 year old! Anyway you've become my 
                        new found hero and I hope one day we could compare experiences 
                        from around the world. <br>

                        The people, the food, the weather... just awesome<br>

                        pm Tony, What a great country it is, though still troubled. 
                        We traveled there in 2005, lived in hotels, fincas and 
                        private homes. Like you say, we were treated like kings...restaurant 
                        owners and hotel managers would visit our tables or give 
                        us little gifts on our departure, and always it was "Thank 
                        you for visiting Colombia" or in one or two cases, 
                        "thank you for taking a chance on Colombia." 
                        And the food, from humblest to gourmet, was phenomenal. 
                        I had the five best bowls of soup in my life there, at 
                        five different places. And the talapia rojas (hope I'm 
                        close to the right spelling), caught that morning and 
                        served at noon...jeez, I'm going back! Thanks for taking 
                        a chance on Colombia...I hope other people do. Jim<br>

                        @ 8:07 pm You need not go to Medellin or even COlombia 
                        for the real paisa food. Go to Jackson Heights, Queens, 
                        New York. Tierras Colombianas. Have the Sancocho de Gallina. 
                        Arepas. Go to Chuzos Enjoy. </p>

                        Buckley - July 14 2008 @ 8:10 pm Tony, My husband and 
                        I were very fortunate to visit Bogata over Columbus weekend 
                        in 1973 before the drug lords took over that beautiful 
                        capitol. The architecture was unbelievable and the people 
                        very beautiful. Did you know that many are of IrishSpanish 
                        heritage? Saw the best dressed beautiful women as well 
                        as the begging poor. A country of contrasts. Got to the 
                        Salt Cathedral, incredible! Would love to get back to 
                        see the rest of the country someday in my lifetime! Looking 
                        forward to the episode tonight as well as the rest of 
                        yours! P.S. My husband thinks you have the greatest sense 
                        of humor! :)<br>

                        @ 8:25 pm I was delighted to hear that you decided to 
                        go to Colombia! It is a beautiful country with amazing 
                        food and the most amazing people that you will ever meet. 
                        They are always hopeful and always there to lend a hand. 
                        I am happy that you and your crew can show what Colombia 
                        is really like, beautiful and a great tourist spot (if 
                        you go to Medellin or Bogota or anywhere else in Colombia).<br>

                        14 2008 @ 8:37 pm Thanks for visiting Colombia, especially 
                        my hometown of Medellin. They need all the positive pulbicity 
                        that they can get. This will do more to bring tourists 
                        to this country and city and reverse the perception that 
                        most Americans have about Colombia. Colombia is changing 
                        for the right reasons and it is really the paradise of 
                        "spring". Keep up the good job wih your show 
                        to bring the real world back to the U.S.<br>

                        @ 9:30 pm First of all, I am your biggest fan. Bar none.. 
                        I work from home and watch reruns over and over again 
                        and never tire of them. I am fascinated with food and 
                        different cultures. I was in Tibet and China this last 
                        fall and that trip changed who I am for the better.. Anyway.. 
                        I am really looking forward to this episode tonight. There 
                        has been this vision of the seedy side of Columbia and 
                        this sounds like it's going to set things 'right'. Allen<br>

                        14 2008 @ 11:52 pm Chef, Colombia seems to be flourishing 
                        beyond all Yankee conceptions...which leads me to wonder 
                        perhaps Bigfoot needs to open a place in Medellin and 
                        maybe the crazy bread guy could learn how to make Chorizo 
                        too. But seriously an outstanding job as always. Thank 
                        you for providing some measure of relief from the unyielding 
                        drivel on those other networks.<br>

                        lived there during my high school years but it was enough 
                        to learn about it's awesome culture and people. Thank

                        instead you crudely showed how our food, and most important

                        @ 12:07 am Dear Mr. Bourdain, I am watching your show 
                        on Colombia as I write this blog and wanted to thank you 
                        sooo much fro showing what Colombia and its people are 
                        really like and not what it has been made out to be. Thank 
                        you for showing what a happy country and how rich in culture 
                        and beauty it is. THANK YOU. <br>

                        touched with the emotional show about Colombia you showed 
                        us tonight. It was beautiful and truthful. Thank you for 
                        showing us the real face of such a great country... Que 
                        viva Colombia! <br>

                        finnaly dared to give Colombia a chance. Thank you so 
                        much for showing people how beautiful my country really 
                        is and how much we've progressed. THANK YOU. I'm excited 
                        for this episode, and i hope it changes peoples views 
                        and at least give it a chance one day. We're proud welcoming

                        2008 @ 12:20 am Tony.... Echoing the previous comments.....THANK 
                        YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!! It is not too often that someone, 
                        let alone the host of a renowned TV program, is willing 
                        to go out to Colombia and report on the reality of the 
                        country and its people. Being from Medellin myself, its 
                        great to see the reality of my city being shown in all 
                        of its sides..not just the bad and the ugly. Colombia 
                        has tons of things (good ones) to offer its visitors. 
                        I find that you managed to capture the optimism and hope 
                        that now permeates the people living in Colombia, in addition 
                        to showcasing the great variety of foods that are there. 
                        Once again...thank you. I am a huge follower of your show, 
                        and needless to say, I watched this one with particular 
                        interest. Hope you had fun and that your visit was everything 
                        you hoped it would be.<br>

                        @ 12:23 am Tony, Im back, yes, commenting yet again. But 
                        in this one I just have to. It's Colombia, my country. 
                        I loved the way you and ZPZ put this one together. The 
                        show is incredibly upbeat, proud, and truly shows the 
                        essence of the Colombian people. You could clearly see 
                        the hope, the happiness, and the enthusiasm of Colombians, 
                        from every social status, as they look towards what is 
                        clearly a more promising future. My girlfriend, an uber 
                        proud, ultra patriotic, yellow, blue, and red flag waving 
                        Colombian was so excited by your show she made sure her 
                        family and friends, some barely spaeaking English, watch 
                        your show. Both her and I, pausing the live show in order 
                        to provide simultaneous translation. Your show made us 
                        all proud. Colombia at its best, most beautiful, and most 
                        humble. The face of the real people, the people that a 
                        couple of years ago were being silenced by violent and 
                        bloody conflict. We can now smile, dance, and celebrate 
                        because the one thing we have been praying for (for over 
                        60 years) is finally within reach...PEACE. Thank you ZPZ 
                        and Tony Bourdain. Eric "ThaiBoxer" Rivera<br>

                        @ 12:29 am Anthony, Thank you so much for doing this episode! 
                        My parents are from Colombia and Iran, two countries that 
                        the media tends to focus on the negative aspects of, something 
                        that has always made me very sad. I'm so glad that you 
                        have focused on the beautiful people, places and wonderful 
                        in Colombia! Next time you go to Colombia, make sure you 
                        stop in Bogota and try some Ajiaco ;)!!!<br>

                        12:29 am Mil Gracias Tony... As a Colombian-American, 
                        it is with shows like yours that the mentality of travelers 
                        will be changed and when they are looking for an exicting, 
                        vibrant, and new destination - they will choose to visit 
                        our Colombia. From its beaches to the mountain cities 
                        like Medellin and Bogota - to the warm of people in Cali 
                        - turist should come to see why this South American country 
                        has so much to offer. Mil Gracias, Luca<br>

                        2008 @ 12:29 am Thanks chef for the segment on Colombia. 
                        I remenece on my childhood, my culture, my food and the 
                        country that gave me birth. t. Colombia is a rich country 
                        in natural resources but the people is what makes the 
                        country shine....<br>

                        made it magical .....( really refreshing as we have seen 
                        so little of positive stories on what is going on down 
                        there...) I love that you weave the soul of the people 
                        with the people....you show is truly my Monday Night Soulfood....thank 
                        you..<br>

                        12:34 am Mr. Bourdain -- Thank you. My two young sons 
                        are native Colombians. The constant negative American 
                        media stereotypes don't do this beautiful country justice. 
                        You have finally broken the myth! Your show put the exclamation 
                        point on what I've been trying to explain for years: that 
                        Colombia is a vibrant country full of hope for the future. 
                        During my visits to Colombia, the people were universally 
                        optimistic and enthusiastic about the future of their 
                        country. No Reservations is always a favorite of mine 
                        (and my boys!), but this hit a home run. You finally dug 
                        deeper and showed the viewing public the Real Colombia. 
                        Again, thank you. Well done. <br>

                        @ 12:38 am Mr. Anthony Bourdain, i just finished watching 
                        the Colombian episode, and im soo happy to know that you 
                        went to my home country and had so many nice things to 
                        say. Colombia is a wonderful place and now through your 
                        show many people are going to change their minds about 
                        it. i only hope that you would be back and visit cali 
                        (my hometown). Also, just to let you know we never miss 
                        your show, and baton rouge, la loves you! :D geaux tigers! 
                        ps: come visit Baton Rouge!!! <br>

                        12:40 am After his rescue, Marc Gonzales pointed out the 
                        continued suffering of the 700 or more hostages being 
                        held in Columbia.. "In this exact moment right now, 
                        they are being punished because we got rescued successfully." 
                        According to El Pais newspaper, 11 days ago a Canadian 
                        was intercepted by a group of strangers, and was taken 
                        to mountains under FARC control. The new Vacation Wonderland 
                        portrayed in the episode contrasts sharply with the reality 
                        being faced by hundreds of captives.</p>

                        enjoy the show. Love experiencing the food and culture 
                        through your eyes- know you'd probably hate the smiley 
                        face as much as I do, so I won't do it, but I do appreciate 
                        what you do for everyone- the people who watch and the 
                        people you visit. But I have not the time nor the budget 
                        to do it, so I watch your show- I'll get there some day- 
                        watch out! You do good (says the teacher...) <br>

                        @ 12:55 am I've missed you, Bourdain. I've been too busy, 
                        too tired or too bored to get engaged in any episode or 
                        the quarterly blog entry. But Columbia! What a journey. 
                        So after that and a few re-runs I had to check back in. 
                        The Cult of Bourdain appears to be doing fine and even 
                        if you seem a bit more tame (due to that pesky editing, 
                        I'm sure) I'd bet there is enough kitchen cowboy left 
                        in you to stir things up when you choose. Sometime back 
                        the Boy had decided to pursue the high profile, ever in 
                        the spotlight position of grill cook..in hopes of taking 
                        one step towards his goal of becoming a chef. One month 
                        in the kitchen and he decided it wasn't for him; something 
                        about the pain in his feet and the smell that clung to 
                        him so tenaciously. I had counseled him to watch No Reservations 
                        for inspiration...thank goodness the new season is here, 
                        hopefully in time to prevent him from pursuing a career 
                        in skateboarding.<br>

                        15 2008 @ 1:00 am I just finished watching the premiere 
                        of your episode on Colombia. While you are generally correct, 
                        most Colombians do not drink as much Aguardiente as you 
                        do ! Granted, it was your working vacation so an exception 
                        is allowed. I am a "Norte Americano" married 
                        to a "Bogotana". I have known this astoundingly 
                        beautiful country since 1992. I have lived in Bogota for 
                        two years during 2005-6. A 60 minute program does not 
                        do a country as diverse and beautiful as Colombia justice. 
                        I do applaud you for shedding an optimistic and non prejudiced 
                        light upon an extraordinarily beautiful culture. You have 
                        portrayed Colombia as simply a 3rd world country though 
                        I understand your limited time to present. I do hope you 
                        will present more on other aspects of the country, particularly 
                        Bogota which I know you visited in 2007. ( I chose not 
                        to pay the $85 per ticket to hear your talk) Throughout 
                        my worldwide travels, I have not met more friendly people 
                        than Colombians. I understand this was your observation, 
                        in so many words, as well. I hope and encourage you to 
                        visit again and present more about Colombia once again. 
                        Thank you for being amongst the first Americans to present 
                        the positive about Colombia.<br>

                        I had been waiting the Colombia episode impatiently since 
                        I read a brief note about it in El Colombiano. I've always 
                        liked how Bourdain has countered many stereotypes and 
                        fears that many hold (and I include myself) against the 
                        places he visits. <br>

                        family is from the La Paz neighborhood, I was delighted 
                        to see a show that broke from the common theme and confronted 
                        the prejudice that is not only held around the world against 
                        Colombia, but also within Colombia against Medellín 
                        and within wealthier Medellín residents against 
                        their neighbors in the northern neighborhoods. <br>
                        Some of the shots taken at Brasa Arepa in Envigado caught 
                        views of the house where my father grew up and once owned 
                        a hardware store - the one with the red tiles across the 
                        street, seen when Bourdain was in focus. This episode 
                        brought back many memories - I can´t wait the two 
                        weeks that I have left before I visit in August, just 
                        in time for the Flower Festival. And no, it is not about 
                        hippies - nothing against them though - think of it as 
                        a celebration of Antioquia´s culture. <br>
                        Bourdain and staff - Keep up the great work, Jaime Soto 
                        <br>

                        15 2008 @ 1:02 am My husband and I really enjoy watching 
                        your show, we get inspired to continue traveling and being 
                        open minded when we do. We love going to the markets as 
                        you do. We have also recruited new fans for "No Reservations" 
                        because we find talking ourselves referring to your show 
                        all the time! thanks! Cynthia p.s. does your wife ever 
                        get to go on any of these trips?<br>

                        1:04 am Thanks Tony. A few months ago I posted on a No 
                        Reservations group in Facebook that you should go to Colombia, 
                        and eat in Cartagena at the places you showed. And it 
                        seemed like you read my message. Thanks for showing Colombia, 
                        but more than anything, thanks for showing the real face 
                        of Colombia. Neither the one that we read about on the 
                        newspapers (guerrilla, kidnapping, etc) nor the rich side 
                        of Colombia (Skylines, luxury living, etc), but the real 
                        one and the people that makes the country. The people 
                        that get up every morning to go to work and that don't 
                        appear no T.V Shows. Once more time, thank you.<br>

                        1:05 am I am watching the show on columbia, I could just 
                        lose myself in the market. intoxicated by all the visually 
                        appealing fresh meats and vegetables. i wouldnt be able 
                        to control myself from buying ingredients to concoct my 
                        own columbian stew of warm comfort. i love the columbian 
                        culture as much as i am in love with all of the beautifull 
                        cultures around the world. so many times we lose were 
                        we came from and how we are americanized with no culture, 
                        just living an a enslaved environment were we have been 
                        conditioned to continuously live the way we live and accept 
                        it as being normal. we eat our processed food -go to work 
                        -drive our cars - produce extreme amounts of unnecesary 
                        trash as our daily rituals. its incredible how in other 
                        countries the most poor or less fortunate really know 
                        how to appreciate life and the true meaning of food and 
                        its nourishment to our souls and bodies. im jealous i 
                        wish i could have been sitting on that roof top with yall 
                        sharing a bowl of stew, drinking,laughing, living. but 
                        i was happy to watch on my t.v. at least that took me 
                        away from here even for an hour:)<br>

                        15 2008 @ 1:35 am Some how I just knew.... There is something 
                        about Anthony Bourdain that I just love and after tonights 
                        show about Colombia I'm reminded why. Only Bourdain could 
                        get it.... I mean really get it. Colombia is about its 
                        people and our ability to grab on to a moment and enjoy 
                        it like its our last. I'm not sure that everyone understood 
                        what Bourdain meant when he said "when you've had 
                        it bad you know how to enjoy the good" but no truer 
                        words have been said about my country. I thank Anthony 
                        Bourdain and the Travel Channel for getting to the essence 
                        of who Colombia is and her hope for the future. </p>

                        and my people. My heart fills with joy and my eyes fill 
                        with tears, as I read that you call my country a "Wonderland" 
                        I know it and the rest of Colombians know it! THANK YOU 
                        for making it known to the world. To stop being afraid, 
                        and visit Colombia. Because of the bad image Colombia 
                        took a huge hit in the tourism industry, but that may 
                        all be changing, thank you again. As usual another episode

                        episodes ive seen! I'm half Colombian so I was really 
                        looking forward to it!! Watching it really wants to make 
                        me go to Colombia, and explore my roots. It seems like 
                        such a beautiful place with great food. Now im even more

                        on your show, I enjoyed watching you eat "calentao" 
                        and drink "aguardiente", it could have been 
                        one of the coolest things ever...I want to thank you for

                        Anywho, you are truly spectacular! Not only because you 
                        share the same first name as my hero-of-a-husband who 
                        is volunteering his time as an active duty member of the

                        to GOD and the "No Reservations" cast [mainly

                        episode in an area where liquor is forbidden? I mean, 
                        we all witness how you enjoy your spirits, as much as 
                        my friends and I enjoy our wine, vodka and social punch!

                        @ 2:17 am I was smiling and crying throughout the entire 
                        episode. It made me long for my Medellin. Colombian hearts 
                        all over the world are filled with pride again tonight 
                        thanks to your incredible depiction of a remarkable country. 
                        Muchisimas gracias. P.S. Corrina, I don't understand if 
                        your stepfather is Colombian why you do not know how to 
                        spell "Colombia?" I was deeply saddened and 
                        troubled by your comments. As a child,I spent all of my 
                        summer vacations (including the violent 80s) in Medellin 
                        with family. I recall several of the bombings and the 
                        general fear that was always palpable whenever we would 
                        venture into the city. But I also remember laughing and 
                        dancing and camping trips and a deep hurt when I would 
                        have to say goodbye at the end of the summer. But I never, 
                        ever recall once seeing "guerrillas with AK-47s everywhere." 
                        Todo pais tiene cosas bonitas y feas. Lamentablemente, 
                        tu solo te enfocaste en lo feo. May tonight's show open 
                        your eyes to the real heart of a fantastic country.<br>

                        travel around this tasty and interesting globe. I am reading 
                        Kitchen Confidentials and love it. I think you need to 
                        do a Brooklyn,NY No Reservations. This borough is going 
                        through such a good time right now with Park Slope, Prospect 
                        Park, Williamsburg (minus the annoying Real World cast), 
                        Bensonhurst, Greenpoint and Bay Ridge to name a few...ok 
                        well that wasn't a few. But seriously check it out...Brooklyn

                        - July 15 2008 @ 3:16 am Mr. Bourdain, My name is Francisco 
                        (Frank) J. Correa Hernandez. I just finished watching 
                        your show and I was very moved by it. I would like to 
                        thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you did. 
                        I was there during the month of March and all everyone 
                        could talk about was your visit there. I currently reside 
                        in the California but I go back several times a year to 
                        visit my family. Hopefully by you doing this it will start 
                        a chain reaction in changing people's perception of my 
                        country. I am currently serving in the Marines and have 
                        been for the last 15 years. I am very proud of serving 
                        and of my heritage. If you ever would like to go back 
                        and visit my doors are open to you. I am glad that there 
                        are people like you who are willing to go and see and 
                        experience new things. By you doing so it shows the true 
                        side of the culture and it's people. I thank you, your 
                        staff, and the travel channel for what you did. Keep up 
                        the good work. If are ever near Oceanside, CA and would 
                        like an Arepa let me know I make a mean one. <br>

                        am I have to say that I am disappointed. God, they say, 
                        is in the details. Someone left the details out, for Mr 
                        Bourdain's visit to Medellin (I apologize, I have an American 
                        laptop and can't accent any letters correctly). No one 
                        told Mr Bourdain how to pronounce Medellin. LL /= Y in 
                        Antioquia. Mr Bourdain referred to Envigado as a low key 
                        neighborhood. In actuality, it is second only to El Poblado 
                        in status and quality of housing/living. Mr Bourdain referred 
                        to the Bandeja Paisa as the local form of the national 
                        dish. He could not be more wrong. There is no national 
                        dish. There are regional "platos tipicos" as 
                        there are regional tamales. Paisa means someone from Antioquia, 
                        so a Bandeja (platter) Paisa means the typical platter 
                        from Antioquia. The cute guide lady said that sancocho 
                        is made from from beef pork and chicken and alluded to 
                        some superstitious bull$%#@ about capturing the soul. 
                        sorry, witchcraft that is 100% that chick, and absolutely
