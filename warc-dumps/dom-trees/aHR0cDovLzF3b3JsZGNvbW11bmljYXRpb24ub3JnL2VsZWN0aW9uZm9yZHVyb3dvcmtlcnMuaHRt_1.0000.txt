       <b><font color="#7F0000">Despite recent intimidation and violence 
       against DURO workers, there is reason to believe that the Mexican 
       Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board will order a recuento 
       (election for union representational rights) at the Duro Paper Bag 
       maquila to be held next week. This is a huge step forward in the Duro 
       workers' struggle. The workers have been demanding a recuento 
       (election) for several months.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">Through a long, difficult and determined 
       struggle, workers at the Duro Bag maquila in Rio Bravo, Tamaulipas 
       won legal recognition for their independent Duro Workers Union last 
       August. They have been fighting ever since to get the Mexican 
       government to call an election (recuento) for workers to decide 
       whether that union will have sole bargaining rights to represent the 
       workers in collective bargaining with Duro. The workers are currently 
       officially represented by the Paper Workers Union of the 
       Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), a PRI-affiliated union that 
       has colluded with the company against the workers.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">On January 19, the 30 members of the 
       Coalition for Justice in the Maquilas (a tri-national NGO) board of 
       directors met with Virgilio Mena Becerra, Federal Conciliation and 
       Arbitration Board President, in Mexico City to urge him to honor the 
       Duro workers legal right to a recuento. Becerra said he would look at 
       the situation, but gave no promises.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">When Duro workers presented a petition to 
       the Federal CAB in Mexico City last week, 20 burly CROC, a 
       PRI-affiliated union (the PRI was the ruling party in Mexico for over 
       70 years), thugs showed up and attempted to provoke a fight. 
       Experienced observers of the Mexican labor scene indicated that the 
       company directly paid the thugs for this intimidation, and that it is 
       evidence that Duro Bag Manufacturing Company, has decided to use 
       violence against the workers.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">On January 23, the General Secretary of the 
       CTM Paper Workers Union, Eduardo Castillo, unexpectedly traveled from 
       Mexico City to Rio Bravo. There, he met with the 150 fired Duro 
       workers at the encampment in the town plaza that they have maintained 
       for 7 months. Castillo attempted to bribe the workers not to 
       participate in the union election by offering them reinstatement to 
       their jobs, back pay, better working conditions and other incentives. 
       The workers, knowing that the ability to negotiate in the future will 
       depend on getting the union they support recognized, rejected the offer.</font></b></p>

       <b><font color="#7F0000">BACKGROUND ON DURO STRUGGLE</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The Duro plant is a maquiladora located in 
       the city of Rio Bravo, Tamaulipas bordering Pharr, Texas, and about 
       15 minutes from Reynosa (across the US border from McAllen, TX). Duro 
       assembles gift bags for different corporations such as Hallmark and 
       Neiman Marcus. The company is privately held, family-owned, and is 
       based in Ludlow, Kentucky. Duro workers put up their strike banners 
       on June 12 in order to establish an independent union and to force 
       the reinstatement of their elected leaders who were illegally fired. 
       They have been occupying an encampment in Rio Bravo's town plaza 
       since that day.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The workers demand the right to be 
       represented by a union willing to negotiate better working conditions 
       such as: medical attention inside the plant, life insurance, bathroom 
       breaks, basic safety equipment and sanitary conditions in the 
       bathrooms and cafeteria.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The governor's office has acknowledged that 
       Duro has some of the worst working conditions of any of the 
       maquiladoras (factories producing for export) in the area. The 
       workers were forcefully and illegally removed from the Duro premises 
       by police armed with machine guns on the first day that they put up 
       their strike banners. Mexican law grants workers the right to strike 
       and to close the production facilities with such banners.</font></b></p>
