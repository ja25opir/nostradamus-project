<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 16.0pt">DNA 
identifies new ancient human dubbed 'X-woman'</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Paul Rincon </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Science reporter, BBC News</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Scientists have identified a previously 
unknown type of ancient human through analysis of DNA from a finger bone 
unearthed in a Siberian cave.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The extinct "hominin" (human-like 
creature) lived in Central Asia between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An international team has sequenced 
genetic material from the fossil showing that it is distinct from that of 
Neanderthals and modern humans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Details of the find, dubbed "X-woman", 
have been published in Nature journal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ornaments were found in the same ground 
layer as the finger bone, including a bracelet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Professor Chris Stringer, human origins 
researcher at London's Natural History Museum, called the discovery "a very 
exciting development".</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Whoever carried this mitochondrial 
genome out of Africa about a million years ago is some new creature that has not 
been on our radar screens so far&nbsp; </span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Svante Paabo</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary 
Anthropology</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"This new DNA work provides an entirely 
new way of looking at the still poorly-understood evolution of humans in central 
and eastern Asia."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The discovery raises the intriguing 
possibility that three forms of human - Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and the 
species represented by X-woman - could have met each other and interacted in 
southern Siberia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tiny fragment of bone from a fifth 
finger was uncovered by archaeologists working at Denisova Cave in Siberia's 
Altai Mountains in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An international team of researchers 
extracted mitochondrial DNA from the bone and compared the genetic sequence with 
those from modern humans and Neanderthals.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Origin unknown</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mitochondrial DNA comes from the cell's 
powerhouses and is passed down the maternal line only.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The analysis carried out by Johannes 
Krause from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, 
Germany, and colleagues revealed the human from Denisova last shared a common 
ancestor with modern humans and Neanderthals about one million years ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This is known as the divergence date; 
essentially, when this human's ancestors split away from the line that 
eventually led to Neanderthals and ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Neanderthal and modern human 
evolutionary lines diverged much later, around 500,000 years ago. This shows 
that the individual from Denisova is the representative of a previously unknown 
human lineage that derives from a hitherto unrecognised migration out of Africa.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Whoever carried this mitochondrial 
genome out of Africa about a million years ago is some new creature that has not 
been on our radar screens so far," said co-author Professor Svante Paabo, also 
from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The divergence date of one million years 
is too young for the Denisova hominin to have been a descendent of Homo erectus, 
which moved out of Africa into Asia some two million years ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And it is too old to be a descendent of 
Homo heidelbergensis, another ancient human thought to have originated around 
650,000 years ago. However, for now, the researchers have steered away from 
describing the specimen as a new species.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Krause said the ground layer in which 
the Denisova hominin fragment was found contain tools which are similar to those 
made by modern humans in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Slice of time</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We have ornaments, there is a bracelet, 
so there are several elements in the layers that are usually associated with 
modern human archaeology," he told BBC News.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"That's quite interesting, but of 
course, it is hard to prove that the bone is strongly associated to this 
archaeology, because it is possible that bones could have moved within the site.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We are also not sure how exactly the 
excavation was done. It could have come from a deeper layer, so that's hard to 
say."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The "Hobbit" persisted until 12,000 
years ago on Flores</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Professor Clive Finlayson, director of 
the Gibraltar Museum, said the find presented a number of questions, such as to 
what extent culture could continue to be used as a proxy for different 
prehistoric human groups.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Referring to his research on 
Neanderthals and modern humans in southern Iberia, he told BBC News: "The 
assumption is that when one group - the moderns - arrives the other group 
disappears. Here you have a very clear example of co-existence for long periods.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Where is the rule that says you can 
have only one species in an area? Especially if they're at low density... the 
implications are big."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The research contributes to a more 
complex picture that has been emerging of humankind during the Late Pleistocene, 
the period when modern humans left Africa and started to colonise the rest of 
the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Professor Finlayson has previously 
argued: "A time slice at a point in the late Pleistocene would reveal a range of 
human populations spread across parts of Africa, Eurasia and Oceania.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Some would have been genetically linked 
to each other, behaving as sub-species, while the more extreme populations may 
well have behaved as good species with minimal or no interbreeding."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was long known that modern humans 
overlapped with Neanderthals in Europe, apparently for more than 10,000 years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But in 2004, researchers discovered that 
a dwarf species of human, dubbed "The Hobbit", was living on the Indonesian 
island of Flores until 12,000 years ago - long after modern humans had colonised 
the region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Difficult classification</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Neanderthals appear to have been living 
at Okladnikov Cave in the Altai Mountains some 40,000 years ago. And a team led 
by Professor Anatoli Derevianko, from the Russian Academy of Sciences, has also 
found evidence of a modern human presence in the region at around the same time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Professor Stringer commented: "Another 
intriguing question is whether there might have been overlap and interaction 
between not only Neanderthals and early moderns in Asia, but also, now, between 
either of those lineages and this newly-recognised one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The distinctiveness of the 
mitochondrial DNA patterns so far suggests that there was little or no 
interbreeding, but more extensive data will be needed from other parts of the 
genome, or from the fossils, for definitive conclusions to be reached."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The archaeology of Denisova presents a 
puzzle of sorts</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Experts have been wondering whether 
X-woman might have links with known fossil humans from Asia, which have 
controversial classifications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Certain enigmatic Asian fossils dated 
between 250,000-650,000 years ago such as Narmada (in India), and Yunxian, Dali 
and Jinniushan (in China) have been considered as possible Asian derivatives of 
Homo heidelbergensis, so they are also potential candidates for this mystery 
non-erectus lineage," said Prof Stringer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"However, there are other and younger 
fragmentary fossils such as the Denisova ones themselves, and partial skulls 
from Salkhit in Mongolia and Maba in China, which have been difficult to 
classify, and perhaps they do signal a greater complexity than we have 
appreciated up to now."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Other experts agreed that while the 
Siberian specimen may be a new species, this has yet to be shown.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We really don't know," Ian Tattersall 
of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, told the Associated Press 
news agency.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Tattersall, who wasn't involved in 
the new research, added: "The human family tree has got a lot of branchings. 
It's entirely plausible there are a lot of branches out there we don't know 
about."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The oldest stone wall in Greece, which 
has stood at the entrance of a cave in Thessaly for the last 23,000 years, has 
been discovered by palaeontologists, the ministry of culture said Monday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The age of the find, determined by an 
optical dating test, singles it out as "probably one of the oldest in the 
world", according to a ministry press release.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The dating matches the coldest period 
of the most recent ice age, indicating that the cavern's paleolithic inhabitants 
built it to protect themselves from the cold", said the ministry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The wall blocked two-thirds of the 
entrance to the cave, located close to Kalambaka, itself near the popular 
tourist area and monastic centre of Meteora in central Greece. Greek 
palaeontologists have been excavating the site for the last 25 years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Tal Bokrous is a sample of the first 
agricultural village built according to the architectural style of the Stone Age 
in Deir Ezzor, (432 kms northeast of Damascus, Syria). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The site is the only archaeological 
discovery at the Middle Euphrates Region which belongs to the booming phase of 
the Neolithic era.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Neolithic era (New Stone Age), was a 
period in the development of human technology, begining about 9500 BC in the 
Middle East that is traditionally considered the last part of the Stone Age.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The adjacent houses built along the two 
sides of the village yard show the greatness of the architectural style at that 
period.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologist Yarub al-Abdullah said 
"The number of the unearthed houses has amounted to 188, each house includes 
three rooms built of dry brick while the floors and walls were painted with mud 
or plaster."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some walls were decorated with colorful 
paintings representing ducks and goose, he added.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The remains of charred plants were found 
at plaster-made louvers as a farming community used to live there depending on 
agriculture and keeping livestock.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Studies showed that barley used to grow 
naturally at the site, after that the local inhabitants developed agriculture 
and started to sow grain and lentils.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Handicrafts mainly depended on the 
available raw materials such as alabaster and obsidian stones.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many stone-made needles, drills, 
sculptures and utensils were unearthed at the site.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Tow sculptures of naked women and a 
man's head made of baked mud were the most important discoveries at the site.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The archeological findings fill an

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Loving couples always wish to die on the 
same day, and a couple who lived 4,200 years ago in the Sanxing Village of Mimou 
Township, Qingbaijiang District, fulfilled such a wish. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Chengdu Municipal Institute of 
Cultural Relics and Archaeology recently discovered an ancient grave during an 
excavation on a large prehistoric cultural site, in which a couple was found 
laying and hugging each other. The bones of the "oldest" couple are clearly 
visible. Excavation work also discovered numerous exquisite stone vessels, 
porcelains, housing ruins as well as graves dating form China's ancient Shang 
Dynasty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Sanxingcun site, located in the 
sixth group of the Sanxing Village in Mimou Township, Qingbaijiang section of 
the Chengdu-Mianyang-Leshan inter-city railway line, covers an area of about 
28,000 sqm, through which the Chengdu-Mianyang Highway runs. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In May 2004, the Chengdu Municipal 
Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology excavated part of the site's 
western side. Archaeologists believe that the Sanxingcun site was once a large 
ancient settlement in the Chengdu Plain in China's ancient Shang and Zhou 
dynasties. There have always been settlers on this land over the past 4,000-plus 
years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Plenty of porcelains and stone vessels 
were excavated from the Sanxingcun site, such as flat-bottomed pots and jars 
with high handles that people in the period of the Sanxingdui culture used to 
hold items and food. An ivory pottery was found that exactly resembles a bird's 
head and is engraved with curved lines similar to the lines on the bronze 
vessels dug from the Sanxingdui Relics. Polished tools–stone axes, chisels, 
spears and knives still looked very fine and sharp.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The site, located near Fujiacun village

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">About 30 metres of the wall surrounding

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">She looked like a sick woman who was 
asleep.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The thing was – she had been sleeping 
for several centuries, underground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The body of Pham Thi Dang, second wife 
of Dang Dinh Tuong – a high-ranking official under the Le Dynasty (1428-1788) 
was found 42 years ago in Van Cat Hamlet, in the northern province of Nam Ha 
(now Nam Dinh).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“We had excavated many mummies, but we 
couldn’t help being shocked when seeing her, because she looked as if she were 
just a sick woman who was sleeping,” says Do Dinh Truat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Decades after studying mummies 
discovered across the country – from the bodies of royalty and senior officials 
to the common man, archeologists Do Van Ninh and Truat are still amazed by the 
ancient Vietnamese technique of preserving bodies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Despite not having their internal organs 
and brains, as in Egyptian mummies, their bodies were usually found in good 
condition - soft with joints still supple after being buried for hundreds of 
years, they said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some still retained the facial features 
they had when they were alive, Truat said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the case of Dang, the veteran 
archeologist even asked a local woman who was at the same age as Dang, 60 years 
old, to stand next to the body “to see who was more beautiful.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to the archeologists, one of 
the secrets in the Vietnamese techniques of preserving bodies was pine oil, 
which they say has been found in most mummies</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archeologist Do Dinh Truat with a clod 
of solid essential pine oil found in an old coffin</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The late Prof. Do Xuan Hop, known to 
many as the “King of Anatomy” was one of the scientists who studied the body of 
King Le Du Tong (1679-1731) which was found in 1958 in the central province of 
Thanh Hoa. Hop noted that the king was placed in a coffin that contained lots of 
pine oil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The oil made quilted blankets, clothes 
and shrouds oily, while “the fragrance soaked into his skin and through skin 
into his internal organs, so [he was] soaked with aroma,” Hop wrote, noting that 
betel leaves and areca buried with him also remained fresh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thanks to the oil, the Le Dynasty king’s 
body remained in rather good condition during the 46 years it was kept at the 
Hanoi-based National History Museum before being reburied earlier this year 
despite the harsh weather in the north, scientists said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The importance of pine oil was stressed 
in another article by Hop.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He wrote that the body of a royal wife 
from the Trinh Lords (1545- 1787), found in 1957, was only examined by 
scientists a month later. During that month the body was taken out of the coffin 
and buried in the field for three days before being put into another coffin 
flooded with water (though it is not clear why this was done). However, it still 
gave out the pine oil’s aroma.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The body was later washed five times, 
yet the aroma didn’t fade away, Hop wrote.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Truat also recalled his first 
impressions of the mummies he saw. “Many people think mummies must stink, but 
amazingly, they give out the aroma of some wood.” The archeologist said he even 
once tasted the water at the bottom of a mummy’s coffin and found that it wasn’t 
fetid, but tasted like turpentine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Besides the pine oil, other things like 
blankets, pillows and clothes which were considered customary belongings for 
placement in the coffins, worked in fact to get rid of the humidity in coffins, 
Ninh said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This was also true of the tam that tinh 
(Seven-star plank), which was usually placed under the body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Under Taoism, the plank with seven holes 
placed in the shape of Ursa Major, or the Great Bear constellation, was believed 
to protect the deceased’s spirit from evil spirits and ghosts. But it also 
helped drain water to the 20- centimeter thick layer of roasted rice below, Ninh 
said</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The roasted rice also acted to help 
remove humidity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ninh said dying people usually had some 
ruou que (cinnamon wine) to lengthen their life for some time to meet all of 
their children, and they would be washed with the wine again after their death. 
The wine would help clean the body, within and outside, decreasing the harmful 
effects of bacteria, he surmised.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was also a custom that Vietnamese 
people lit candles in the coffin before putting the body in, and this also 
helped create a vacuum and kill bacteria, according to Ninh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Truat said one of the most noticeable 
things about Vietnamese mummies was that they were mostly interred in coffins 
made of ngoc am (or pemou wood) which was highly resistant to termites and 
bacteria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The coffins were made by highly skilled 
carpenters, airsealed and then plastered them with a mixture of raw paints, and 
sawdust with or without a sticky substance from pine trees mixed with rice 
paste. Some coffins were made with two layers, with the outer coffins as thick 
as 0.5 meters, made with lime, sand, molasses or honey, and sometimes 
strengthened with shell crumbles (not made of wood).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some outer coffins were so strong that 
it took 15 young men 40 days to break it, like the one that Nguyen Thi Hieu, 
believed to be a family member of King Gia Long (1802-1820) under the Nguyen 
Dynasty, was buried in. Her body, found 16 years ago, is being kept at the Ho 
Chi Minh City History Museum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“At the Thuy Xuan Beach in the northern 
province of Thai Binh, an outer coffin was smoothened by waves over the years, 
yet locals didn’t realize that (it was an outer coffin) until they accidentally 
excavated it and found the complete body of a young lady,” Truat said, 
demonstrating that the body was not damaged even though the coffin was buried on 
the coast and exposed to factors like salt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Phan Bao Khanh, who has studied many 
mummies in the central region, said the Vietnamese technique of preserving 
bodies was “a very human way to preserve bodies, as no knives or scissors were 
used to take out the deceased’s brains and internal organs.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But it was a pity that this knowledge 
has been lost with the passage of time, he said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A piece of Liverpool's buried past is to 
go on show to the public for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The historic Old Dock at Liverpool - now 
below the Liverpool One - will become the city's latest visitor attraction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It has been hidden underground for 
nearly 200 years but property developer Grosvenor has partnered with the 
museum's service to put part of the remains on display.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologist Jamie Quartermaine, who 
masterminded the project, said the importance of the dock should not be 
forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He said: “The dock is a very important 
part of Liverpool's history.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“It can become a very successful tourist 
attraction and help the city in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Engineer Thomas Steers – who originally 
built the berth in 1715 - is widely recognised as helping to kick-start 
Liverpool's rapid rise to importance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">His dock building skills allowed ships 
to load and unloads goods even at low tide.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Regular tours of the new attraction, run 
by National Museums Liverpool, are due to begin in May and will start at the 
Merseyside Maritime Museum.</span></p>
