			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">The dream of cooking innovative, 
			original cuisine was a deciding factor in choosing to study at 
			Academia. Of the many schools available in the greater Melbourne 
			area, Academia struck me as an institute that cared more about 
			seeing its students excel in their chosen path than the financial 
			aspect that drives many institutions today. As an Australian student 
			studying Commercial Cookery, it was this intangible aspect of the 
			environment that first appealed to me. As a smaller college, the 
			school seemed to have more time for its students, learning on a more 
			personal scale than other colleges offering Cookery courses. </font>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">Four months in, I have not been 
			disappointed. The staff and management have helped me every step of 
			the way, making the decision ever more worth while. The government 
			funding programme is another advantage, assisting Australian 
			students like myself with opportunities otherwise unavailable.&nbsp; I am 
			confident that after one year of study I will be more than ready to 
			tackle the obstacles life throws at me in a pace-driven industry 
			like hospitality. Therefore I can express nothing but gratitude to 
			the school educating me for what lies in the future. As an aspiring 
			Chef I couldn’t wish for anything more.</font></p>

			this course has proved to be worth all the efforts I put in to get 
			here. I was amazed and pleased to discover the variety of 
			disciplines the course offers. The lecturers are all professional, 
			very resourceful and helpful. Coming to college has broadened my

			chance to mix with people from all over the world. Studying at 
			academia is a great experience and I would advise any international 
			student to do the same. I am more then grateful that I decided to

			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">Hi, my name is Junko Honda. I am 
			from Japan.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">I have been to Australia about 3 
			years. At first I only wanted to learn English in Australia but as 
			time went by I fell in love with Australia.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">Hence I decided to study 
			Patisserie at Academia International College because becoming a 
			famous pastry cook has been my dream since I was a child and my 
			migration agent told me that if I studied Patisserie, I could apply 
			Permanent Residency . Then I tried to find out some information 
			about colleges that offer Patisserie course. Luckily I found 
			Academia International College. For me the biggest attraction of 
			Academia was that Academia International College has an affiliation 
			with Langham Hotel so the students can go to Langham Hotel to have a 
			work experience while they are studying at Academia. Also Academia 
			was the only one that has all the practical classes in the same 
			building so I don’t have to travel around a lot. The other important 
			issue for me at that time was, I wanted to study in a real 
			international college. There were a lot of colleges that had only 
			one or two nationalities dominating the whole colleges which I 
			didn’t like. In Academia, I truly enjoyed the real multicultural 
			environment while I was studying and eventually I have received my 
			Permanent Residency after I graduated my study at Academia. </font>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">I sincerely appreciate Academia 
			and truly recommend prospect students to go and visit Academia and 
			start your academic journey with Academia International College.
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">Now I am working 7 days a week 
			to save some money to buy a house. I want to meet a lot more 
			Academia graduates to succeed in their future lives.&nbsp; Thank 
			you. </font></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1">Why Academia? Academia is truly 
			an International College with more than 40 nationalities across the 
			world. A key difference with Academia is that there is not a single 
			dominant nationality. Other colleges have up to 90% of their student 
			base coming from a single Nationality. The first impression of 
			Academia is how clean it is plus its facilities are all in house you 
			do not have to take public transport to go to rented kitchens or 
			salons. Academia’s Trainers are professional, well organized and 
			extremely supportive knowing that their majority of students do not 
			have English as their first language. Come and join me at Academia 
			International and attend one of the best schools in a one of the 
			world’s best multicultural city Melbourne Australia.</font></p>

			in proving myself as the better student they guide me so very 
			cooperatively at that same moment. I got chance to study from about 
			16 trainers &amp; everybody was impressive and very professional. They 
			not only given us lectures but also entertain us in between classes 
			to boost up our energy. The surrounding environment is really very 
			good-the campus itself which located in the heart of the Melbourne 
			city, which makes the whole thing very easy specially for overseas 
			students, as far as transport is concerned The big, hygienic, well 
			equipped, well managed kitchens. The classmates who belong to many 
			different countries and so I feel it very interesting because I come 
			to know about different characters, who have different food habits &amp; 
			vice versa. I surely spent the great time in Academia International. 
			I can say my experience at Academia International in one word and 
			that’s “Awesome”. </font></p>
