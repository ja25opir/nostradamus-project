Just a few weeks ago, predictions of Arctic ice collapse were buzzing all over the Internet. Some scientists were predicting (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/06/080620-north-pole.html) that the “North Pole may be ice-free for first time this summer”. Others predicted (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/01/content_7696460.htm) that the entire “polar ice cap would disappear this summer”.

The Arctic melt season is nearly done for this year. The sun is now very low above the horizon and will set for the winter at the North Pole in five weeks. And none of these dire predictions have come to pass.

The article goes on to point out some curious discrepancies in this summer’s Arctic ice data. For complete details, click here (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/15/goddard_arctic_ice_mystery/) . In a nutshell the Arctic ice data for summer 2008 shows an increase over 2007 of 10% to 30%.

As we’ve pointed out in this space before, Al Gore et. al. can try to predict what they think the weather or climate will be in the future, but ultimately it is not their decision. The weather and/or climate is under no obligation to fulfill Gore’s fantastic prophecies. From my perspective it’s God’s will.
