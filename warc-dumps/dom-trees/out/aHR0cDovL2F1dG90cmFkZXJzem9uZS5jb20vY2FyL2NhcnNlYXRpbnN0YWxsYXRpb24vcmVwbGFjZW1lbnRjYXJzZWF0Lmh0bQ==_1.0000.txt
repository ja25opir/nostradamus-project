</p>
<p>Sometimes you will get it by leaving. If you didn't get it by doing so, don'tbe disappointed. Then go to the second dealer. Using the same process but don'tleave so early this time. If you can not get the car, then go up another $ 500.</p>
<p><span> Note that I specifically asked about the tire   life when I bought the van and the dealer stated it was 35K miles. &nbsp;So   today I had the dealer I went to contact the Michelin rep to start the   claim, they agreed to pay 70% of the tire cost for the two tires that   were out of spec, so it cost me $170+/- to get the two tires replaced   after one year, and it looks like I will be doing two more at full price   in 6 months unless Michelin comes to their senses. &nbsp;My local tire   dealer (non-PAX) said he would put together a tire/rim package for the   local Touring owners as he has started seeing quite a few people come in   with less than 20k miles and shot tires. &nbsp;He said it reminded him of   the Ford Explorer tire fiasco a few years ago.</span></p>
<p><span><span id="Span1">Many people are afraid to buy a used car at an auction.   They are afraid of making a mistake and ending up with a "lemon". This   fear is natural. It is also completely called for if you don’t know what   you are doing. There are a few things you need to know before you even   attempt to buy a car at a used car auction.</span></span></p>
<p>If you buy the car by financing. Always pay attention to the APR. DifferentAPR means different price. </p>
<p>What I do when I have a question like this is go to one of the online   Toyota dealer's parts sites or call or go to your local Toyota dealer.    Tell them the year and model of the car and the part you are looking   for.  If they ask for a vin number or ask whether the car is made in the   US or Japan, then you know they are different.  If they don't ask, then   it shouldn't matter.</p>
<p>Supercharger kits are available for the Camry (Solara) V6 via Toyota's   TRD division. If you can find a junked Solara from that year, you can do   the engine/tranny/ECM swap then bolt on the blower. You even get a   warranty on it. But granted, it puts out a tepid 4 psi boost. Any engine   you want to withstand the boost you're looking for will need serious   upgrading.</p>
<p>Read vehicle ads on local newspapers. Read the price they asking for the carsyou want. Then minus $ 500 from the lowest price in the newspaper. This is theprice you will offer. This is not the real value of the car. But this price willbe a good deal for you to get the car. </p>
<p><span> If the car is being bid on   only by used car dealers, the chances are good that you will be able to   snap up the vehicle at a price at (or very close to) the wholesale   price. Car dealers of course want to be able to on sell there purchases   at a fair price so they too will only bid up to what they consider a   realistic price. The dealers are easy to spot because of the volume of   cars they buy. &nbsp;<br>  <br>Too many people who make the effort to go to an   auction looking for a car make the mistake of choosing only one car, one   particular vehicle, and that’s bad. This means they may get into a   bidding war with someone else interested in the very same car and as a   result will pay way too much for their used car and be disappointed, or   get the car they wanted and pay too much.  </span></p>
<p><span>Check tire pressure on RFT more diligently than with non-RFT tires, bcs   our eyes cannot detect low pressure well. Do not let the TPMS fool us   into having a false sense of security and check the tires less   frequently. This is probably an important factor behind a lot of   unhappiness about RFT, Bridgestone or not. Ideally, car makers will want   to switch to using "direct" TPMS in the future such that the pressure   on all 4 tires are checked electronically and displayed on the dash   board by pushing a button. Until then, this new technology really   requires more careful attention from owners, not less.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to contact the us marshals office to find which   auction they send the drug cars to, or contact your local banks and   credit unions to see if they have repossessions up for bids, if they do   don't be afraid of insulting anyone by low biding even if they have a   start price.  if you can prepare for purchasing a car a few months   before you need to buy that's the best way to get your best deal.</span><br>  <br>  </span><br></p>
<p>Just cleaned/regapped my spark plugs and cleaned up the cap &amp; rotor   contacts.  Because of oil collecting on the inside bottom of the cap, I   decided to go ahead and replace the o-ring oil seal as well.  But last   night when looking at the dist out of the engine, I'm wasn't sure that   replacing that large o-ring will solve the problem.  There looks to be a   way for oil to get to the distributor shaft bearing (shoulda gotten   pics) on purpose, but is there another smaller o-ring or seal that I've   overlooked? The exploded diagrams I can find don't actually explode the   distributor, so I can't see one and attempting to disassemble it was   futile for the time I had.</p>
<p><span>Continental seems to get   less less complaints and they are less expensive than the OEM   Bridgestone EL42-RFT. I asked the local Town Fair Tire store and they   told me that they could get the Conti overnight and costs about $200.   Tirerack.com carries it for about $150 + shipping/mounting/balance.   Getting 20K miles out of the Bridgestone is not so bad as it has a   relatively low rating on wear compared to others. There has been some   talk about the Bridgestone having a new modified version, but it's   unclear if that's actually true. </span></p>
<p><span id="Span1">This is a follow-up of my original post, where I had   reported the tire going completely flat in a few hours and then held the   pressure for more than a day later. I brought it to Town Fair Tire for   an inspection. They took the tire off the wheel, smooth the rim and   remounted it. I was told that there was a bit of corrosion and roughness   on the rim. This makes sense to me as the leak may vary depending on   whether the rough spot is close to the ground when the car is parked.</span></p>
