Luckily Lance woke up without any issues because getting him out of bed can sometimes be a real problem. The starting point was at near a village called Mosu on the south side of the Sua Pan.&nbsp; The Makgadikgadi Pans consists of 2 big pans the one east side is called Sua and the one on the north is Ntwetwe. For me to be able to say I crossed the Makgadikgadi Pans I needed to cross both.</p><p></p><div class="slideshow cut">

</script>&nbsp; <p></p><p>So just after Mosu village we turned off onto a track that led to near the south side of the Sua pan. We drove as far on this track as we thought the card could go before getting stuck and then started to setup the trailer and all the kit. Lance joined me to the start of the pan to take some photos and a video of me starting off. I eventually got going at around 8:20am.</p><p><a href="/images/stories/makgadikgadi/panos/start_pano_big.jpg" title="Start walking on Sua pan" rel="lightbox"><img src="/images/stories/makgadikgadi/panos/start_pano_small.jpg" border="0" alt="Start walking on Sua pan" title="Start walking on Sua pan" width="640"></a></p><p><strong>Start walking on the south side of Sua Pan - Click to Enlarge</strong></p><p>The first 10km was no problem at all. The pan surface was hard and although the weight of all my water, food and other kit was between 75-80kg it was relatively easy to pull. Once the heat got to bad at around 11:00am I stopped and made a little shelter with a groundsheet I bought so I could stay out of the sun until it cooled down enough for me to carry on. When I constructed my little shelter there was no wind at all so I didn’t do much effort to tie down the ground sheet. While I was lying down a sudden burst of wind blew the groundsheet of and I had to run after it. At just after 3:00pm I thought I would start walking again.</p><p>It wasn’t long before I encountered the first wetter sections of the Sua pan. With such incredible heat during the day you would think that the pan would be completely dry but the truth was that it wasn’t.&nbsp; The wetter the pan surface became the harder it became to pull the trailer. The surface was now wet clay that stuck to everything and the tires of the trailer was completely covered and slick. The bottom of my shoes also had clay stuck to it in a thick layer and I could not grip properly. This made pulling the heavy trailer quite hard work and I had to stop every 400-600m to catch my breath and drink water.</p><p></p><div class="slideshow cut">

</script> <p></p><p>I planned to do at least 20km the first day and then another 20km the second to get me to Khubu Island, a famous spot on the edge of the Sua pan, so I struggled on for the last couple of kilometers until I reached a total of 20km for the day. By the time I stopped the pan surface was a soaking mess of clay covered by a layer of salt. At least I was so far onto the pan that I hardly saw any footprints of animals around which meant I would sleep without worrying too much.</p><p>One of my big concerns for this walk was dangerous wild animals. And although I asked people that has been to the region about dangerous animals on the pans and was informed that I didn’t need to worry I still had a lot of people (people that have obviously never been to the area) asking me about lions and telling me to be very careful. So it was something that was always on my mind. O and seeing a massive footprint of some kind of predator about 4km into the walk didn’t help put my mind at ease.</p><!-- START of joscomment --><!-- END of joscomment --><p></p><br><br></div>

The mouse quickly ran and jumped onto the groundsheet again and disappeared into the folds. It is a massive groundsheet so I didn’t want to unfold it completely to look for the mouse so I just shook it very well.</p><p>The first 10km of the day was again a struggle in the wet and salty clay and took a lot of energy to get through, but after that the pan surface gradually improved and got harder and dryer. I could see Khubu on the horizon to I had something to aim for and I put my head down and walked as hard as I could.&nbsp; In the last 10km I saw hundreds of eggs. These are flamingo eggs and at one stage I could count over 50 big eggs without moving. <br>I only managed to get to the island at 11:35 and by that time I was baking in the sun. I headed straight for the first big tree and took only the food bag and water with me and left my trailer at the edge of the island.&nbsp; As I grabbed the food bag I saw that the mouse from earlier the morning was still in between my things. Shame the little guy was hitching a ride and was now 20km away from home.</p><p>Only at 3:30pm did I dare go back into the sun to look for a nice spot somewhere around the island to camp. On the one side of the island there is a campsite but I didn’t want to camp between all the other tourists and get asked about the trailer all the time. When people see the trailer they want to know what the hell I’m up to and I just wanted to be left alone. One of the locals that help to run the campsite came past me later that evening on his bicycle when I was busy eating and I called him to stop. I wanted to get some information from him about the route I was planning to follow and about these dangerous wild animals I was stressing about.</p><p></p><div class="slideshow cut">

In my initial planning I wanted to use this track but all the pictures that I could find that had this track on looked to me as if the sand would be too soft which makes pulling the trailer very difficult. He said the track is only soft in very few sections and would recommend I take it. He also said that I should not worry about wild animals unless I go very close to the Makgadikgadi Nature Reserve which is on the west edge of the Ntwetwe Pan.&nbsp; The section of bush where I will walk tomorrow is all used for cattle farming and there would be no dangerous wild animals. Yipee.</p><p>Khubu Island is a magical place. There are some of the biggest Baobab trees I’ve ever seen in my live and you can climb on some huge rocks to get a great view of the pans. I would definitely go back there again in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/images/stories/makgadikgadi/panos/khubu_pano_big.jpg" title="View South from Khubu Island" rel="lightbox"><img src="/images/stories/makgadikgadi/panos/khubu_pano_small.jpg" border="0" alt="View South from Khubu Island" title="View South from Khubu Island" width="640"></a></p><p><strong>View south (where I came from) from Khubu Island - Click to Enlarge</strong></p><!-- START of joscomment --><!-- END of joscomment --><p></p><br><br></div>

I made good time and the trailer felt a bit lighter because I have eaten most of the canned food and have gotten rid of at least 15 liters of water since starting off. Some people coming from Khubu stopped and talked to me and wanted to know what I was doing walking around with a trailer. Some European tourist even wanted to take photos of me. This was fine since it gave me a chance to talk to their guides who knew the area well enough to also tell me not to worry about animals.</p><p></p><div class="slideshow cut">

My big toes on both have developed big blisters because the shoes I am using are not really meant walking such long distances in. I can’t wear my hiking boots because I have some problem with my Achilles and the hiking boots press against my Achilles which makes it pain. By 3pm I could wait no more and packed my things and started off again. It was still very hot and I sweated like a pig.

</script>&nbsp;&nbsp; <p></p><p>Once on Ntwetwe pan I was happy to find that the pan surface was very smooth and hard and I made some good distance. Then the pan gradually became wetter and stickier until I saw this massive black shade in front of me. I know that the pan there was going to be very wet but I didn’t want to change my course because I was far from the side of the pan and if I turned to the center of the pan it might be a long distance before the pan became dry again and heading toward the side of the pan meant that I would have to go very close to the side before it became any drier. I was making such good progress and was annoyed with the situation that I decided to just walk straight through this sticky business and that nothing was going to make me change my route.</p><p></p><div class="slideshow cut">

</script>&nbsp;&nbsp; <p></p><p>I quickly changed my mind after about 50 meters into the dark grey muck when I was almost ankle deep in clay and slush. I was breathing very hard and knew that there was no way of walking straight any more. I was going to have to change my route. It took me a long some time just to turn my trailer around and get back onto normal ground again. I decided on walking back to the edge of the pan then head north again.&nbsp; When it was almost time to set up camp I smelt something stank of dead fish. Then in front of me appeared a lake. I was on the edge of a lake and if I carried on straight I might have ended up walking straight into it. I set up camp on the edge of the lake and watched the sun set which was very beautiful. </p><!-- START of joscomment --><!-- END of joscomment --><p></p><br><br></div>

I wanted to check if I could finish in a big last push. From what I could calculate from the GPS it would be around 35km and I had enough extra water to wet my shirt if I had to walk after 11am when it got unbearable hot. I was very glad to see the route choice I made to walk closer to the edge paid off and the pan was nice and smooth and I made very good time. Then I came to a section where I walked straight to the center of the pan and then north. Some of the sections had no tracks of even animal on and felt really untouched.</p><p>By 10am I have done a lot and could clearly see the trees on the horizon and thought that that must be the road. I was wrong.&nbsp; The last section was not quite as straight forward as just walking to the road on the pans. It was a mixture of grass islands and pan and I ended up following car tracks on the edges of the islands to find my way. This ended up adding an extra 10km to the distance which had to be walked during the hottest time of the day. I saw some antelope twice (Springboks I think). I had a 15 minute break at just after 12pm to get some food in and rest my legs before I continued on to the end.</p><p></p><div class="slideshow cut">

</script>&nbsp; <p></p><p>The last 10km felt like they took forever but it’s always that way with the last couple of kilometers. It was very hot and I had to wet my shirt and hat every 30 minutes or so. By the time I got to the road it was 2:40pm and I have been walking for almost eight and a half hours without much rest. I was tired but quickly packed and organized all my things. I also disassembled the trailer so I could start looking for a lift. After about 40 minutes a guy stopped and asked what I would pay him to take me to Francis Town since he was heading there himself. It was around 240km so I said I would give him 50 pula and off we went.</p><p>During the ride back he asked if I smoke dope. I told him no. Then he chucked me a ball of dope wrapped in tin foil and asked if I would clean and grind for him. I’m a nice guy so I helped the man out. He stopped just past a police checkpoint and rolled a splif and lit it as we pulled off.&nbsp; Then at the next roadblock he grabbed a hand full of coins as we pulled up to the police officer. That talked a bit then he pulled off away. I was sure the police officer must have been able to smell the dope fumes coming out of the cab but didn’t say anything. As we drove away he put the hand full of coins back where he got them. I wonder if that was what he was going to bribe the cop is there were questions asked about the smell, a hand full of coins.</p><p>I told him I would give him an extra 50 pula if he dropped me off at the campsite which was another 8km from the main road. He wanted more so we settled on 70 pula. I was paying too much but it was already dark and didn’t want to do another 8km since I already did 45km and was tired.<br>I got to the campsite and had a braai and some 2 minute noodle before taking a long hot shower. </p><!-- START of joscomment --><!-- END of joscomment --><p></p><br><br></div>
