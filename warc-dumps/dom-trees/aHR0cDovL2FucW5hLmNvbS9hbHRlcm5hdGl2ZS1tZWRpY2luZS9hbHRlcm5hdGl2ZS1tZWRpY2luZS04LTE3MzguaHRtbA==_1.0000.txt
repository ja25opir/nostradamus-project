 Will I be okay? I am around 170. I also smoked weed :o lol<hr><b>Answers:</b><hr><!--q-->
 You took something and don't know what it is?  How stupid can you be??<hr><!--q-->
 I think that's vicodin. Of course you'll be fine. Take a shot near it, get the juices flowin'. No, really though, you probably shouldn't. You'll be feeling well-mannered, though.<hr><!--q-->congratulations you've just taken: Acetaminophen Hydrocodone<br>
<br>
In case you dont know acetaminophen is the active ingredient contained by tylenol. harmless in low doses. But the Hydrocodone can be highly addicting and "impairing" so as i'm sure you probably know you should be dignified from it but i would suggest steering clear from it unless you want a full blown addiction to the things.<br>
oh and in the future this is a really good site to relieve you with pill:<br>
