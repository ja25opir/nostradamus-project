<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 16.0pt">DNA 
analysed from early European</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Paul Rincon </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Science reporter, BBC News</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Scientists have analysed DNA extracted 
from the remains of a 30,000-year-old European hunter-gatherer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Studying the DNA of long-dead humans can 
open up a window into the evolution of our species (Homo sapiens).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But previous studies of this kind have 
been hampered by scientists' inability to distinguish between the ancient human 
DNA and modern contamination.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Current Biology journal, a 
German-Russian team details how it was possible to overcome this hurdle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Svante Paabo, from the Max Planck 
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and colleagues used 
the latest DNA sequencing techniques to study genetic information from human 
remains unearthed in 1954 at Kostenki, Russia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Excavations at Kostenki, on the banks of 
the river Don in southern Russia, have yielded large concentrations of 
archaeological finds from the Palaeolithic (roughly 40,000 years ago to 10,000 
years ago). Some of the finds date back as far as 45,000 years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The DNA analysed in this study comes 
from a male aged 20-25 who was deliberately buried in an oval pit some 30,000 
years ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Known as the Markina Gora skeleton, it 
was found lying in a crouched position with fists reaching upwards and a face 
orientated down towards the dirt. The bones were covered in a pigment called red 
ochre, thought to have been used in prehistoric funeral rites.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The type of DNA extracted and analysed 
is that stored in mitochondria - the "powerhouses" of cells. This mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) is passed down from a mother to her offspring, providing a unique 
record of maternal inheritance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Using technology pioneered in the study 
of DNA from Neanderthal bones, they were able to distinguish between ancient 
genetic material from the Kostenki male and contamination from modern people who 
handled the bones, or whose DNA reached the remains by some other means.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The new approach, developed by Professor 
Paabo and his colleagues, exploits three features which tend to distinguish 
ancient DNA from modern contamination. One of these is size; fragments of 
ancient DNA are often shorter than those from modern sources.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Previous ancient DNA studies used the 
widespread polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. PCR amplifies a few 
pieces of genetic material, generating thousands to millions of copies of a 
sequence. But the researchers found many fragments of ancient DNA were too small 
to be amplified by PCR.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A second characteristic of ancient DNA 
was its tendency to show particular changes, or mutations, in the genetic 
sequence at the ends of DNA molecules.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A third feature was a characteristic 
breakage of molecules at particular positions in the DNA strand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The apparent ease with which modern DNA 
can infiltrate ancient remains has led many researchers to doubt even those 
studies employing the most rigorous methods to weed out contamination by modern 
genetic material.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The ironic thing is that our group has 
been one of those that raised this issue," Professor Paabo told BBC News.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"To take animal studies on cave bears, 
for example, if we use PCR primers specific for human DNA on cave bear bones, we 
can retrieve modern human DNA on almost every one. That has made me think: 'how 
can I trust anything on this'."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Using the new techniques, the 
researchers were able to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome of the Markina 
Gora individual.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Future studies like the one in Current 
Biology could help shed light on whether the humans living in Europe 30,000 
years ago are the direct ancestors of modern populations or whether they were 
replaced by immigrants who introduced farming to the continent several thousand 
years ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The modern gene pool contains a wide 
variety of mtDNA lineages. Studying these maternal lineages provides scientists 
with clues to the origins and histories of human populations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Scientists look for known genetic 
signatures in order to classify an individual's mtDNA into different types, or 
"haplogroups". These haplogroups represent major branches on the family tree of 
Homo sapiens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Early arrival</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The researchers were able to assign the 
Kostenki individual to haplogroup "U2", which is relatively uncommon among 
modern populations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">U2 appears to be scattered at low 
frequencies in populations from South and Western Asia, Europe and North Africa.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Despite its rarity, the very presence of 
this haplogroup in today's Europeans suggests some continuity between 
Palaeolithic hunters and the continent's present-day inhabitants, argue the 
authors of the latest study.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">U2, along with closely related 
haplogroups such as U5, are among those which could plausibly have arrived in 
Europe during the Palaeolithic.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Geneticists use well-established 
techniques to "date" particular genetic events, such as when a haplogroup first 
diversified. The "U" branch (comprising haplogroups U1, U2, U3 and so on) 
appears to be more ancient than many other genetic lineages found in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A recent study found a very high 
percentage of U types in the skeletal remains of ancient hunter-gatherers from 
Central Europe compared with later farming immigrants and modern people from the 
region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meanwhile, an analysis last year of 
mtDNA from 28,000-year-old remains unearthed at Paglicci Cave in Italy showed 
this individual belonged to haplogroup "H" - the most common type found in 
modern Europeans.</span></p>

reveals Noah's ark was circular</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Maev Kennedy</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">guardian.co.uk</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Friday 1 January 2010 22.35 GMT</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That they processed aboard the enormous 
floating wildlife collection two-by-two is well known. Less familiar, however, 
is the possibility that the animals Noah shepherded on to his ark then went 
round and round inside.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to newly translated 
instructions inscribed in ancient Babylonian on a clay tablet telling the story 
of the ark, the vessel that saved one virtuous man, his family and the animals 
from god's watery wrath was not the pointy-prowed craft of popular imagination 
but rather a giant circular reed raft.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The now battered tablet, aged about 
3,700 years, was found somewhere in the Middle East by Leonard Simmons, a 
largely self-educated Londoner who indulged his passion for history while 
serving in the RAF from 1945 to 1948.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The relic was passed to his son Douglas, 
who took it to one of the few people in the world who could read it as easily as 
the back of a cornflakes box; he gave it to Irving Finkel, a British Museum 
expert, who translated its 60 lines of neat cuneiform script.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There are dozens of ancient tablets that 
have been found which describe the flood story but Finkel says this one is the 
first to describe the vessel's shape.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"In all the images ever made people 
assumed the ark was, in effect, an ocean-going boat, with a pointed stem and 
stern for riding the waves – so that is how they portrayed it," said Finkel. 
"But the ark didn't have to go anywhere, it just had to float, and the 
instructions are for a type of craft which they knew very well. It's still 
sometimes used in Iran and Iraq today, a type of round coracle which they would 
have known exactly how to use to transport animals across a river or floods."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Finkel's research throws light on the 
familiar Mesopotamian story, which became the account in Genesis, in the Old 
Testament, of Noah and the ark that saved his menagerie from the waters which 
drowned every other living thing on earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In his translation, the god who has 
decided to spare one just man speaks to Atram-Hasis, a Sumerian king who lived 
before the flood and who is the Noah figure in earlier versions of the ark 
story. "Wall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall! Atram-Hasis, pay heed to my advice, 
that you may live forever! Destroy your house, build a boat; despise possessions 
And save life! Draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design; Let 
its length and breadth be the same."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tablet goes on to command the use of 
plaited palm fibre, waterproofed with bitumen, before the construction of cabins 
for the people and wild animals.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It ends with the dramatic command of 
Atram-Hasis to the unfortunate boat builder whom he leaves behind to meet his 
fate, about sealing up the door once everyone else is safely inside: "When I 
shall have gone into the boat, Caulk the frame of the door!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Fortunes were spent in the 19th century 
by biblical archaeology enthusiasts in hunts for evidence of Noah's flood. The 
Mesopotamian flood myth was incorporated into the great poetic epic Gilgamesh, 
and Finkel, curator of the recent British Museum exhibition on ancient Babylon, 
believes that it was during the Babylonian captivity that the exiled Jews 
learned the story, brought it home with them, and incorporated it into the Old 
Testament.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Despite its unique status, Simmons' 
tablet – which has been dated to around 1,700 BC and is only a few centuries 
younger than the oldest known account – was very nearly overlooked.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"When my dad eventually came home, he 
shipped a whole tea chest of this kind of stuff home – seals, tablets, bits of 
pottery," said Douglas. "He would have picked them up in bazaars, or when people 
knew he was interested in this sort of thing, they would have brought them to 
him and earned a few bob."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Simmons senior became a scenery worker 
at the BBC, but kept up his love of history, and was very disappointed when 
academics dismissed treasures of his as commonplace and worthless. His son took 
the tablet to a British Museum open day, where Finkel "took one look at it and 
nearly fell off his chair" with excitement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It is the most extraordinary thing," 
Simmons said of the tablet. "You hold it in your hand, and you instantly get a 
feeling that you are directly connected to a very ancient past – and it gives 
you a shiver down your spine."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The human fascination with the flood and 
the whereabouts of the ark shows few signs of subsiding.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The story has travelled down the 
centuries from the ancient Babylonians and continues to fascinate in the 21st 
century.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Countless expeditions have travelled to 
Mount Ararat in Turkey, where Noah's ark is said to have come to rest, but 
scientific proof of its existence has yet to be found.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Recent efforts to find it have been led 
by creationists, who are keen to exhibit it as evidence of the literal truth of 
the Bible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"If the flood of Noah indeed wiped out 
the entire human race and its civilization, as the Bible teaches, then the ark 
constitutes the one remaining major link to the pre-flood world," says John D 
Morris of the Institute for Creation Research.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"No significant artefact could ever be 
of greater antiquity or importance."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the Victorian era some became 
obsessed with the ark story. George Smith – the lowly British museum assistant 
who, in 1872, deciphered the Flood Tablet which is inscribed with the Assyrian 
version of the Noah's ark tale – could apparently not contain his excitement at 
his discovery.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to the museum's archives: "He 
jumped up and rushed about the room in a great state of excitement and to the 
astonishment of those present began to undress himself."</span></p>

huge 'Cleopatra temple' block from sea</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A huge granite block thought to have 
once formed part of a temple pillar in a sunken palace of Cleopatra has been 
raised from the sea at Alexandria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The nine-tonne stone, said to be from a 
temple to the goddess Isis, was lifted by crane out of the waters which have 
covered the palace for centuries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was cut from a slab of red granite 
quarried in Aswan, some 1,100km (700 miles) to the south, officials say.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There are plans to exhibit it in a new 
museum devoted to the sunken city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Earthquakes are thought to have toppled 
the city in the 4th Century.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"This is one of the most important 
archaeological finds in Alexandria, among the 400 items recovered by the Greek 
archaeological team that has been engaged in underwater research since 1998," 
Egyptian Culture Minister Faruq Hosni said at the scene.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Laborious operation</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cleopatra's palace and other buildings 
and monuments lie strewn on the seabed in harbour of Alexandria, the country's 
second-largest city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In recent years, excavators have 
discovered dozens of sphinxes in the harbour, along with pieces of what is 
believed to be the Alexandria Lighthouse, or Pharos, which was one of the seven 
wonders of the ancient world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The block is the first major artefact 
extracted from the harbour since 2002, when authorities banned further removal 
of major objects from the sea for fear it would damage them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was discovered by a Greek expedition 
in 1998.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To retrieve it, divers had to spend 
weeks cleaning it of mud and scum before dragging it across the sea floor for 
three days to bring it closer to the harbour's edge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A lorry stood by to ferry the block to a 
freshwater tank where it will lie for six months until all the salt, which acts 
as a preservative underwater but damages it once exposed, is dissolved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Zahi Hawas, Egypt's top archaeologist 
said the block was unique.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We believe it was part of the complex 
surrounding Cleopatra's palace," he was quoted by The Associated Press as saying 
as he watched the block being brought ashore.</span></p>

history resurfaces</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After 14 centuries, a giant monolith 
from a submerged temple was raised from the seabed in Alexandria last week, 
Nevine El-Aref watched the dramatic recovery</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was more activity than usual in 
Alexandria's Eastern Harbour last week as a team working offshore made 
preparations to ready the dock for the unloading of a giant piece of history. An 
enormous yellow crane stood ready to lift a pylon, or ceremonial entrance tower, 
belonging to the Ptolemaic temple of Isis Lochias which has been under the sea 
for 14 centuries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meanwhile, five underwater 
archaeologists in diving gear were inspecting the planned route on the seabed 
along which pylon tower would be moved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The event was watched by 1,000 or so 
Egyptian and international journalists, TV anchors, photographers and producers 
as well as curious local people. It was planned that the media observe the event 
from the deck of a yacht, however, this wasn't possible due to the bad weather 
that hit Alexandria</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The weather also interfered with plans 
for raising the pylon. After mud and scum which clung to the surface of the 
pylon, a huge, single block of granite was removed, the monolith was dragged 
across the seabed for three days from its original position at Shaba to bring it 
closer to the harbour edge for its final extraction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At 2pm sharp the crane moved, and 
onlookers had their first glimpse of this hitherto virtually unseen piece of 
Ptolemaic architecture. Weighing nine tonnes and at 2.25 metres tall, the pylon 
looked beautiful as it surfaced, touching the air for the first time since the 
shoreline collapsed and the sea moved in at some time around the seventh century 
BC. The piece was a single slab cut from the red-granite quarries of Aswan and 
was once part of Isis Lochias Temple, which was located alongside Queen 
Cleopatra's intended mausoleum in the sunken Royal Quarter beneath the waters of 
Alexandria's Eastern Harbour.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After being raised and safely brought 
ashore, the pylon tower was transported to the Roman theatre where it will be 
fully cleaned and restored in preparation for becoming the centerpiece of an 
underwater museum which will eventually be constructed offshore in the Stanley 
area of Alexandria. The museum will exhibit more than 200 objects raised from 
the Mediterranean seabed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"This is an important part of 
Alexandria's history and it brings us closer to knowing more about the ancient 
city," said Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, who was present at the event. He 
described the pylon tower as unique among Alexandria's antiquities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The pylon was not discovered until 1998, 
when it was found along with 400 other artefacts by a Greek archaeological 
mission working with divers from the Underwater Archaeology Department in 
Alexandria. At the time they were conducting a comprehensive archaeological 
survey in the coastal area of Shatbi.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The pylon is the first submerged 
artefact to be lifted out of the sea since 2002, when the Supreme Council of 
Antiquities (SCA) prohibited the removal of any submerged objects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Zahi Hawass, secretary-general of the 
SCA, explained that behind prohibiting the extraction of submerged historical 
pieces were two reasons. On the one hand, the SCA is conducting an extensive 
archaeological and cultural project with UNESCO to study all the procedures 
necessary to build a new underwater museum in Alexandria. On the other hand, 
extracting further pieces would require more time as would the cleaning of the 
objects from accumulated salts</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the planned museum is in place, 
visitors will be able to enjoy an underwater tour walking along special tunnels 
among the various sunken objects. "If the study shows it's possible, this could 
become a magical place, both above and underwater," Hawass said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"If you smell the sea here, it means 
that you are smelling the history of ancient Alexandria," Hawass told Al-Ahram 
Weekly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ibrahim Darwish, head of museums in 
Alexandria and one of the archaeologist-divers, said the tower was part of an 
entrance to a temple dedicated to Isis Lochias and was located on Cape Lochias. 
According to ancient sources, Cleopatra's mausoleum stood near this temple. A 
door lintel and a coin bearing the image of a similar tower were among objects 
discovered there in 1998.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologist Harry Tzalas, who headed 
the 1998 underwater archaeological mission, told the Weekly that the lifted 
pylon was the most important artefact found in the submerged Royal Quarter as it 
is a symbol of an amalgamation of Greek and Pharaonic architectural styles. 
Tzalas pointed out that since the pylon, which is cut in the ancient Egyptian 
architectural style, was found at the entrance of the Greek temple of Isis 
Lochias, and shows that some of the monuments of Alexandria were not only in the 
Graeco-Roman style but Pharaonic as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although the Eastern Harbour is the 
place where Mark Anthony died after being defeated by Octavian, and where 
Cleopatra tragically ended her life, Tzalas said, the couple were not buried 
there. He explained that the Cleopatra mausoleum was being built near the Isis 
temple but was not ready when she died, and she was not buried there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Hellenic Institute for Ancient and 
Mediaeval Alexandrian Studies has carried out 13 underwater archaeological 
surveys in Alexandria since 1998. The area of study extends for 14km east of the 
promontory of Silsileh (ancient Cape Lochias), to the peninsula of Montazah 
(ancient Taposiris Parva). The surveys focussed on a series of sites that were 
detected by preliminary diving and through the use of a side-scan sonar device.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At Shatbi, where the pylon was found, 
many architectural elements made of granite, each weighing several tonnes, have 
also been discovered. It appears clear that the archaeologist- divers are 
working on part of the submerged Royal Quarter that, in Ptolemaic times, among 
other buildings was a palace sanctuary of Isis and the mausoleum of Cleopatra.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This site is adjacent to the submerged 
eastern contour of the Royal Quarter that was partially located on the 
promontory, having at its tip the temple of Isis Lochias. Man-made targets were 
detected during the side scan sonar survey. Some deep-water targets can be 
interpreted as shipwrecks (it must be assessed whether these are ancient or 
modern wrecks), while others may indicate man-made structures. The mission's 
fifth and sixth campaigns were most rewarding, as divers were able to work very 
near the tip of the cape due to the favourable weather. Several architectural 
elements, most made of red granite, were found scattered on the sea floor at a 
depth of seven metres. Most important because of their size are three very large 
pieces weighing several tonnes each: a complete pedestal; part of the framing of 
a gigantic door preserved up to a length of 3.6 metres; and a complete 
architectural element that was part of a pylon 2.6 metres high. This 
architectural element is of particular interest because it is known that in 
Ptolemaic times such monumental entrances were placed in front of temples to 
imitate the Pharaonic style, and this piece was found in the immediate vicinity 
where it is known that the temple of Isis Lochias stood. Another 10 smaller 
architectural elements made of granite were also found there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the coastal area extending 
immediately south of the first site, aerial photography has clearly shown man- 
made structures in the shallows near the beach. In the immediate vicinity north 
of these structures, in deeper waters, side-scan sonar has detected a number of 
abnormalities on the seabed of elongated contours running parallel to the cape. 
There is also a line of structures parallel to the coast. The depth varies from 
one to five metres. During the mission's fifth and sixth campaigns, two trenches 
were dug in the sand under the stilt on which the Shatbi Casino stands. Numerous 
pottery shards, most dating to the Late Roman period, as well as small broken 
pieces of marble and granite, were recovered. The excavation will be resumed in 
the future, in order to establish if, as it is believed, the Casino stands on 
the ruins of the Martyrium of St Mark, a revered monument dating from the fourth 
century AD.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They were one of the world's most famous 
couples, who lived lives of power and glory – but who spent their last hours in 
despair and confusion. Now, more than 2,000 years since Antony and Cleopatra 
walked the earth, historians believe they may finally have solved the riddle of 
their last hours together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A team of Greek marine archaeologists 
who have spent years conducting underwater excavations off the coast of 
Alexandria in Egypt have unearthed a giant granite threshold to a door that they 
believe was once the entrance to a magnificent mausoleum that Cleopatra VII, 
queen of the Egyptians, had built for herself shortly before her death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They believe the 15-tonne antiquity 
would have held a seven metre-high door so heavy that it would have prevented 
the queen from consoling her Roman lover before he died, reputedly in 30BC.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"As soon as I saw it, I thought we are 
in the presence of a very special piece of a very special door," Harry Tzalas, 
the historian who heads the Greek mission, said. "There was no way that such a 
heavy piece, with fittings for double hinges and double doors, could have moved 
with the waves so there was no doubt in my mind that it belonged to the 
mausoleum. Like Macedonian tomb doors, when it closed, it closed for good."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Tzalas believes the discovery of the 
threshold sheds new light on an element of the couple's dying hours which has 
long eluded historians.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the first century AD the Greek 
historian Plutarch wrote that Mark Antony, after being wrongly informed that 
Cleopatra had killed herself, had tried to take his own life. When the dying 
general expressed his wish to pass away alongside his mistress, who was hiding 
inside the mausoleum with her ladies-in-waiting, he was "hoisted with chains and 
ropes" to the building's upper floor so that he could be brought in to the 
building through a window.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Plutarch wrote, "when closed the 
[mausoleum's] door mechanism could not open again". The discovery in the 
Mediterranean Sea of such huge pieces of masonry at the entrance to what is 
believed to be the mausoleum would explain the historian's line. Tzalas said: 
"For years, archaeologists have wondered what Plutarch, a very reliable 
historian, meant by that. And now, finally, I think we have the answer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Allowing a dying man to be hoisted on 
ropes was not a very nice, or comforting thing to do, but Cleopatra couldn't do 
otherwise. She was there only with females and they simply couldn't open such a 
heavy door."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The threshold, part of the sunken palace 
complex in which Cleopatra is believed to have died, was discovered recently at 
a depth of eight metres but only revealed this week. It has yet to be brought to 
the surface.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The archaeologists have also recovered a 
nine-tonne granite block which they believe formed part of a portico belonging 
to the adjoining temple of Isis Lochias. "We believe it was part of the complex 
surrounding Cleopatra's palace," said Zahi Hawas, Egypt's top archaeologist. 
"This is an important part of Alexandria's history and brings us closer to 
knowing more about the ancient city."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to Plutarch, who based his 
accounts largely on eyewitness testimonies, Antony died within seconds of laying 
eyes on his beloved queen and mother of his children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cleopatra, the most powerful woman of 
her day and Egypt's most fabled ruler, is believed to have taken her own life 
just days later, legend has it with the aid of an asp.</span></p>

legendary general Cao Cao unearthed in central China</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tomb of Cao Cao, a renowned warlord 
and politician in the third century, was unearthed in Anyang City of central 
China's Henan Province, archaeologists said Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cao Cao (155-220 A.D.), who built the 
strongest and most prosperous state during the Three Kingdom period (208-280 
A.D.), is remembered for his outstanding military and political talents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cao Cao is also known for his poems that 
reflected his strong character. Some of the poems are included in China's middle 
school textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Three ancient corpses, one man and two 
women, were found in the two-chamber tomb in Xigaoxue village of Anyang. The man 
was found to have died in his sixties, which coincides the age of Cao Cao when 
he died, Liu Qingzhu, director of the academic committee of Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences, told a press conference in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">More than 250 articles, made of gold, 
silver, pottery and etc, were unearthed from the 740-square-meter tomb, a size 
appropriate for a king. Archaeologists also found 59 engraved stone plates 
logging the name and amount of the articles buried in the tomb. Seven of the 
plates logged weapons "often used by the king of Wei", or Cao Cao, Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Also unearthed were a large amount of 
paintings drawn on stone plates, Liu added.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cao Cao wrote in his will that his 
burial place should be simple, which corresponds to the fact that the walls of 
the tome were not painted and few precious articles were found, said Hao Benxing, 
head of Henan's Institute of Archaeology.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The position of the tomb is in line with 
historical recordings and ancient books from Cao Cao's time, Hao added.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although further excavations are yet to 
be carried out, current evidences are adequate to prove this is Cao Cao's tomb, 
said Guan Qiang, director of the archaeology department of China's State 
Administration of Cultural Heritage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tomb had been raided for several 
times before archaeologists started to excavate it in Dec. 2008, Guan said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The police are working to retrieve the 
stolen articles, he added.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The governments of Henan and Anyang are 
planning to display the tomb to the public, Hao said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">ARCHAEOLOGISTS have discovered a stone 
cross estimated to be over 700 years old in a remote spot on Dartmoor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is thought to have once served as a 
Christian waymarker or boundary stone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The team, led by Win Scutt and Ross Dean 
of City College Plymouth, stumbled on the cross when surveying the ruins of a 
medieval settlement on the slopes of Gutter Tor, Dartmoor. No longer upright, 
the cross was not identified until the last day of the survey.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We had assumed it was a gatepost until 
examining the shape of the stone and the incisions. We were bowled over when we 
realised what it actually was," said Win Scutt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although probably unfinished, the cross 
has been chiselled from a two metre long block of granite.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The head of the cross has three arms, 
while the shaft is decorated with a long incised channel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The cross lies close to the ruins of two 
medieval long houses that date to the same period.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The survey was being carried out as part 
of a training exercise for students on the University of Plymouth's Foundation 
Degree in Archaeological Practice.</span></p>
