</p><center><h2>MUSCLE PAIN HEALING TESTIMONIALS FOR VITACEL PROCAINE SUPPLEMENTS</h2></center><p align="justify"> 

On July 10, 1978, 6 1/2 long years ago, I became ill. It seemed to happen overnight. When I left my office on that day, I didn’t realize that 1 would never return or that I was just starting two of the most frightening experiences of my life. <br><br>

My symptoms were: face was swollen, my extended fingers were so swollen that they touched the sides of each other - they looked like sausages. I had muscle pain and ached all over. Within days, my feet and ankles swelled to the point that I could hardly walk, my eye-sight diminished almost immediately, no appetite, hair falling out, rapid heartbeats (I thought I was having a heart attack). Any exertion caused utter complete exhaustion - my days began to follow the same schedule - take a shower, take a nap; fix breakfast, take a nap; answer the phone, take a nap; visit with a friend, take a nap (sometimes while they were still visiting!).<br><br>

My doctor felt that I may have a collagen disease, but tests were inconclusive. My husband took me to Mayo Clinic twice, again, <b>tests were inconclusive</b>. No one seemed to have any answers - at least none that they were sharing with me. I started reading medical books and case histories, but had to stop as I was showing symptoms of everything in the book. <br><br>

I changed doctors on the local level, and finally (almost 18 months later) we had several diag­noses. <b>“Lupus” - “Raynaud’s Syndrome” - “Camel Tunnelism”</b>. - . nothing I had ever heard of-couldn’t be too bad, right? Wrong. I didn’t feel any better, but at least I knew why Auto-immune disease, my body was its own enemy. The <b>swelling was from inflammation</b> throughout my body -don’t forget, it had an 18 month head start and to counteract the swelling, my doctor administered <b>Cortisone</b> treatment. It didn’t help much with my disease, and the <b>side effects were horrendous</b>. First side effect, which I had been warned would happen, was a rapid weight gain. Fifty two pounds in six months!! How’s that for rapid? I was still exhausted and could barely walk.<br><br> 

My life had been totally turned around. I went from an energetic, “on the go” individual mother of five, grandmother of one, to a near invalid. I had to retire from a job that I loved -Executive Secre­tary of the Chicago Marriott O’Hare Hotel. - AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE GOOD NEWS! <br><br>

Three years later, on March 28, 1982, my 18 year old daughter, Meg, was involved in an auto­mobile accident. A backseat passenger, she had a head injury and lay in a coma for two months. At that point, my stress level went through the roof. It took me at least that long to scrape myself off the ceiling. We never left her We were told that she would die. Then, when she didn’t die, we were told that she would be a vegetable. It was then that I discovered the doctors didn’t know any more about brain damage than I did. In fact, I had the advantage, I loved her! We talked to her - we helped to pattern her - we stimulated her. Our efforts paid off-she started the long slow process of coming out of the coma. We had to teach her how to eat, talk, brush her teeth, walk - it was like having a 125 lb. newborn. I don’t need to tell you - THIS WAS THE BAD NEWS!<br><br> 

During all this time, I was barely making it. I seemed to be on a merry-go-round that wouldn’t slow down, and I couldn’t get off’. I was trying to learn as much about Lupus and head injuries as I could. I’ve always felt that if you’re going to live with a killer, you should get to know him pretty well, it was about this time that I learned about <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">Vitacel GH3</a>. I admit I was grasping at straws, but nothing seemed to be helping me. I went to a meeting/seminar, not expecting much. I listened and watched as a lot of people got up and gave <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/home.html">testimonials</a> of how GH3 <b>had helped them</b>. I heard about <b>high blood pressure, depres­sion, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, colon problems</b>.<br><br> 

HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ONE SUPPLEMENT WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR SO MANY VARIED ILLNESSES? And yet, <b>the people seemed to be sincere</b>. I was assured that it wouldn’t hurt me and that it might help. <b>I’m a skeptic</b>, but felt that if GH3 did just one quarter for me what it seemed to do for the people at the seminar, <b>it was worth a try</b>. I borrowed some tablets, <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/shippingpolicy.html">placed an order</a> and slowly <b>began my health turn around</b>. <br><br>

I was so busy with Meg that in the beginning I didn’t realize any difference. But, by the end of three months, I noticed I wasn’t so tired. I wasn’t taking naps each day. Sometimes I would go for two weeks without having to take a nap. It was so gradual, I didn’t even know when it happened. I was sleeping soundly during the night after many years of restlessness. Some of my sense of humor was back, I wasn’t so <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/depression.html">depressed</a>. <b>Within a year</b> my eye-sight was better. I never used glasses prior to the Lupus flare, but couldn’t read anything without them after my illness. My hair is thicker and fuller and I lost sonic the gray (a bonus!). No more elevated temperatures, no more leg cramps, no more pain in the muscles and joints. I function very well in all areas.<br><br> 

I very slowly weaned myself off Cortisone (an action I don’t advocate for anyone). I was off cortisone for almost a year before I discussed it with my doctor. He didn’t argue with success. The real kicker came when I realized that it had been almost a year since I had seen the doctor. I made an appointment and he went over me thoroughly - several days later he called with my test results. All tests were normal. I was elated. He was amazed!<br><br>

Meg also takes Vitacel and it has helped her <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/depression.html">depression</a>. She made three <b>attempts to destroy her life</b> prior to GH3
 and has made none since. She was told that she would never walk without an aid (cane or crutches). She walks by herself They said that what she didn’t have back within a year, she would never get back. She is still progressing. She handles her own checkbook, does her own shop­ping, is starting to drive - and is alive and intelligent.<br><br> 

I realize that we all take our daily life for granted. We always know when we were happy, and we always know when we did feel good. It’s quite a shock when “feeling good and being happy” disappear!<br><br> 

I still go to meetings and I still hear people tell how much GH-3 had helped their <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/arthritis.html">arthritis</a>, etc. GH3 <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/howitworksmore.html"> works at the cellular level</a> and seems to get the job done. THIS IS THE ONLY LIFE WE GET - AND THIS IS THE ONLY BODY WE GET TO LIVE IT IN. DO YOUR BODY A FAVOR, GIVE IT Vitacel GH3.</p>

ALLERGIES - ECZEMA - MUSCULAR CRAMPS </h2></font></center><p align="justify"><font size="3" color="#FF9900"> </font>

January 1985 <br><br>

<b>For 38 years</b> I have fought <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/arthritis2.html">arthritis</a>, which started in my hands and then spread, at various times, to my neck, back, knees, and hips. Shots or injections, such as gold shots, Cortisone, or Novocaine were of no help or brought only temporary relief. Medications such as Indocin, Prednisone, Motrin, and most recently Naproxyn caused gastric distress resulting in three (3) gastric hemorrhages that required blood transfusions. The last hemorrhage put me in intensive care. After that, I was told to take only Ecotrin in conjunction with food. This gave no relief to the painful left thigh muscles and hip even though I was taking at least eight (8) tablets in a 24 hour period. Neat and cold therapy, plus ultra­sound, brought no relief. Only Tylenol with Codeine gave some lessening of distress. Pain developed in any sitting or lying position. Walking was painful, even with the use of a cane. <br><br>

             Doctors ruled out <b>hip surgery</b>, saying I was a poor surgical risk since I had vascular problems in the past. However, in March 1984, my orthopedist injected <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/evolution.html">procaine</a> into my left hip. Then, while in the X-ray department under a fluoroscope, Procaine was injected directly into the hip socket. The pain immediately lessened and I could walk without a cane. However, these injections did not have a lasting effect. <br><br>

A neighbor, Lorraine Phelps, noted my improvement and introduced me to Vitacel GH3, which I started taking in May, 1984. I also take <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">Vitacel 4</a> for my <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/cholesterol.html">high cholesterol</a>. It required three months for the hip and thigh pain to disappear and somewhat longer for the other ailments. The effect on high cholesterol is still in a trial period. Now, I have ceased the use of all medications for arthritis as well as Tagamet for stomach distress and anti-histamines (taken for seven (7) years). The<a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/eczema.html">eczema</a>.  on my fingers has disap­peared plus I do not suffer <b>muscular cramps on my legs of soles of my feet</b>. I feel great! In October and November of 1984, I spent a month in Australia and New Zealand without problems.<br><br> 

         Thanks to all of those involved in producing and telling everyone of Vitacel supplements. . I, for one, will be <b>forever grateful</b> for the <b>boost to a comfortable life, free of pain and health problems</b> and without all the side effects of other treatments. </p>

PAIN FROM PREVIOUSLY DAMAGED MUSCLES </h2></font></center><p align="justify"><font size="3" color="#FF9900"> </font> 

            I was first introduced to <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">GH3</a> in the fall of 1982. Ron and Marcie Abraham of Seattle sent us informa­tion about GH-3 and told of all the wonderful things it had done for Margie. I read the information (I thought with an open mind). “Baloney” I said, and filed the material in “File 13.” I felt that there wasn’t a <b>product in the entire world that could do that much for that many different ailments</b> without it being a drug. In the fall of 1983, we traveled to Seattle to visit Ron and Marcie, and <b>I became a believer</b>! It had been three years since our last visit, and I could not believe the change in Marcie! Vitacel had given Marcie a <b>new lease on life</b>, and I felt <b>it was worth a try</b>.<br><br>

         I wanted to see if GH3 would do anything for my <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/bursitis.html">bursitis</a>. The <b>pain from the bursitis</b> was so bad, it was very difficult to lift my arms in the morning to brush my hair. I feel very strongly against drugs, so I resigned myself to the fact that the pain was something that I would just have to live with. Sleeping was difficult because there wasn’t a painless position to be found. I would sometimes awaken with a terrible pain, and my right shoulder muscle would be locked. I couldn’t move. My husband would have to grasp my wrist and jerk my arm to unlock my shoulder. If my shoulder muscle would lock when my husband was working (he works nights), I would have to grit my teeth, slide to the edge of the bed, fall to the floor and fling my shoulder into the unlocked position. <br><br>

Five days into Vitacel vitamin therapy, I enjoyed the first night of restful sleep in years! The pain was bearable! It was into the second month of Vitacel that the <b>pain of the bursitis disappeared</b> and has not returned. It’s beautiful! <br><br>

I began Vitacel GH3  because of my bursitis, but other wonderful things have happened too. When I was about five years old, Iran my arm through a wringer of a washing machine. The arm went through the wringer completely to my shoulder until my mother rescued me. There were no broken bones, but the <b>muscles</b> in my lower arm were <b>severely damaged</b>, leaving me with a lumpy arm. As I got older, the arm would ache when the humidity rose, and it would sometimes go numb, causing me to drop what­ever I was holding. Thank God, it was never a cup of hot coffee! There has been no numbness or ache in the arm in the past year.<br><br> 

For the past 19 years, I have been <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allergies2.html">allergic</a> to the sun. I had to cover all exposed skin before venturing outdoors. The allergy would cause bumps that would itch, break open and leave sears. It was really miserable. I read a GH3 <b>testimony</b> where relief from allergies was experienced and I decided to test myself I ventured out into the hot Montana summer sun with a lot of skin exposed, worked in the yard all day, and nothing happened! No bumps! Later that evening, some bumps did appear, but they didn’t itch and they left no scars! Maybe in the summer of 1985 the bumps won’t even appear. I can hardly wait! The entire summer of 1984 was a repeat of my first attempt to see if GH-3 helped my allergy. It was great! <br><br>

I can’t say enough for Vitacel GH3. I’ll never be without it. We figure that the <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/pricelist.html"> the cost of GH3</a>, is about the price of a dinner out a month. So we’ve decided that feeling great is worth the price of one less dinner out during the month.</p>

</p><center><h2>MUSCULAR PROBLEMS - HEART ATTACK<br>
NARCOLEPSY -  SENILITY – MUSCULAR KNOTS </h2></center><p align="justify">

November 14, 1982 <br><br>

On October 15, 1978, I had a <b>heart attack</b> on October 16, I also had a second one. I have a 25% blockage in my heart. 1 only have three cylinders, so if you’ve ever seen anybody operate on three cylinders, that’s me. From the time I got out of the hospital, which was about a month later, until I started taking <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">GH3</a>. I had chest pains daily. I would have them so bad sometimes that my arms would get numb all the way down into my hand. I was in San Diego last winter and a lady down there had been to Romania for the shot treatments. I thought she was in her late 40’s or early 50’s and found out she was 65. She said I should get on these Vitacel pills. Being a <b>doubting Thomas</b> like I am, I didn’t do it right away We came to Spokane in April and my wife and <b>I finally decided to try it</b>.<br><br> 

I swear from the first pill that I took, I knew that I was taking it. I had a flushed feeling. I do still occasionally get a very small chest pain, but it’s nothing like I used to get. I’m not having any numb­ness in my arms at all since I’ve been taking it and I’ve been taking it since the latter part of May.<br><br> 

I also have another disease known as Narcolepsy. That means I can go to sleep anytime, any­where, standing up, sitting down or lying down. I had it when I was in the Air force, and I told the doctors about it from 1968 until I retired; and the Flight Surgeon would just slap me on the back and say, “Get out of here, Fox. There’s nothing wrong with you.” When I got out of the service, my wife was reading a magazine and there was an article in it on Narcolepsy; and she said, “I think this is what you’ve got.” So I took it out to the base to the doctor and said, “Hey, this is what I’ve got.” He read it and said, “Mm-hm. You might have it. Tell me about it.” So I gave him all the symptoms. They sent me to the neurosurgeon and put me through tests that probably cost the government $5,000 or $6,000. The neurosurgeon said, “Yes, you’re a textbook ease. You’ve got it.” So they put me on 40 milligrams a day of Ritalin, which is speed, legalized speed. At the time, my wife told me, “If you’re going to take that stuff, I’m going to leave.” So we gradually reduced that and we got it down to about 20 milligrams a day Now, I filled my last prescription on April 24th, which is a month’s supply, that’s all they will give you. I’ve still got enough for about 15 days. So that’s how much I’ve taken since then.<br><br> 

             So those are the two things it’s worked for with me. I have a <b>78 year old mother-in-law</b> that we put on it at the same time. I brought her to Spokane in August, 1980, and she’d been here nearly two years and had no knowledge of it. She was totally and <b>completely senile</b>. She didn’t know what day it was or what time it was. The only thing she could remember was her birthday. She’s now very alert mentally She can tell you what day it is, where she is, what month it is and so forth. She knows exactly what’s going on. She knows what’s going on to the point now that she’s like a little child in that she vies for attention like a child does; and she plans different things so that they’ll come out and she’ll get her way.<br><br> 

My wife went on it at the same time. She was involved in a very bad automobile accident in 1978 and had her right leg pushed up in her hip area. She was taking therapy from a physical therapist, and had been for a longtime, for what they call muscular knots. She had injections to relax the muscles in that area. Since she’s been taking Vitacel supplements, she hasn’t been back to the doctor at all; and she <b>hasn’t had any problems with muscular knotting</b> whatsoever. In conjunction with taking the GH-3, we belong to a family fitness center and she’s been taking physical exercises. They have you take aquatic exercises when you have this kind of muscular problem, and she’s doing exercises now that she was not able to do before.</p>

</p><center><h2>MUSCLE STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT IN ELDERLY </h2></center></font><p align="justify"><font color="#333399" face="arial" size="2"> </font> 

Aloha!<br><br> 

August25, 1989 <br><br>

It has been about 3 weeks since my family has started taking <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">Vitacel GH7</a>. There are so <b>many things</b> I want to share with you about how this &gt;b&gt;vitamin nutrient has worked for us. Having had active, healthy grandparents for as long as I can remember, I guess I sort of took it for granted that they would always be that way. Well, in the past 4 years, things just started to go downhill for them. I’ve been taking care of them since February of this year and these are the improvements they’ve made so far: <br><br>

<b>ENDURANCE</b> - Grandma has a hard time walking even with a walker so we put her on a treadmill so she’ll get some exercise instead of sitting or riding around all day Before GH7 after 2 minutes, she’d want to get off saying that she was sore and she was going to cry, etc, etc. After I day on GH7, she was able to go for 10 minutes without any complaints. She even walked down the hallway without her walker, singing!<br><br> 

<b>MUSCLE STRENGTH</b> - Grandma’s back and stomach muscles were really shot AND SHE WAS EXPERIENCING SEVERE MUSCLE PAIN. Things like getting her out of bed, putting her in or out of the car and even taking a bath on a special chair was quite difficult as she would always say, “I cannot” or “I’m falling.” Now she’s able to hold herself enough so she can get out of bed by herself, get into the car and take a bath with less help.<br><br> 

<b>DISPOSITION</b> Her attitude is happier now. She smiles more and laughs more. When she does have pain at night, she’s very apologetic whereas before, she’d be screaming or yelling to no end accusing me of awful things.<br><br> 

<b>FEELING WARMTH</b> - For the first time since I’ve been taking care of her, she can feel warmth. She used to always be cold, always wearing long sleeves and a long jacket even in our tropical weather while everyone else is perspiring! Now she says that she’s warm she wears short sleeves and she perspires. The other night when my mom felt chilly because of the cool night air and asked her to roll the car window up, she replied, “I’m not too cold.” <br><br>

<b>GRAY HAIR TURNING DARK</b> - Both Grandma and Grandpa have dark hair now where I know wasn’t there prior to <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">Vitacel 7</a>. Grandma’s eyebrows are all dark now when they used to be all gray and Grandpa’s bush eyebrows are half dark when they too used to be all gray.<br><br> 

<b>DISCOLORING OF FEET &amp; CALVES</b> - Both their feet and half of their calves had become a black purplish color. Doctors had said there was nothing that could be done. Their feet and calves are slowly becoming their natural color, the back purplish color has left and you can see shades of pink coming through.<br><br> 

<b>ARTHRITIS</b> - Grandma can open and close her hands without difficulty now making it easier to play the ukulele!<br><br>

<b>MORE ENERGY</b> - Having four children under eight years of age and now two grand­parents to care for, I need all the energy I can get. Thanks to GH7.   I can get through the day without dragging through it. I even <b>feel good after exercising</b> whereas before I would exercise for one hour and then sleep for three to recuperate! <br><br>

<b>WEIGHT LOSS</b> - So far I’ve lost 7 pounds. My appetite has decreased and I exercise more because I feel more energetic. Believe me I’m not complaining! <br><br>

<b>LIGHTER MENSTRUAL FLOW</b> - My periods were very heavy before, so much so that I was anemic because of all the blood I’d loose. Now it’s as if time has turned back to when I was a teenager. Although the pain was still there, I felt that in time my body will he free of that also since [never experienced pain with my periods until after the birth of my fourth child three years ago. <br><br>

<b>TICKS &amp; FLEAS</b> - Not me, my dog! Every time I’d wash him, being an outside dog, he’d have ticks and fleas galore! Well, after only one tablet, I washed him and found maybe 5 ticks and 4 fleas all dead! Now I’ve also been giving him brewer’s yeast which someone told me would keep the ticks and fleas away Although it had not worked on him, I just kept giving it to him hoping one day it might. So whether it was Vitacel 7 alone or GH7 opening up the cells so it could now take in the brewer’s yeast, I don’t know. But I do know <b>this could never have happened without</b> GH7.  !<br><br>

Are we excited about it? You bet. Things that our family lived with for years began to reverse itself within a few weeks. Even if it took a few months, it would still be worth every cent a hundred times over!<br><br> 

You’ll never know unless you try it for yourself and see what it can do for you and your loved ones. I’d be happy to talk to anyone concerning my experiences as I’d only be too happy to help.<br><br>

Here’s to your great health!!!! </p>

</p><center><h2>HEALING MUSCULAR PROBLEMS</h2></center><p align="justify">

What I have to share with you is <b>nothing short of an awakening</b>! My sister, who has a brain injury from birth; my roommate, who has severe cerebral palsy; and myself, who suffers from arthritis, phlebitis, colitis and severe dermatitis (that I feel has progressed to psoriasis), as well as having had several bad back injuries, all began taking <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/allproducts.html">GH7</a> in February of 1988. We all noted remarkable changes in our lives. We felt better in every way. We had more energy, needed less sleep, had no more bouts with depression, experienced no more pain from arthritis, and my phlebitis disappeared. I had no more bouts with colitis, and a bonus . . . my hair started coming in black again! Friends noted how much brighter my sister was and how well she was progressing. Indeed! She progressed from February to December through two complete developmental stages and is continuing to progress. We felt so good that it was easy to forget how rotten we had felt before GH7.<br><br>

When money began to be short and we were scraping to be able to afford to move to a better location, we let ourselves off the GH7 and had been off it since December Oh, what a mistake that was. Our move was the most horrible of all we could imagine. The stress was greater than it had ever been before. My roommate mentioned to me, “It’s too bad we got off GH7. Oh, <b>how right she was</b>. It was then that we realized how much we had given up when we let it go. We will never be without it again! <br><br>

My roommate’s balance improves and she had no more cramping of her muscles and no more pain from her arthritis. My sister did not complain of hurts either. The memory problem that my sister and my roommate had was greatly improved, and so was mine! I also had people who had not seen mc for ages tell me how much younger I looked. And they had remembered me from six or so year ago! I know, now, that we will make sure we have GH7 on hand, always. God really blessed us when my friend introduced me to GH7 and we don’t intend to be without those blessings again. We are sharing it with our neighbors here in our new place, and we hope to see their <b>success with</b> GH7 too.<br><br> 

Thank you, <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/drkochmore.html">Dr. Koch</a>, <b>for producing such a fine and wonderful product</b>. I was sorry to learn that <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/evolution.html">Dr Ana Aslan</a>, the discoverer of Gerovital H3, the forerunner of the improved Vitacel GH7, had passed on. It would have been nice if she could have lived to see GH3 acclaimed, as well as learned what Dr. Koch had developed by expanding and improving on her formula. I believe that its true value should be known <a href="http://www.cellhealthmakeover.com/shippingpolicy.html">World-Wide</a>. I am very happy, however, that the demise of Dr Aslan has not inhibited our access to GH7. Thank you again. </p>

Sincerely, <br><br>
