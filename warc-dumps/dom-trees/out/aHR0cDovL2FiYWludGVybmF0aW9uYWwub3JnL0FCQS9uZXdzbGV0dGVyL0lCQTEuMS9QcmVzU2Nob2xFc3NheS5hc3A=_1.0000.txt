   	<h2>The Human Response to Climate Change and the Role of Behavior Analysis</h2>
    <h4 class="notopspace">Presidential Scholar Essay</h4>
    <p class="notopspace">By Melissa J. Allman

	</p><p>At this year’s Presidential Scholar Address at the annual
meeting for the Association for Behavior Analysis
International, Dr. Lonnie Thompson, Distinguished
Professor of Earth Sciences and world renowned
paleoclimatologist, discussed the human response to global
climate change. Dr. Thompson’s research has revealed
that global warming and glacier retreat are occurring at
unprecedented levels, a claim substantiated by his work
reconstructing and compositing data obtained from drilled
ice cores that provides a 5,000 year window into the
past. The time to act is now, and the challenge is effect a
positive human response. The science of behavior analysis,
and in particular topics related to choice responding and
behavioral economics, may be useful in understanding
aspects of the human response to climate change and
effecting positive behavioral change. In Dr. Thompson’s
words “as a society we have three options: 1) prevention, 2)
adaptation, and 3) suffering.” At face value, this may seem
a clear choice; option 3 is least desirable and choice may
be directed towards 1 and 2. However all options share features which may account for why the “human response
to this issue is unclear.”</p>
    
	  <p>A variety of health—and lifestyle—related behaviors
have been studied by behavior analysts, and a common
feature of many is they are governed by short- and longterm
variables. Effecting behavior change in smokers is
a useful metaphor to understanding the human response
to climate change. Smokers for example, may favor
the immediate positive consequences of smoking, and
temporally discount the long-term negative consequences.
Ironically, if the negative consequences of smoking
behavior were more immediate, rates of abstinence (positive
behavior change) would likely increase. These principles
of behavior analysis likely underpin
certain efforts to make the negative
consequences of smoking more
salient (e.g., increased cost; pictures
of diseased lungs on cigarette packets
in Europe), which are effective in
reducing rates of target behaviors.
Essentially, the human response to
climate change is amenable to a similar
type of short- and long-term analysis.</p>
      
	<p>Short-term variables likely relate to everyday choices or
response allocation towards ‘greener’ alternatives, which
may involve both positive and negative consequences.
For instance, these alternatives may be unfamiliar (and
thus carry an unknown degree of risk), costly/effortful,
and violate current behavioral habits (which are difficult
to change). Social factors such as the desirability of the
response (and any impact on social status), compliance
with societal norms/trends, and individual morality may
also influence response allocation. Perhaps one way to
promote a positive response to climate change is to reduce
the perceived costs (and effort) associated with selecting
‘greener’ alternatives. For example, in the state of California
some cars are fuelled by liquid hydrogen; they are filled
up at regular gas stations, fuel costs are equivalent to gas,
and these vehicles look and perform like regular cars. It
is has been said of them, ‘they are the car of the future,
because they are so much like the car of today’. Principles of
behavioral economics predict that increasing the availability
of low-effort/cost, highly substitutable ‘greener’ alternatives
should shift response allocation towards these options
(particularly if the relative cost of the current response
increases). Matching law further dictates that more
responding tends to be allocated towards options that result
in higher rates of reinforcement, and increasing short-term
positive consequences of selecting ‘greener’ alternatives may
be beneficial.</p>
    
	<p>Long-term variables, in addition to delay discounting,
likely relate to the perceived consequences of global
climate and environmental change. Dr. Thompson’s
research demonstrates and further predicts loss of ice
cover, sea-level rise, changes in weather patterns, and
catastrophic effects on a variety of species, including
humans (his option 3). For most people, the notion of
‘polar ice-caps’ draws upon abstract, secondary experiences
(e.g., from television, books) as does ‘imagining’ the global
environmental consequences of climate change. Typically
direct, rather than indirect, experience with an outcome
better supports behavior. Although weather may be a ‘realworld’
observable marker of climate change, the extent to
which people associate their (individual and collective)
behavior with the weather is somewhat spurious. At the
individual level, there may also be a perceived lack of
contiguity between 1) current behavior and observable
‘real-world’ consequences to climate
change; and 2) ‘greener’ alternatives
and observable ‘real-world’
consequences (both positive, and the
prevention of negative). This lack of
contiguity is arguably one of the most
fundamental factors which mediate
the human response. The question
then becomes, how can ‘greener’
alternative behaviors be maintained
when they produce few observable consequences (and are
effectively, non-reinforced)?</p>
	
    <p>Shifting the human response towards ‘greener’
alternatives and maintaining positive behavior change is
a challenge for behavior analysis. Individual and societal
motivation needs to be sustained; much like a smoker who
has not yet experienced any adverse health consequences
of their behavior, people may be less motivated to change
to ‘greener’ alternatives if they have not perceived any
negative consequences of their behavior in the past. One
strategy may be to increase the salience of the long-term
consequences of climate change by emphasizing those cues
which are observable in the present; both positive (which
we may lose) and negative (which may get worse). This
type of effort was evidenced by the popular documentary
film <em>An Inconvenient Truth,</em> for which Dr. Thompson was a
consultant. Many of those in attendance at his Presidential
Scholar Address most likely felt like a smoker who has been
shocked into realizing they have a shadow on their lung: Dr.
Thompson’s address stressed the extent of global climate
change that can be witnessed today and the timely manner
in which humans must modify their behavior, and for which
the consequences of global climate change will be felt.</p>
    
	<p>Dr. Thompson’s research has revealed the extent of
current, and future, global climate change and this trend in
dramatic warming and melting is due to factors attributable
to our behavior. The challenge for behavior analysis is to
better understand the factors which underlie the human
response to climate change, and ultimately how this
response may be shifted to significantly alter the trajectory
of climate change in the future.</p>
