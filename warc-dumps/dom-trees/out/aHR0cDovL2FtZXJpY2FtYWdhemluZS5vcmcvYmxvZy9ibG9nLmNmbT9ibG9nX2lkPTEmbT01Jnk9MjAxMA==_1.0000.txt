	</p><p> Last week I was diagnosed with pneumonia;I had been tired for a few weeks, but had not suspected why I had been so lethargic, not to mention moribund and feverish. I am going to bow out of writing for the "Good Word" for the summer, though not from reading the blog, or the Word itself, as one means to help me to recuperate. I have come to love writing on the Scripture in this online context. Though blogs can have a tendency to get rough and ready, fesity and nasty, I think the Bible, even where readers disagree on meaning or interpretation, helps to calm things down and keeps readers, writers and commenters on an even keel. The Bible demands our humility and our love as the word of God and asks that we look even at current events with an eternal eye. I never get tired of reading the Bible - it just gets better and better - and I love writing about it and sharing it all with you. So if the pneuma has not moved me to rest, but pneumonia has, I nevertheless look forward to speaking with you all again in Fall, well-rested and re-inspired to talk Bible. In Christ,</p><br><p>

	<p style="margin: 8px 10px 22px 10px;">
	</p><p> Trinity Sunday gives us a wonderful moment to reflect on how mysterious God is, how little we can say no matter how vast our desire. It also prompts us to recall that cardinal Bible sin, idolatry: false claims about God, often overbalanced toward certainty and projection, i.e., making God too much like ourselves. John’s Gospel is the best place to find good language about the Trinity, while the Old Testament&nbsp; offers less, with today’s passage from Proverbs suggesting a partner for God, albeit a creaturely one. What I find more helpful is Karen Armstrong’s description of how the Eastern medieval tradition read Genesis 18. Let me offer that passage for reflection:</p><br><p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of the most famous icons of all times is The Old Testament Trinity by the fifteenth-century Russian painter Alexander Rublev...based on the story of Abraham and the three strangers, whom Rublev depicts as angels, messengers of the unknowable God. Each represents one of the Trinitarian “persons”; they look interchangeable and can be identified only by their symbolically colored garments and the emblem behind each one. Abraham’s table has become an altar, and the elaborate meal he prepared has been reduced to the Eucharistic cup. The three angels sit in a circle, emblem of perfection and infinity, and the viewer is positioned on the empty side of the table. Immediately Rublev suggests that Christians can experience the truth of the Trinity in the Eucharistic liturgy, in communion with God and one another, and—recalling the Genesis story—in a life of compassion. The central angel representing the Son immediately attracts our attention, yet he does not return our gaze but looks toward the Father, the angel on his right. Instead of returning his regard, the Father directs his attention to the figure at the right of the painting, whose gaze is directed within. We are thus drawn into the perpetual circling motion described by Gregory of Nazianzus. This is not an overbearing deity, demanding exclusive loyalty and total attention to himself. We meet not of the <em>prosopoi</em> [persons] head-on; each refers us to the other in eternal personal dispossession. There is no selfhood in the Trinity. Instead there is silence and <em>kenosis</em> [emptying of self].” (Karen Armstrong, <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.amazon.com/Case-God-Karen-Armstrong/dp/0307269183/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274817758&amp;sr=1-1" ..... <a>Read more</a>

	</p><p> If you have ever lived overseas for a period of time, or travelled overseas, you might have experienced the strange phenomenon of picking up whatever pop song was popular at the time and having it stand as your musical memory of a country, though its impact might have been fleeting even in the country of its origin. For me, the song is <em><a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3Q-b-blfk&amp;feature=related">Niente Paura</a>, </em>by Ligabue, whose Italian lyrics I do not understand, except the title: “nothing to fear,” or “no worries.” The video is peopled with what seem to be troubled young men and women, weighted by the worries of the world, and at the end an elderly couple, who though world-weary share a deep love for each other. I think I get the video, even if not all of the lyrics. It seems to be suggesting that to struggle through the trials of this world can bring you to a deeply shared love, but it does not discount the trials themselves. Usually when I tell myself “don’t worry,” I fear something or am worrying myself sick. I am almost wishing my worries away with a kind of crude magic: if I say it, it will be so.</p><br><p> No need for the crude or the magic, as we learn in many of the readings for&nbsp;this week. Both the first and the second readings for much of the Seventh Week of Easter have this “nothing to fear” quality and it is not because everything is wonderful, but because things are about to get bad, at least at the human level where we all live, work and eat.&nbsp; One of the themes that the readings this week are asking us, I think, is to grasp the reality of suffering. At a spiritual level this “nothing to fear” or “no worries” attitude can sometimes seem like a cop out, an inability to take seriously the pain or suffering that drives us to our knees or crushes hope. Christians can talk a lot about suffering in an ethereal way, as a means to avoid thinking about other people’s suffering or feeling their own. &nbsp;Yet, the readings for this week balance the human pain and losses with the comfort that Jesus, too, will experience this loss and has transcend it not by wishing it away but by accepting it. The Apostle Paul, too, gives us a model of one who for the faith accepts the pain that will come his way for the greater glory of God’s kingdom. Both Jesus and Paul in the readings this week focus our minds on the suffering that will come and.....

	</p><p> <em>We are happy to feature this guest blog post from Francis A. Quinn, the archbishop emeritus of Sacramento, Calif.:</em></p><br><p> One of the most memorable moments of my life was when I conferred the Sacrament of Confirmation on 20 youths in San Francisco's Children's Hospital. The children were from 4 to 16 years of age and were dying from leukemia. I was apprehensive about how these young ones would feel about receiving Confirmation.</p><br><p> When I arrived, I found many of the children bald from chemotherapy and radiation, thin and pale, their faces as white as the pillows on which they lay. I imagined they would be resentful, angry at a God letting them die so young. I thought they might be rejecting God.</p><br><p> The cynical parody of the beautiful hymn "Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow" came to mind:</p><br><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Praise God from whom all cyclones blow. <br>Praise God when rivers overflow. <br>Praise God when earthquakes strike the steeple, <br>Bring down the church and kill the peoples.</p><br><p> Might these children be having similar feelings?</p><br><p> As I anointed their foreheads with the Chrism oil, their faces were peaceful, serious and with a look of awe realizing that they were receiving a gift from God. What faith they had.</p><br><p> Today, we are told that religious Faith is declining in America. Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris have written bestselling books about atheism. Billboards appear in major cities proclaiming that God is at worse dead and at best unnecessary. We live in a culture that is more and more secular. We live in a world reliant on science--and that is good.</p><br><p> Science is not an opponent of religious faith. Both are a part of God's truth. Evolutionist Charles Darwin did not want his discoveries to diminish faith in God. Albert Einstein believed in a supreme intelligent being. Today, Stephen Hawking sees God in the laws of the universe. One of the most gifted scientists Louis Pasteur said, "Because I am a scientist, I have the faith of a French peasant; if I continue to study science, someday I may have the faith of a French peasant's wife."</p><br><p> There are many challenges to our religious faith. We puzzle about a merciful God and the suffering of innocent children, women and men in the earthquakes of Haiti and Chile. Yet even in their suffering, these victims seem to draw closer to God. "Through the tear in broken hearts, God is finally seen." God knows the full answ.....

	</p><p> The First Readings for the <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/050610.shtml">Thursday</a> and <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/050710.shtml">Friday </a>of the Fifth Week of Easter continue with Acts 15:7-31. The issue of whether all Christians, including Gentiles, should follow the Mosaic Law was raised in Acts 15: 1-6. Only “after there had been much &nbsp;debate (15:7),” did Peter state that “God, who knows the human heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us; and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us” (15:8-9). The experience of the Holy Spirit amongst Gentiles, witnessed by Peter and detailed in Acts 10-11, is one of the key grounds for welcoming the Gentiles into the Church as Gentiles. &nbsp;Peter, according to Acts, understands that what was essential for salvation for all is “the grace of the Lord Jesus” (15:11). &nbsp;Paul and Barnabas continued to detail how God has worked amongst the Gentiles through “signs and wonders,” common language for miraculous deeds and the working of the Holy Spirit in Luke’s writing (15:12). In response to this testimony, and I suppose to the “debate” referenced earlier, James, the leader of the Jerusalem Church, states his decree.</p><br><p> James cites scripture, an amalgam of Amos 9:11-12 and, perhaps, Jeremiah 12:15 and Isaiah 45:21, to support his decision. I think this is an essential part of James’ decision, that whatever “new” is taking place at the Jerusalem Council has support not only from the experience of the Gentiles, as witnessed by the Apostles, but some scriptural warrant and so continuity with the covenant people and their practices. &nbsp;James does not require the Gentile members of the Church to follow all of the Mosaic Law, but requires that they “abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood” (15:20; see also 15:29 and 21:25). These requirements have&nbsp;been seen recently by scholars such as <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Convert-Apostolate-Apostasy-Pharisee/dp/0300052278/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1273176899&amp;sr=1-2">Alan Segal </a>and <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Romans-Mark-D-Nanos/dp/080062937X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1273176935&amp;sr=1-1">Mark Nanos</a>, for example, as referring at least in part to the &amp;.....

<div class="body">
	<p style="margin: 8px 10px 22px 10px;">
	</p><p> Today’s first reading details a moment in the early days of the young church in a way both vivid and stylized. Those reading the daily lectionary will have an even sharper sense of the unfolding of events from Acts of the Apostles. The material is action-packed, easy to appreciate. Among its favorite topics are the relations between Jewish and Gentile Jesus--believers as well as those Jews (and Gentiles) who are not drawn into the Jesus movement. Today’s reading gives us an opportunity to offer some fresh scholarship on this issue to our contemporaries who likely have other default assumptions as they read.</p><br><p> A few points: First: Practices among Jews, including those who were following Jesus, were generally diverse in time and place; though this reading can sound as though one decision set things for everyone, that cannot have been the case. Diversity would have continued. Second: When we hear the issue of Jewish law discussed in biblical texts, we need to remember who is talking and who is being addressed. There will have been different issues for Gentiles than for Jews, as we can understand that “insiders” often do not need or want orientations given to “outsiders.” Each will need something distinctive, suitable.</p><br><p> Third, related: When Paul speaks, he is typically, is talking to Gentiles about what they must do, not to Jewish believers about their practices. Paul remains thoroughly Jewish and needs to be understood as such. His “conversion” re-orients him powerfully to Jesus, but he does not cease to be a Jew. Luke, as presumed author of Acts of the Apostles, is more difficult to characterize, but we do best to assume he is writing to and for mixed communities. Fourth: Our contemporaries who hear these readings may think of Christianity as having basically superseded Judaism, as indeed homilies still frequently imply. Or, if more fortunate, they may have been introduced to the decades after Jesus as a time of the “parting of the ways,” as Judaism goes its distinct way (especially after the war with Rome and the destruction of the temple) and Christianity takes its departure from Judaism. But scholars are pointing out more recently that “the ways” remained much more blended for perhaps another few hundred years. An antipathy and animosity we may feel inevitable was perhaps far less strong.&nbsp; Fifth: We see in today’s reading from Acts the concern of Church lead.....

	</p><p> I raised the issue of institutional change in the Church in <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="../../blog/entry.cfm?blog_id=1&amp;entry_id=2792">a recent post</a>. The major problem with respect to change is the tensions it raises at the level of Church teaching - is this an issue where change can be envisioned or is this a part of the sacred deposit of faith, a revealed truth, a doctrine of the Church in which no change can be considered? Even when it is not a doctrine of the Church, such as in the case of the teaching on <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2010/05/03/a-doctrine-in-limbo/">limbo</a>, any sort of proposed change in the theological teaching of the Church raises tensions. Does this indicate that the Church has been wrong on a certain theological question? Does that mean that every theological truth and doctrine is up in the air? Some people desire change with respect to much Church teaching and others say no change at any level is possible. Related to this is the fact that change occurs at a human level, not just at a theological level, which I feel deeply since my proclivities run to the traditional and the stable and so proposals for change concern me. Yet, change, a deepening of the understanding of revelation and its interpretation within the Church, has been with the Church from the beginning.</p><br><p> The <a style="color:#0d6cad" href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/050510.shtml">first reading </a>for the Wednesday of the Fifth Week of Easter deals with the Jerusalem Council and the question of whether Christians have to follow the Mosaic Law in order to gain salvation. The traditionalist position was clear and seems to have scripture and tradition on its side:</p><br><p> "Then certain individuals came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved." (15:1)</p><br><p> and</p><br><p> "Some believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and said, "It is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses."(15:5)</p><br><p> I suspect that one of the passages on the minds of the Christians who wanted to maintain the Mosaic Law was this passage from Genesis: "God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and.....
