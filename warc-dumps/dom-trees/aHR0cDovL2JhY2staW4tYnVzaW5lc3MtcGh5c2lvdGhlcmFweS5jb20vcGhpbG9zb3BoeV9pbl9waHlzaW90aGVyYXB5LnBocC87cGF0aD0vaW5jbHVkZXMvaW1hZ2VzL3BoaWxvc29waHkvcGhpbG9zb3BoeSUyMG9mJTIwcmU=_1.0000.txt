	    <p align="center" class="style4">- a Kafkaesque perspective on the role of the Australian Physiotherapy Association </p>

	    <p align="center" class="style4">by Martin Krause, August 2004 </p>

	        <p align="justify">In Franz Kafka's book 'The Trial',&nbsp;it outlined 
              how a banker, Herr K, was notified that he was to stand trial.&nbsp; 
              Throughout the book, the reader's frustration grows as Herr K refuses 
              to attempt to defend himself, because he sees the trial as absurd 
              as he doesn't know why he is being tried.&nbsp; Finally, he is condemned 
              and we cannot understand why he didn't try to relate to his accusers.&nbsp; 
              A misconception in language leading to a difference in ethics, morality, 
              principles and hence reality? Existentialist philosophy believe 
              that we can only be defined by our actions. Therefore, our responses 
              to successes and failures will define us, and our insights can change 
              the world.</p>
            <p align="justify">Truth is considered a construct whereby reality 
              cannot exist on it's own without reference to other information. 
              Constructivism describes the process of learning and acquiring knowledge 
              through experiential reasoning. The assumption underlying 'constructivism' 
              is that we are 'life long learners' (3 l's) and that each and every 
              clinical encounter allows a unique opportunity to learn, relearn 
              and refine our techniques as well as reorganise and restructure 
              our knowledge base. Furthermore, constructivist theory suggests 
              that learning occurs which is based on each individuals unique prior 
              experiences. Truth is considered relative to the individuals construct 
              and hence diverges from logical positivism of science where 'truth' 
              can exist alone without reference to the observers perceptions. 
              This is similar to scientific philosophy of 'relative truths' or 
              the 'relativity of knowledge' espoused by Feyerabend (1975), Kuhn 
              (1970), Popper (1963). All of us would agree that science isn't 
              just a collection of laws, or a catalogue of unrelated facts. Rather, 
              it is a creation of the human mind relating to making sense of the 
              world. Hence, in musculoskeletal physiotherapy we must endeavour 
              to match the science with our clinical reasoning which should make 
              sense to the individual or organisations with whom we are interacting.</p>
            <p>Candy (1991, p 263) states that <i>"the constructivist perspective 
              differs significantly from the view of knowledge as deriving from 
              a process of copying or replicating." </i>Hence, <i>"we 
              know reality only by acting on it.....The active interaction between 
              the individual and the environment is mediated by the cognitive 
              structures of the individual......and what we learn from the environment 
              is dependent upon our own structuring of those experiences."</i> 
              (Nystedt and Magnusson 1982, p34)</p>

<p align="left"><span class="style5">So what does such existentialism 
                mean to NSW Physiotherapy?</span>&nbsp; At a meeting (July 2004) 
                of the PBA and a representative of Workcover NSW I felt that physiotherapists 
                may not be different to Herr K.&nbsp; Workcover NSW spoke about&nbsp; 
                'evidence based' physiotherapy, which to them appears to mean 
                cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and a 'median' of 8 treatments 
                (for Physio and Chiro).&nbsp; Since "there are lies, damned lies 
                and statistics" (D'Israeli)&nbsp; does this median represent both 
                treated and untreated injured workers?&nbsp; Do these 8 treatments 
                really represent the biological time frames for wound healing 
                and rehabilitation? </p>
            </div>
            <p align="justify">Some clinical physiotherapists felt that 'evidence based' may mean real time ultrasound and that the extra time and expense needed for this type of intervention should be reimbursed.&nbsp; The Workcover NSW representative had no idea what this was.&nbsp; Additionally, they were adamant that the 3 physiotherapists consulted in the reform process represented 'their' ideal reality.&nbsp; Moreover, the previous 'gold standard' of multiple psychometric evaluations which we were asked to implement in the past 2 years no longer seemed necessary.&nbsp; CBT and workplace related activity program (WRAP) are all the rage now.&nbsp; So who is the 'Übermensch' (Fredrich Nietzsche)? </p>

	        <p align="justify">Apparently, 2 academics were amongst the 3 physiotherapists 
              consulted.&nbsp; Perhaps, academics should be prepared to spend 
              a year in a clinic, without any other form of income or professional 
              satisfaction, to experience a clinician's and patient's existential 
              reality?&nbsp; Isn't this only reasonable, since they expect clinicians 
              to return to post graduate studies to endure their reality.&nbsp; 
              <span class="style5">What the clinician requires from academics 
              is a mutual understanding and recognition that most clinicians are 
              doing the best they can do, under the economic time constraints 
              imposed by undervaluing compensatory bodies and private insurers. 
              </span></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/philosophy/PragmatismIdealism.jpg" width="377" height="82"></p>

	    <p align="justify">Presently, The Centre for Independent Studies uses a 'Trends in Disability Support' graph from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2002) to demonstrate that over half&nbsp; of the 5% of Australians that are on a disability dependency payment (p83) are claiming Musculoskeletal and Psychological disability.&nbsp; This highlights the need to evaluate cost-benefit ratios employing the language of politicians, bureaucrats, autocrats and their economic advisors.&nbsp; Therefore, people with health economic modeling capabilities are required, who can argue clinical relevance based on multi-factorial and projective variables of productivity and vitality. &nbsp;<span class="style5">Unfortunately, in a power structured adversarial society, unless the Australian Physiotherapy Association employs such people, like Herr K, the profession may be condemned by uneconomic time constraints resulting in inadequate treatment outcomes.</span>&nbsp; Could academics, clinicians and statisticians be hired for such a role? </p>

	        <p align="justify">It is little wonder that there is such a high burn-out 
              rate amongst clinicians.&nbsp; Generally, the running of a private 
              practice requires the administration of multiple tasks for which 
              the clinician has neither economics nor business training. <span class="style5">Young 
              graduates seem surprised at the meager income of a clinician when 
              they compare this to other professions with similar or generally 
              much lower matriculation scores required to enter university</span> 
              (physiotherapy TER's have been in the 95% plus range for over a 
              decade).&nbsp; It is of little surprise that they all wish to administer 
              exercise programs, with 'hands on physiotherapy' being regarded 
              by young physiotherapists as too wearing on their own bodies, and 
              representing too little remuneration in a city as expensive as Sydney.&nbsp; 
              Moreover, administering exercise is an easier premise than the rigorous 
              process of <a href="InstructionDesign.php" class="pglink">clinical 
              reasoning </a>which deals one-on-one with a person's problems.&nbsp; 
              Additionally, with academics fearing 'patient dependency', the view 
              that exercise is preferential to 'hands on' treatment is reinforced.&nbsp; 
              The reality is, that 'hands on' treatment can be viewed as 'exercise 
              enabling' as well as providing cognitive feedback with respect to 
              diagnosis and prognosis through assessment and re-assessment of 
              disability and impairment.&nbsp; Moreover, the 'hands on' clinician 
              has more time to evaluate <a href="Neuro-immune_reponses_cognitive_behavioral_therapy.php" class="pglink">allostatic 
              loading capacity </a> and the clients response to potential 'yellow 
              and blue flags', which can be amenable to a cognitive behavioural 
              therapy approach to specific goal oriented exercise as well as education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly, 
              the clinician can screen for 'red flags' which may require careful 
              monitoring and/or surgical intervention.&nbsp; <span class="style5">Unfortunately, 
              the 'hands on' physiotherapist ends up a victim of their own success 
              when they physically cannot work more than 60 hours per week trying 
              to meet the demands of the public.</span>&nbsp; With a whole generation 
              of young Sydney University physiotherapy graduates seeming to think 
              that 'any' exercise therapy and 'being nice to people' is the only 
              way to tackle multi-dimensional musculoskeletal dysfunction, it 
              is no wonder that NSW private practitioners are having severe problems 
              with recruiting. </p>
            <p align="justify">More sensationalism occured around Dr Chris Mahers 
              work in late 2007 :<a href="http://apa.advsol.com.au/mail/MPA%2026November/lancet.html" target="_blank"> 
              http://apa.advsol.com.au/mail/MPA%2026November/lancet.html</a> where 
              mainstream national media both in Australia and the UK reveled in 
              the apparent uselessness of physiotherapy in the treatment of acute 
              low back pain. Who is out of touch here? If truth is a construct 
              based on the relativity of knowledge, then could an experienced 
              clinician be closer to the truth then certain researchers with naïve 
              reductionist paradigms? Moreover, since the vast majority of physiotherapists 
              in NSW were trained at Cumberland College/Sydney University, does 
              this mean that the School of Physiotherapy will critical appraise 
              it's own core curriculum and teaching methodologies? Is it true 
              to say, that the last far reaching innovative idea in Musculoskeletal 
              Physiotherapy from Cumberland College was from Jenny McConnell and 
              her motor control - taping techniques in 1985? Hence, could this 
              mean that more innovative and daring musculoskeletal research will 
              be done by Sydney Uni's School of Physiotherapy to ascertain how 
              to improve the efficacy of clinical practice? In this manner could 
              it follow the Schools of Physiotherapy in Queensland University 
              and Curtin University whereby, over the past decade, where they 
              have fundamentally changed the way we approach musculoskeletal physiotherapy? 
            </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/philosophy/Research-Orientation.jpg" width="634" height="225"></p>
            <p align="left">Interestingly, Chris Maher's personal communication 
              stated that 'he was sick and tired of everyone saying that the School 
              of Physiotherapy at Sydney University only publishes negative research'. 
              Overall, both he and the APA were surprised at the vehemence of 
              the memberships reaction to the media reports. How can they be so 
              out of touch, not to realise that this is dealing with peoples existence 
              and maybe their underlying aggression towards the people who taught 
              them the profession is founded on the lack of prior warnings which 
              may have included statements such as "The fundamental principles 
              of Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy are baseless innuendo"? Perhaps, 
              similar to warnings about cancer on cigarette packets the School 
              of Physiotherapy at Sydney University should clearly define the 
              hopeless nature of musculoskeletal physiotherapy, in treating low 
              back pain, to all intending applicants to the course? Alternatively, 
              the aggression may be more likely to be the perception that the 
              onus is on the clinician to change the way they do things to demonstrate 
              efficacy in clinical practice? Perhaps the clinician needs to "ask 
              not what your researcher can do for you, but what you can do for 
              your researchers"? (pardon the paraphrasing). I certainly whole 
              heartedly agree that management of musculoskeletal conditions must 
              include the clinical reasoning approach which incorporates continuous 
              demonstrations of efficacy whilst using and enhancing 'evidence 
              based practice'. However, do we need our own insecurities published 
              to the world? Would they be better published to a physiotherapy 
              audience? Would the reaction be the same? Will this create positive 
              change or more pessimism, learned helplessness and burnout?</p>
            <p align="center"> "The path to hell is paved with good intentions"</p>
            <p align="left">Make no mistake about it, Dr Chris Maher's research 
              over the past decade will have far reaching consequences for physiotherapists 
              treating low back pain. It may well be, that insurers will refuse 
              to pay for such treatment. It is even possible that any physiotherapist 
              treating low back pain may be charged with over-servicing. Perhaps 
              it is time for clinicians and academics to come together and develop 
              more meaningful research paradigms where the process of validation 
              is addressed by defining the essential clinical questions?</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/philosophy/PracticeBasedEvidence.jpg" width="585" height="263"></p>

	        <p align="justify">Since the early 1990's we have witnessed serious 
              shortfalls in funding resources for health due to the demands of 
              increasing burdens from an aging population or from the spread of 
              serious disease (HIV and metabolic syndrom). The physiotherapy profession 
              as a whole have been extremely pre-emptive in their quest to validate 
              the efficacy of their health management systems. As the good times 
              of seemingly unjustifiable funding are over, the reactive elements 
              of the profession who didn't see it coming may end up being the 
              ones the scream loudest. The danger here it would seem is that parts 
              of the profession would like to see a Kuhnesque revolution of paradigm 
              shift, which may be more suitable to bodies outside of the profession.&nbsp; 
              Where major changes to health systems are imposed by policy committees, 
              which do not represent the interests of all stake holders (clinicians, 
              patients, insurers), then disenchantment and burn-out from all disempowered 
              clinicians is likely to follow.&nbsp; More alarmingly, this may 
              have severe and far reaching consequences on the quality of treatment, 
              early access to appropriate treatment and hence the future costs 
              of health for many Australians. </p>

              the examination of the Pain and Philosophy of the Mind (Alex Cahana

              'mind-body supervenience' (physicalism or materilism) where pain 
              always has a physical substrate, isn't enough to explain the qualitative

              is that 'you are nothing but your synapses' ("eliminative") 
              or 'you are ultimately your synapses' ("reductive" or

              conference in Adelaide in 1995.</p>
            <p align="justify">Cahana (2007) concludes by stating that "pain 
              cannot be seperated from the person experiencing it, and the human 
              experience cannot be omitted from a scientific explanation of how 
              our mind works. Therefore, a new subjectivist, interpretive, phenomenological 
              stance is needed in order to capture the complexity of the patient's 
              narrative experience (narrative dyad)".</p>

            </p><p align="left">Fear connotes an identifiable threat (eg King Brown 
              snake), whereas anxiety connotes the possibility of threat. Fear-avoidance 
              relates to the behaviour that an identified activity may have (real 
              or imaginary). Kinesiophobia refers to the patient experiencing 
              "an excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of physical 
              movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability 
              to painful injury or reinjury" (Kori SH et al Pain Management 
              1990; Jan/Feb:35-43) 
            </p><p align="left">Avoidance behaviours occur in anticipation of pain 
              and generally persist because there are few opportunities to correct 
              the eroneous expectations which drive them. This has a deliterious 
              effect in the engagement of ADL which then in turn can lead to mood 
              disturbances, irritability, frustration and depression. The fear-avoidance 
              behaviour leads to secondary consequences of deconditioning whereby 
              normal activity such as carrying the shopping leads to excessive 
              fatigue, heart palpitations, nausea and distress. 
            </p><p align="center"><img src="images/chroniclowbackpain/Fear.jpg" width="566" height="365"></p>
            <p align="left">Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) focuses on the 
              content of the disorder which has lead to the excessive behaviour. 
              Through progressive cognitive appraisal and re-appraisal the irratitionality 
              of the behaviour is reduced. Another method of dealing with mal-adaptive 
              behaviour is to recognise the behaviour for what it is and attempt 
              to associate this behaviour with positive thoughts, experiences 
              and activities. Hereby, neurons that fire together, wire together 
              into a positive movement experience. The original fear &amp; anxiety 
              may not be extinguished but the ability 'to move on' and the ability 
              to neither dwell on the anxiety nor on the content of that anxiety 
              is taught and learned. Importantly, education into how the brain 
              processes and deals with information, using PET scans, fMRI's, flow 
              diagrams, etc become very useful tools when explaining the usefulness 
              of graded motor imaging (GMI) tasks. Recently, however, Lorrimer 
              Moseley has suggested to firstly use computer generated images to 
              distinguish any signs of cortical laterality bias either towards 
              or away from the affected region. This appears to be particularly 
              useful for CRPS, frozen shoulder and neuropathic limb pain, but 
              may not be so relevant to spinal pain. Never-the-less, recognition 
              and education of the problem are paramount to successful outcome.

              of pain impulses, as well as change the behaviour towards those

	        <p align="justify">The 5th international congress in low back pain 
              concluded last week in Melbourne (Nov 2004).&nbsp; Apart from the 
              usual palabra, there seemed to be some common sense coming from 
              the floor into the discussions.&nbsp; The great proponents of reductionist 
              paradigms for studying so called 'non-specific low back pain' came 
              under fire for the 10 years of misdirected and misguided research 
              trying to identify specific variables using a non-specific paradigm.&nbsp; 
              Cognitive factors, including beliefs, depression, kinesiophobia 
              were thought to make up around 50% of measurable outcome variables, 
              disability 30% and impairment only 20%. Whilst the statistical methodology 
              &amp; reasoning was highly commendable, the premise of a lot of 
              research on the efficacy of treatment interventions was that all 
              physiotherapists are equal.&nbsp; It would seem ludicrous that the 
              same proponents of graduate programmes in Musculoskeletal and Sports 
              Physiotherapy can rationalise that the skill level of the physiotherapist 
              is irrelevant to outcome.&nbsp; These arguments seem to have arisen 
              from poorly designed investigations in the mid 90's.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	    <p align="justify"><span class="style5">Impairment measures are traditionally seen as 'range of movement' and sometimes neurological impairment.&nbsp;</span> However, more difficult measures which usually aren't included in impairment measures are quality of movement, and the muscle activation required for the distribution of force across joints and between body segments ( <a href="endurance_training.php" class="pglink">inverse dynamics </a> and Newtons 3rd Law).&nbsp; Additionally, when considering the 'mass-spring' analogy of movement and energy conservation, then perturbations of movement and the capture of energy from perturbations of movement, such as <a href="endurance_training.php" class="pglink">plyometrics </a>,&nbsp; become important aspects in the clinical reasoning paradigm. Yet, how are these measured in the NSLBP paradigm by traditional 'non-progressive' research. </p>

	        <p align="justify">Those same protagonists also argued in the 1990's that 
              there was no role for dose in manual therapy.&nbsp; (Dose representing 
              the force, duration, frequency, number of repetitions, the type 
              of technique used commiserate with the stage, stability, severity 
              and irritability of the disorder as well as based on the identification 
              of the 'cause of the cause' of the dysfunction).&nbsp; Additionally, 
              <span class="style5">back in the 1990's they used placebo constructs 
              which ignored the fundamental role of higher centres in pain and 
              information processing.</span>&nbsp; Even the paper which I submitted 
              to Manual Therapy for publication on mechanical traction had the 
              descending modulation and cortical modulation aspects deleted from 
              it by the co-authors. </p>

              treatment approaches are now receiving some credibility as a research

              intervention for pelvic girdle dysfunction is being extracted out 
              of the NSLBP paradigm.&nbsp; Progressive research on impairment 
              and specifically the importance of muscular forces are being performed 
              by Wim Dankearts under the guidance of Peter O'Sullivan.&nbsp; They 
              are working towards a novel classification system for non specific 
              chronic low back pain patients which includes higher order mental 
              processing. Specifically, Peter O'Sullivan has put forward 3 sub-categories 
            </p>

	    <ol><li><p align="justify"><em>"Pain disorders associated with movement impairments are associated with a loss of normal physiological movement of lumbo-pelvic mobility, and abnormally high levels of muscle guarding and co-contraction of lumbo-pelvic muscles with generation of intra-abdominal pressure....[resulting in].....excessive force closure" </em></p>

          </li><li>

            <p align="justify"><em>"Pain disorders associated with control impairment are associated with no impairment to the mobility of the symptomatic spinal segment, but rather present with impairments or deficits in control of the symptomatic spinal segment pressure...[resulting in]....reduced force closure" </em></p>

          </li><li>

            <p align="justify"><em>"......mal-adaptive movement and motor patterns result in chronic abnormal tissue loading and ongoing pain and distress......These disorders are also invariably associated with non-organic factors but these factors do not dominate the disorder, leaving them more amenable to physiotherapy intervention based on a cognitive behavioural motor learning model" </em></p>

          </li>

	        <p align="justify">Unfortunately, the non-specific paradigm has given 

              the ammunition needed for proponents to suggest that any exercise 

              regime is better than something based on a clinical reasoning process 

              administered by highly qualified physiotherapists using 'state of 

              the art' research coming out of Europe, Queensland and Western Australia.&nbsp; 

              <span class="style5">Ironically, in the medical profession, if you 

              specialise your remuneration increases, whereas in physiotherapy 

              the prevailing argument (in NSW) suggests that you are wasting everybody's 

              time and money because "85% of low back pain is non-specific".&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

              I'll let you decide the absurdity or otherwise of this paradigm.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            </p>

            <p align="justify">The APA actively promotes the new title of specialization, 
              yet this is meaningless if there is little promotion of the already 
              existing titled members. There is also little standardization of 
              fees charged by titled members as this would lead to charges of 
              collusion by the ACCC. It then becomes increasingly difficult for 
              individuals to charge the public more, if the public have no idea 
              what value they are getting for their money. Some brave clinicians 
              have commenced using item descriptors to charge their clients more 
              when being treated by a more highly qualified physiotherapist. Ironically, 
              I would suggest that close to 100% of the adult population knows 
              what a chiropractor does, but that hardly anyone knows what a Musculoskeletal 
              Physiotherapist does!!!! Even concepts evolved from research into 
              Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy, such as 'core stability' are perceived 
              by the public to be something which happens at the gym and hence 
              belongs to the Exercise &amp; Sports science profession!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p align="justify"> A decade ago, there was extreme competition to 

              gain entry into post graduate Manipulative Physiotherapy. Once in 

              the course, students worked 24/24 -7/7 and needed to complete research 

              just to get through a graduate diploma, whereas the Masters required 

              1.5-2 years. Generally, most post graduate courses have been diluted 

              and made easier where a double Masters degree without a research 

              component can be gained within a year. Such dilution was due to 

              funding as well as making the course more attractive to non-suffering 

              types. Moreover, the introduction of entry level Masters Programmes 

              of Physiotherapy may have further diluted the perceived value of 

              titled post graduate Musculoskeletal qualifications. Yet, In some 

              instances this easing of entry and completion requirements may be 

              a reflection on the reduced clinical and theoretical competencies 

              of both the people teaching the courses as well as those taking 

              the courses? In fact, experienced clinicians in this State have 

              been left wondering why graduates have such poor clinical skills. 

              They seem to have a lot of trouble even defining 'function' let 

              alone dysfunction. Their movements analysis skills are reduced to 

              goniometers and tape measures, where analysis in the quality of 

              movement seems impossible. This suggests to me that graduate entry 

              Masters Physiotherapy courses make a lot of sense if they are preceded 

              by a degree in Exercise and Sports Science, similar to that offered 

              at Griffith University. However, that leaves us then with the problem 

              of 'what next'? </p>

            <p align="justify">Since there is little promotion of post graduate 

              skills to the public, is it little wonder that very few Australians 

              attend these University courses. Even worse, some Universities spent 

              a decade denigrating the profession's treatment of low back pain 

              in their search for the holy grail of the 'ultimate psychometric 

              evaluation'. A recent article (Inmotion August 2006) by a highly 

              successful private practitioner in Sydney, <font color="#009900">Jospehine 

              Key</font>, highlighted the poor clinical capability of many of 

              the post graduate people she interviews. She laments the attitude 

              of the major local institution that "if you can't prove it 

              then you can't teach it", and furthermore she believes that 

              the public place more faith in the "new experts" who are 

              "the gym instructors and personal trainers, the fitness specialists, 

              the Pilates and Yoga teachers, and even exercise physiologists". 

              Furthermore, she makes a highly valid point by stating the undergraduate/postgraduate 

              physiotherapists receive far less supervised contact time than those 

              studying osteopathy or chiropractic. Hence, she concludes that the 

              discerning consumer will choose to go elsewhere if we cannot deliver. 

            </p>

            <p align="justify">The reality is that post graduate courses represent 

              an extremely expensive option of around $20,000 in student fees 

              as well as lost income from taking a year out of work. Hence these 

              courses are now attended by foreign students who return to their 

              country of origin and are idolized for their knowledge. They frequently 

              open successful practices and partake in delivering continuing education 

              - lecture tours where a few hundred thousand dollars a year remuneration 

              is not uncommon. The average income of Australian physiotherapists 

              is around $60-90,000per annum, generally regardless of post graduate 

              qualification. Interestingly, the profession seems to be coming 

              full circle, whereby physiotherapists in some countries (e.g. Chile 

              &amp; Switzerland) are undertaking Osteopathy courses rather than 

              Physiotherapy courses. This is similar to Australasian physiotherapists 

              in the late 1960's/ early 1970's attending osteopathy courses in 

              the UK to gain post graduate experience. Those therapists in turn 

              worked on creating the first post graduate physiotherapy courses 

              in Manipulative Physiotherapy. Is this the beginning of the end? 

              In recent years, the undergraduate physiotherapy course has become 

              a conduit for entry into medicine. Although, the number of physiotherapists 

              undertaking post-graduate medicine are small, their number would 

              be in the vicinity of those who used to undertake post graduate 

              physiotherapy courses.</p>

            <p align="justify">A current solution seems to be clinician - university 

              partnerships whereby private practitioners engage and pay for University 

              amenities whilst offering private post graduate qualifications.

              and Kim Robinson</a> are both Mulligan Instructors who have developed 

              a post graduate course of instruction with Curtin University. <font color="#FF0000">This 

              partially solves the problem of private consortiums such as those 

              in Europe generating decades of profits from education based on 

              Australian Research paid by the Australian tax payer. </font>On 

              a brighter note, a new Masters Programme in both Sports and Musculoskeletal

              when one considers that 20 years ago, the qualification of an Austrian 

              Physiotherapist was "an assistant in physical and rehabilitation 

              medicine" which involved 2 years of non-university study. Hence, 

              is Australia still leading the world in Physiotherapy or falling 

              behind it? What are the role of private-public partnerships in clinical 

              education and should some of their profits be funding University 

              based research? </p>

            <p align="justify">The dropping numbers of students aren't confined 

              to Physiotherapy courses and has been attributed to Australian federal 

              government policy. The Financial Review 28 August 2006 describe 

              a massive drop by 18% in the number of all new enrolments by Australian 

              students starting university, between 2002 and 2005.<font color="#FF0000"> 

              Craig Emmerson, the opposition spokesman stated on ABC's Lateline 

              (08/09/2006) that spending on training in real terms by the Australian 

              government has gone backwards by 8 per cent, whereas for the rest 

              of the OECD, it's gone forward by 38 per cent over the same period.</font><font color="#009900"> 

              Sadly, the Australian Musculoskeletal &amp; Sports Post Graduate 

              Physiotherapy education program is in danger of becoming extinct 

              due to lack of local enrolment as well as poorly federally funded 

              clinical education components of the courses</font><font color="#00FF00">.</font> 

              Previously, these courses relied on the altruism of physiotherapists 

              devoting their time and knowledge for the greater good. In fact, 

              this free website reflects the importance I place to the continuing 

              development of the profession. Interested readers should refer to 

              the article on the dire future of Post Graduate Physiotherapy education 

              by Gwen Jull and Peter O'Sullivan in the June 2006 edition of the 

              Australian Journal of Physiotherapy. The APA and profession at large 

              must act now by promoting the superior skills of physiotherapists 

              with post graduate qualifications, <b>otherwise the ultimate paradigm 

              shift will inevitably occur.</b></p>

              of the injury with adequate/inadequate/delayed intervention</b></p>

            <p align="left"><br>
              As musculoskeletal physiotherapists we can frequently resolve the 
              acute/sub-acute injury within 3-6 treatments using 'pattern recognition' 
              and relatively standardized treatment approaches. However, if we 
              use a clinical reasoning approach examining cause and effect there 
              may be multiple structures which may need treatment. For example, 
              with lumbar spine radiculopathy, initial treatment may involve sustained 
              rotation and/or mechanical traction as well as some simple transverse 
              abdominal exercises and breathing. However, examination of the mechanisms 
              leading up to the injury may suggest reduced muscular compliance 
              in the lower limbs, stiffness in the thoracic spine leading to reduced 
              lateral thoracic expansion required for adequate diaphragm activation. 
              The consequences of the injury may be muscle spasms in the multifidus, 
              erector spinae, piriformis, hamstrings, calfs and Psoas Major accompanied 
              by deactivation of the deep hip, pelvic, and abdominal stabilizers 
              leading to alterations in lumbo-pelvic rhythm from reduced proprioception 
              as well as corrupted motor control. At a standard physiotherapy 
              consultation of $75.- per treatment, the primary symptoms can be 
              quickly treated leading to a highly profitable practice when working 
              at 3 patients an hour. The physiotherapist can be heartened by the 
              fact that most of these conditions will resolve spontaneously and 
              hence they only need to worry about not exacerbating the condition. 
              However, as a Musculoskeletal Physiotherapist and Exercise &amp; 
              Sports Scientist for me to examine and respond to the multi-dimensional 
              and multi-factorial problem (cause &amp; effect) in a multi-modal 
              manner, I need at least 45 minutes per treatment session. Here, 
              I would need to assess neurological signs and symptoms, examine 
              multiple joint structures using various techniques, examine muscles 
              for the strength, power, endurance, flexibility, and timing of action, 
              as well as consider motor control. Additionally, I would need to 
              address psychosocial issues as well as general health issues resulting 
              from a general lack of exercise. Hereby, the validity of the diagnostic 
              procedure are enhanced whereby disability and impairment measures 
              are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment. A Clinical 
              Psychologist can charge $180- per treatment and an Exercise Physiologist 
              charges $150.-. Suddenly, the highly qualified and undervalued Musculoskeletal 
              Physiotherapy clinical reasoning approach, using 'state-of-art' 
              reasoning and treatment becomes very uneconomical at $75.- per 45 
              minute treatment session ($100.- per hour). Even the basically qualified 
              masseur charges at least this if not more. Therefore, what is the 
              incentive for Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists? Apart from the incentive 
              of ethics and morality, the harshness of reality is that we need 
              to feed our family after taking off 2/3 of our income to pay for 
              the over-heads of running a business. Moreover, in a society where 
              'might is right' it values those principles which make people wealthy 
              as this is regarded as synonymous with success</p>

            <p align="left">Recently, I had a client who sprained their ankle 
              on some stairs at work.&nbsp; They worked in a high pressured environment 
              and had young children.&nbsp; Their stress relief was to go running.&nbsp; 
              Additionally, they had commenced running some years ago because 
              it helped alleviate their low back pain from sitting at a desk all 
              day.&nbsp; Due to the ankle sprain, they had to stop running.&nbsp; 
              This resulted in less coping with stress and a gradual increase 
              in their previous low back.&nbsp; This created some anxiety as the 
              back pain had been severe in the past.&nbsp; There was also some 
              irritability with work colleagues, wife and children because they 
              weren't getting out for their usual runs with their friends.&nbsp; 
              This made them a little depressed, especially since the ankle injury 
              was slow to resolve, and their low back pain was preventing them 
              from lifting their 6 month old baby and playing with their 2 year 
              old.&nbsp; Obviously, psycho-social factors are becoming dominant.&nbsp; 
              So, what is the solution?&nbsp; CBT? Goal setting and reassurance?&nbsp; 
              Yoga and transcendental meditation?&nbsp; Fixing the sprained ankle?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Clearly, ankle impairment and hence disability is the causative 
              factor which has the potential to resolve all the other factors.&nbsp; 
              Yet, in non-specific low back pain is causation a measurable factor?&nbsp; 
              If the client is still at work, then Workcover has achieved it's 
              outcome goal.&nbsp; Since part of evidence based practice should 
              incorporate the "values and beliefs of the client" then is this 
              satisfactory for the client who is unable to participate in the 
              day-to-day care of their family or in their social interaction in 
              sport?&nbsp; </p>

	    <p align="justify">At the MPA conference in Sydney in 2003, Professor Richard Deyo described a professional baseball player who returned rapidly to National League baseball after an injury.&nbsp; By referring to the newspaper sports results, he most poignantly demonstrated that although he had made a quick return to work (RTW), his run and strike rate had dropped dramatically.&nbsp; No doubt the Workcover equivalent in the USA was overjoyed at the quick RTW for a professional baseball player.&nbsp; However, what did the club president, coach, shareholders, and advertisers think of the loss of form of their star player?&nbsp; Importantly, how is productivity measured? In a Psycho-social domain?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	    <p align="justify">Psychometric measurements were examined in the past decade to determine what constitutes optimal treatment.&nbsp; However, <span class="style5">the argument is circular, since neither optimal treatments nor optimal psychometric measures have been defined.&nbsp;</span> Unfortunately, lack of either has been used to emphasise the inefficacy of physiotherapy for the treatment of non specific low back pain.&nbsp; Clearly, these measures need to be context specific.&nbsp; Importantly, disability and impairment can create issues in the psycho-social domain, which in turn can create further disability and impairment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p align="left">To the constructivist, knowledge is not a precise 
              map of external reality but a schemata or cognitive structure which 
              can be compared or tested to other peoples construction of the same 
              situation through the use of workable hypothesis or templates (Candy 
              1991, p 265). Domain specific prior knowledge plays a significant 
              role in the process of construction, problem solving and learning. 
              Systematic procedures for problem solving can be learnt which if 
              content and context specific can lead to advanced clinical reasoning 
              where errors in heuristic procedures can be detected immediately 
              through the continuous testing of the working hypothesis and it's 
              evaluation of the relevance of clinical data to the specific problem 
              at hand. Hereby, not only can reliance on 'heuristics' be monitored 
              but new schemata can be construed from the clinical environment 
              when a clinical presentation occurs with which the clinician is 
              unfamiliar.</p>

	    <p align="justify">It is just as important for scientists to be clinicians, as clinicians to be scientists.&nbsp; As the science evolves, the questions which arise shouldn't be used to denigrate but rather ameliorate clinician insecurities.&nbsp; Since the work is still in progress, the knowledge generated should empower the clinician to better themselves.&nbsp; Similarly, the specialist clinician should empower the research scientist to be able to 'ask the relevant questions'.&nbsp; Otherwise, research paradigms using sub-optimal treatment to determine optimal outcomes will continue to generate confusion.&nbsp; This confusion could potentially be manipulated to reduce clinician credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	    <p align="justify">The June 2005 <em>inmotion </em> publication of the APA noted some interesting developments in the U.K.&nbsp; Physiotherapists are being trained in Accident &amp; Emergency triage procedures in addition to others being trained to perform arthroscopies by the end of the year!&nbsp; This up-training is apparently due to the imminent shortage of qualified medical practitioners as a result of the ever increasing age of the baby-boomer demographic.&nbsp; In Victoria, Australia, physiotherapists are covering musculoskeletal assessments in the Accident &amp; Emergency department of the Royal Melbourne Hospital.&nbsp; These developments are particularly interesting in that they represent a new and exciting career path for physiotherapists.&nbsp; Lack of career path and poor recognition of skills by the public and other health professions has been suggested as a disincentive for people to remain in the profession or even to take up physiotherapy as a career in the first place.&nbsp; In the USA for example, it appears to be becoming ever more difficult to entice graduates into a Physical Therapy programme due to the considerable costs of education and poor prospects for remuneration once they have graduated.&nbsp; Similarly, in Australia, where the matriculation entry level (TER) is in the the top few % of the state, new graduates are frequently bewildered to find that their student colleagues who had much lower TER's were earning a lot more than them.&nbsp; Furthermore, the ceiling in earning capacity is reached very quickly leading to physiotherapists working longer hours, with no 'downtime' causing either physical injury and/or burnout in over 1/3 of graduates.&nbsp; The recent developments in the UK may represent a potential remedy for the chronic shortage of skilled physiotherapists by representing an exciting new career path with considerable potential for personal and professional development? </p>

                    <p class="style1">The APA has recently lodged a submission to the Productivity Commission Review of the health workforce. </p>

                    <p class="style1">The APA recommendations focus on the removal of barriers for patients to access physiotherapy services and on allowing physiotherapists to work more productively and better utilise their skills for the benefit of the Australian community. </p>

                    <p class="style1">The APA proposals would ultimately benefit the health workforce. By using physiotherapists' skills more effectively our workforce would be used more efficiently and retention of experienced clinicians would be improved with greater opportunity to use their knowledge and experience more constructively. </p>

                    <p class="style1">APA recommendations to the Productivity Commission include: </p>

                    <ul>

                      <li class="style1">Formalisation of extended scope practice roles for physiotherapists who undergo additional training.

                      </li><li class="style1">Approval of physiotherapists as first contact practitioners by all third party payers.

                      </li><li class="style1">Patients referred by physiotherapists direct to specialists (without a GP referral) to be able to claim a Medicare rebate.

                      </li><li class="style1">Patients referred by medical specialists direct to physiotherapists to be eligible for a Medicare rebate.

                      </li><li class="style1">Introduction of new MBS items for the management of specific conditions where evidence supports the effectiveness of that intervention.

                      </li><li class="style1">Formalisation of the role of physiotherapy assistants.

                      </li><li class="style1">Transformation of Division of General Practice into Divisions of Primary Care to promote a multidisciplinary approach to healthcare, particularly for patients requiring chronic disease management. </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p class="style1">Among other issues, the APA submission also highlighted the current crisis in the funding for physiotherapy education and the impact that it is having on clinical education. This will of course also impact strongly on our workforce unless there is quick resolution to this crisis. </p>

                    <p class="style1">The APA recommendations were developed following a very informative meeting with Mr. Rob Fitzgerald, one of the Productivity Commissioners responsible for this review, and some of his staff. The APA recommendations are well considered; if implemented they will go a long way to addressing many of our key concerns and help physiotherapists to better contribute to 21st century clinical practice. </p>

                    <p class="style1">Once our submission and the accompanying media release were made public, there was strong response from the medical practitioner peak bodies. This debate is likely to intensify over the next few weeks as the AMA and other organisations attempt to contest our logic that the MBS should be opened up so that patients can receive a rebate for such services as physiotherapy management of an acute sprained ankle. Such opposition does not often reflect the views of the GPs or specialists with whom physiotherapists work on a daily basis, many of whom are very supportive of our initiatives. </p>

                    <p class="style1">Your support for these recommendations is 

                      most important. I would urge you to read our submission 

                      and the media releases which accompany it so that you can 

                      enter into an informed discussion with key stakeholders 

                      including your referring medical practitioners, your patients 

                      and local members of parliament. - <a href="http://www.google.com/u/AusPhysioAssoc?domains=apa.advsol.com.au&amp;sitesearch=apa.advsol.com.au&amp;hq=-inurl%3Ascriptcontent&amp;q=extended%2Bscope%2Bpractice" target="_blank" class="pglink">see
