President Johnson, and he was invited to assume the important office of Director of
the Bureau of Statistics</span>.  At that time the war had closed, and the administration, in
obedience to the demands of the country, had set about an attempt to reform the wretched
condition of the finances.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The revenues indeed, were more than sufficient for the
purposes of the Government</span>; but under the law as it then stood, they were levied without
equality, justice, economy, or indeed, system of any kind.  In a word, <span style="font-weight: bold">the revenues were
literally plundered from the people, and plundered indiscriminately</span>.  The debt
consisted of a great variety of obligations, the currency exhibited even greater
heterogeneity and disorder, and <span style="font-weight: bold">the expenditures, as authorised and ordered by
Congress, were colossal, extravagant and corrupt</span>."  [3-4].</span></p>

the Precious Metals</i></span>.  As the scope of this work and the manner of its composition are
both somewhat remarkable, it will doubtless prove of general interest to describe them. 
This work was planned so long ago as the year 1854, the author of that date having been
the financial editor of one of the New York morning papers.  The interval from that year
until 1876, when he examined the mines of Nevada and California, was occupied in the
studies, travels and collection of books and materials which were deemed necessary for
the purpose in view.  A number of essays on financial topics, by Mr. Del Mar, which
appeared variously in Hunt's Merchants' Magazine, the Social Science Review and the
National Intelligencer, attest the industry of the author during this period.  Other essays
from his pen on similar topics appeared in the editorial columns of the New York Herald,
New Nation, and other journals.  During all this time <span style="font-weight: bold">his collection of books was
constantly increasing, and by the year 1874 they amounted to a library of nearly ten
thousand volumes</span>, the collection being particularly rich in the commercial and
economical works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; such as Yarranton, Petty,
Lowndes, Harris, Sully, Locke, Tucker, Young, Newton, Maddox, Sinclair, De Luzac,
Turgot, Necker, D'Avenant, etc.  The historical, politico-economical and statistical sections
are also very complete.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span style="font-weight: bold">Alexander Del Mar's prescient and profound contributions to monetary economics
have been basically disregarded for the duration of a century.</span>  This paper sets out <span style="font-weight: bold">Del
Mar</span>'s contributions to monetary economics and economic statistics and demonstrates the
striking relevance of his contributions to modern monetary thought.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The contemporary
arbiters and judges of intellectual merit were aware of Del Mar's writings but Del Mar
was excluded from contemporary reference and recognition.</span>  His exclusion had led to
his having been denied his rightful place in the history of economic thought.  One
explanation for the silencing of <span style="font-weight: bold">Del Mar</span> is that his intellectual position placed him in
opposition to the views of the leaders of the profession.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Del Mar</span> was also forthright in his
criticisms of his contemporaries' views and was open in his writings in commenting on prior
anti-Semitism.  <span style="font-weight: bold">We present evidence suggesting that prejudice and bigotry in high
places in academia were involved in Del Mar's exclusion</span> from the consolidating
profession of academic economists in the late 19th century.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif">'The...alterations of 108 [years], including 78 years in the calendar, which were effected by
<span style="font-weight: bold">Augustus Caesar</span>, a subject yet to be treated herein, has thrown many ancient dates out
of joint.  Could they be re-established, it would probably be found that the adoption of the
12 months' year in Greece took place somewhat earlier than B.C. 508; most likely between
that year and the date of the calendar reform of <span style="font-weight: bold">Solon</span> [c. 630 - c. 560 B.C.E.]; in other
words, about B.C. 550.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However, it will be observed that <span style="font-weight: bold">in addition to several explicit accounts of the
change from a ten to a twelve months' year, we have several accounts of changes in
the zodiac</span>.  One says that "Musaeus" invented the sign of the Archer; another, that two
zodions were made out of one, namely, the Balance and Scorpion out of the Scorpion);
while still another asserts that Cleostratus first gave to the zodiac the Lamb and the
Archer.  The Rev. Dr. <span style="font-weight: bold">Greswell</span> [Edward Greswell 1797 - 1869], without even suspecting
that the zodiac previously had but ten signs, believes that the most recent zodions are the
Waterman and the Fishes;<sup>9</sup> but his evidence on this point has to be weighed against that
of <span style="font-weight: bold">Pliny</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If these conclusions concerning a ten months' year fail to agree with the appearance
of a 12 months' year in the Hebrew Scriptures or with the opinions of those expositors who
claim for the Hebrew Scriptures a greater antiquity than the time of <span style="font-weight: bold">Solon</span>, it is because
such a claim lacks the support of evidence.  There is nothing whatever but conjecture in
favour of the greater antiquity of the existing version of the Old Testament.  There is no
extant manuscript of the Bible older than the Christian aera, nor indeed is there one so old;
whilst the Bible itself does not pretend to be older than the period when Hilkiah the priest
found the Book of the Law and carried it to Shaphan, the scribe.  This was about B.C.

      <p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif">119 years; total 781 
        years. This information Varro said he got from the Annals of Etruria, 
        written in the eighth cycle; octavum tum demum agi (Censorinus xviii); 
        that is to say, the eighth cycle was then begun. If A.U. 704 [50 B.C.] 
        means 50 years before our aera<sup>2</sup> and Varro wrote directly after 
        the beginning of the eighth cycle, it follows from the foregoing data 
        that the Etruscan aera, from which the Cyclical Games took their periods, 
        began before B.C. 831. On the other hand, if, as we shall presently furnish 
        reasons to believe, the Varronian date, A.U. 704, means 35 years before 
        our aera (a difference from the previous hypothesis of 15 years) then 
        the Etruscan aera began on or before B.C. 816; thus, 35 plus 781=816. 
        According to <span style="font-weight: bold">Dodwell</span>, the Etruscan 
        aera began with <span style="font-weight: bold">Procas</span>, king of 
        Alba, B.C. 816, the very same year to which the present calculation conducts

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif">'To win the Romans from the degrading worship to which they had been forced by the
impious decrees of the Caesars, the christian authorities were constrained to employ such
devices as were suited to the opinions and prejudices of the times.  Among these was that
well established law of astrology, that incarnations would or must occur only at the period
of a conjunction of the Sun and Moon.  Hence <span style="text-decoration: underline">the Latin papacy proclaimed that Jesus was
born at Midnight, on the winter solstice and was conceived on the preceding vernal
equinox, when "the Sun and Moon conjoined over Jerusalem</span>."  <span style="font-weight: bold">To connect the
incarnation of Jesus with that of Romulus was an obviously indispensable condition
to the firm establishment of the christian religion in Rome</span>.  This was done by fixing the
year of Romulus in Olym. VI, 3, in which, according to <span style="font-weight: bold">Antimachus</span>, such a conjunction
had actually occurred.  Olym. VI, 3 was the year B.C. 753, according to the present
chronology.  Consequently this year was indicated by the <span style="font-weight: bold">christian chronologers</span> as that
of Romulus; and thus <span style="font-weight: bold">the aera</span> [beginning with the apotheosis ["deification", etc.] of

chronologists, the aera was reckoned from the foundation of cities.  But under the
hierarchies the aera was invariably reckoned from an Incarnation.  In fact the practice
continues to the present day, both in India, Thibet, China and Abyssinia.  The fulsome and
impious acclamations of <span style="font-weight: bold">Manilius,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Virgil, Ovid, Horace</span> and other poets of the Augustan

the index)] that still survive are worked backward from the Olympiads; so that when these
were shifted, Troja Capta was shifted with them.  For example, several of the Greek
chronologers counted from the first Olympiad backward to the return of the Heraclidae 328
years; and to the <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Capture of Troy</span></span> 80 years more.  Many of the other dates of Troja Capta
come from <span style="font-weight: bold">suspicious sources, as that imputed to Eratosthenes by Clement

was <span style="font-weight: bold">composed or else altered (probably altered) during the medieval ages</span>.  Other
aeras of Troja Capta, as that of the Parian marble, are anonymous; they lack authority; or,
as in this case, they have been <span style="font-weight: bold">tampered with and altered</span>.<sup>26</sup>  It is a <span style="font-weight: bold">suspicious
circumstance</span> that the canons of <span style="font-weight: bold">Eratosthenes</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Callimachus</span> vary by 56 years until
they reach the date B.C. 776, when they at once harmonize.  <span style="font-weight: bold">It is</span> also <span style="font-weight: bold">suspicious that

        884 were altered during the Augustan period to four-year periods of tetrateris, 
        whose epoch was fixed in B.C. 776, thus making a difference in many deduced

        <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span>, has evidently been altered twice; 
        that <span style="text-decoration: underline">the antiquity of Rome was 
        reduced by <span style="font-weight: bold">Augustus</span> from B.C. 816

        Sacred College</span> to B.C. 753</span>, which has long been and is still 
        its familiar aera. When these changes were made, the various manuscripts 
        within reach of the college, whether Augustan or medieval, in which deductions 
        from, or comparisons with the Greek Olympiads or other foreign aeras occurred, 
        were altered to tally with such changes of the aera. But in such a vast 
        undertaking some of the equivalent dates were overlooked; <span style="text-decoration: underline">manuscripts 
        then lost to view have since been recovered; and above all, immense collections 
        of ancient coins and marbles have been brought into view in recent years; 
        all of which evidences unite to restore the ancient dates and prove the 
        age and extent of the alterations</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold">In 
        the present work, except where explicit notice is given to the reader, 
        these alterations of the Sacred College have not been touched. No attempt 
        has been made to reconstruct the accepted chronology</span>. Nevertheless, 
        it is but proper to advise the reader that the alterations of the Roman 
        aera above alluded to were not made without introducing a host of conflicting 
        dates into history, which hitherto the modern critic has sought in vain 
        to reconcile with probability. A large proportion of these dislocations 
        arise out of the 15 years of alteration which was made or completed by 
        the Sacred College, probably during the pontificate of <span style="font-weight: bold">Gregory 
        VII</span>, A.D. 1073-85. Many dislocations which arose from the Augustan

<span style="font-weight: bold">Martin Luther</span> [1483 - 1546], a Saxon monk of the Augustine order, nailed to the door of
the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg on the Elbe, his "<span style="font-weight: bold">Ninety-five Theses</span>" denouncing the
sale of indulgences by the See of Rome.  <span style="font-weight: bold">This action is commonly taken to mark the
beginning of the Protestant Reformation.  But, in fact, the protest and movement
against Papal simony</span> ["the making of profit out of sacred things."; etc.] <span style="font-weight: bold">began long
before</span> [see 941].  <span style="text-decoration: underline">It is much more convincingly condemned in the pages of <span style="font-weight: bold">Matthew Paris</span>
[1200 - 1259] than in those of <span style="font-weight: bold">Martin Luther</span></span>.  However, in Matthew's time (13th century)
the movement received no popular support.  The people were so poor and miserable that
they could only suffer.  In the early part of the 15th century, when <span style="font-weight: bold">John Huss</span> [1369 - 1415
("burned as a heretic")] dared to brave the resentment of Rome, by denouncing its
encouragement of religious imposture and its simoniacal practices, the populace, though
in sympathy with its champion, shrank from his support and saw him burned at the stake
without an attempt at rescue.  But <span style="font-weight: bold">in</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Luther's time the case was different</span>.  <span style="font-weight: bold">A new world
had been discovered, the cosmogony of the Church had proved to be false and its
authority was much shaken</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">America</span> had yielded during the first 25 years of its
despoilment more gold and silver than Europe had possessed in coin and plate previous to
the Discovery</span>.  This metal had been hastily coined and thrown into the circulation, first of
Spain and afterwards of France, England and Germany.  The resulting Rise of Prices
threw all Europe into a ferment; a condition of affairs which <span style="font-weight: bold">afforded very substantial
support to Luther's stand against the Church</span>.  ("Halcyon Age," p. 14).'  [223-224].</span></p>

exactly 6585⋅78 days.  This is the most significant of all the cycles, and was well known to
the Hindus at a very early [how early?] date, "says <span style="font-weight: bold">Brennand</span> [W. Brennand]."  The
Chinese called this number of days a Ven, Fen, or Phen, (which means ten), the
Chaldeans, "The Period," and the Greeks, as many authors assert, a "saros," the root of
the word being sar, meaning ten.  However, the terms sossos, neuros and saros have
been explained by <span style="font-weight: bold">Polyhistor, Syncellus, Abydenus, Suidas, Vallancy, Dupuis,
Greswell</span> and other commentators, so variously, that in order to avoid a verbal dispute,
they have not been used in the present work at all.  The Ecliptical cycle embraces the
entire series of eclipses, of which there are usually 29 lunar and 41 solar.  The priests
employed it to awe the multitude and the commanders of armies to terrify the enemy[.]  
Moreover, there was built upon it an astrology and a messianic theory which pervades all
the religions of antiquity and which therefore renders a knowledge of this cycle and of its
origin and the uses to which it was put, of essential importance to the study of religion and
history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Bailly</span> fixes the discovery of this cycle in India and Tartary to the period when the
vernal equinox was well within the constellation Taurus, in other words, over four thousand
years ago.  This date for the vernal equinox in Taurus is <span style="font-weight: bold">based upon the erroneous
assumption that the number of the zodions</span> [apparently, "zodions" = signs of the Zodiac]
<span style="font-weight: bold">has always been twelve</span>.  It must therefore share the fate of the erroneous assumption. 
Other writers have discerned evidences of this cycle in India so early as the Mahabharata
wars, although it may not have been determined accurately until a later period.  <span style="font-weight: bold">IT WAS
ONLY AFTER THE 12TH CENTURY B.C. THAT WHAT APPEARS TO BE DISTINCT
MARKS MAY BE SEEN OF THE MESSIANIC THEORY TO WHICH THE CYCLE GAVE
RISE, OR WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED</span>.  <span style="font-weight: bold">This theory was that the Creator
would appear upon earth to rectify the deranged affairs of mankind every 6585
months</span>, or in as many months as there were whole days in the cycle.  As the year then
consisted of ten months, the incarnations or avatars fell every 658th year.  Continuing
upon the same line of thought, the messianic theory foretold the destruction of the world in
the same number of years 6585, from the Creation.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Grotesque as this theory may seem
to us when set forth in sober terms, it actually forms the basis and it may be added
the only basis, for some of the holiest and most tender beliefs in which humanity
has found consolation for the wounds and havoc of injustice, misfortune and death</span>. 
The philosopher may allude to it with coldness and contempt:  the worshipper can only
remember the maternal sanctuary at which he learnt those exquisite allegories behind
which lurks this skeleton of an astronomical truth.  As the cycle is really not a diurnal, but a
lunar one, it is treated more at length under 223 lunations and 6585 lunations q.v. [I have
not found an entry for "6585 lunations"]'  [247-248].</span></p>

five intercalaries.  On this subject we have the testimony of <span style="font-weight: bold">Ovid, Livy, Censorinus,
Aulus Gellius</span> and other ancient writers.  This testimony is corroborated by proofs from
extraneous sources.  There cannot be any reasonable doubt that previous to the period
ascribed to the second <span style="font-weight: bold">Buddha, Bacchus, or Hermes</span>, that is to say, <span style="font-weight: bold">between the eighth
and sixth centuries B.C., the year, among all civilised peoples, was divided into ten
months each of 36 days</span> and that in Rome, the day of rest, of worship and of fairs, was
the ninth and not the seventh, as it became at a later period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is a curious circumstance, which has not yet been satisfactorily explained, that in
the mythos of the Brahminical or Brahmo-Buddhic avatars the incarnated god is often
described as a <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ten months' child</span></span> [see 1088-1089], and that in such respect, as well as in
others, it differed wondrously from other children.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Ten months of 30 days each would
not differ so much from the ordinary period of gestation as to render it at all
wonderful; whilst ten months of 36 days would</span>.  It is therefore suggested that the true

year of 552 years.  This Buddhic interval was a solar divine year; whilst its progeny was

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">The chief sources of error in chronology and of confusion in ancient history
are, FIRST, the employment of lunar calendars; SECOND, the alterations in the year
of Rome and the Olympiads which were made by Augustus as afterwards modified
by the Latin Sacred College:  and THIRD, the employment of "A.D." and "B.C." dates</span>. 
The confusion produced by lunar, or luni-solar, calendars has been of so varied a
character that it is difficult to convey an adequate appreciation of it to persons not
especially skilled in chronology.  Suffice it to say that such calendars have been used as
artifices to shuffle out of view the most significant customs and important events:  <span style="font-weight: bold">with the
object to substitute in their places the MYTHS AND FABLES OF SUPERSTITION</span>.  The
ancient priests made such liberal use of these artifices that it may be asserted with little
fear of contradiction that history only begins with the establishment of solar calendars; and
that previous to the first charter of human progress, for such it is, there is nothing recorded
which possesses any historical value.  The confusion occasioned by alterations of the
calendar will be illustrated by some examples further on.  The inconvenience of "A.D." and
"B.C." dates was realised three centuries ago by <span style="font-weight: bold">Scaliger</span> [Joseph Justus Scaliger 1540 -
1609], who sought to remedy it by offering to the world the so-called <span style="font-weight: bold">Julian</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Aera</span>. 
Although but little use has hitherto been made of his suggestion, it can easily be shown
that this is a reform which, shirk it as we may, must nevertheless precede any attempt to
establish upon a sure foundation such literary fragments and archaeological monuments of
the past as time and proscription have spared to the modern world....'  [281].</span></p>

the Foundation of Rome and the Burning by the Gauls was precisely the same as that
between the Burning by the Gauls and the conflagration in the reign of <span style="font-weight: bold">Nero</span>.  According to
our present chronology the Foundation was in B.C. 753 and the burning by the Gauls in
B.C. 384.  This is an interval of 369 years.  From the burning by the Gauls to the
conflagration in the reign of Nero, July, A.D. 64, is 447 full years and a fraction.  Deduct
369 from 447 and the quotient is 78 years, which is the measure of the excess of the later
period over the earlier one.  Tacitus says that in fact the two periods were exactly equal: 
our chronology makes one of them longer than the other by 78 years.  It is impossible that
78 years of chronology and history could have been fabricated and stuffed into the most
recent and best known annals of Rome.  The calendar of the later Republican and early
Imperial periods of Rome may have been altered to the extent of ten or 15 years without
attracting attention; but not to the extent of 78 years.  The alteration, whenever it was
made, must therefore have been attached to a period long past, that is to say, to the earlier
period, before B.C. 384.  The nature of the alteration was therefore to sink 78 years from
the calendar.  Who made this alteration; when was it made; what was its object? 
Remember that <span style="font-weight: bold">Tacitus was a priest and a member of the Sacred College of Rome</span>,
and therefore one whose statement on this subject possesses the full force of official
authority.  The subject has thus far been blinked by historians and churchmen, but it
should be blinked no longer.  Where are those 78 years of Roman experience and of
Roman history?  Is mankind to be perpetually robbed of that valuable, that inestimable
portion of its inheritance which is to be found in the history of the greatest state of
antiquity?"  [282].</span></p>

years older than the Christian regnal years of the sovereigns whose effigies and names
are associated with them.  But in fact they are all, without exception, just 43 years older;
proving that 15 years have since been sunk from the Christian aera, A.D., by adding that
number of years to the Augustan aera, B.C.  For example, the coins of Geta are dated
"255."  According to the received chronology this sovereign began to reign and died A.D.
211-12.  The difference between 212 and 255 is 43 years, making it appear that his coins

the cause of its decline in the working of some one or other defective institute of that great
state, <span style="font-weight: bold">SOME</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">INSTITUTE THAT WAS ESPECIALLY INIMICAL TO THE WRITER</span>, as the
establishment of colonies, the unequal distribution of opportunity, wealth, lands, or political
power, or the growth of slavery, or the evils of the monetary system.  But <span style="font-weight: bold">a broader
survey of the subject rather leads to the conclusion that no single cause is sufficient
to account for the devolution of events which followed the Punic wars</span> [First:  264 -
241 B.C.E.; Second:  218 - 201; Third:  149 - 146].  The downfall of the republic and the
erection of the empire appear to have been due in part to all of these circumstances and
perhaps also to others, among <span style="font-weight: bold">not the least of which were religion</span> and the various
branches of knowledge and belief upon which religion was founded.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">After striving in vain
to uphold the tottering republic, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cicero</span> lived long enough to perceive that the catastrophe
was inevitable and that neither could he retard it, nor <span style="font-weight: bold">Caesar</span> accelerate it</span>.<sup>1</sup> [see footnote,

less equal in rank by a substantial equality of fortune, attainments and political power.  <span style="font-weight: bold">It

doubt with regard to his design.  The conquest of India by <span style="font-weight: bold">Alexander</span> [King of Macedonia
336 - 323 B.C.E. (356 - 323)] had brought anew to the western world the entire flood of
Brahminical myths.<sup>5</sup>  The eleventh, a supplementary incarnation of Vishnu (zodion of
Pisces) was at hand, and Caesar, (who, among his many gifts, was an accomplished
master of astrology,) had evidently determined to become its hero, for he publicly and
ostentatiously proclaimed his descent from the goddess Maria or Venus, and attested his
official acts with a seal which bore her effigy.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Marcus Coelius, writing to Cicero</span> in A.U.

        first and most important article in the constitution of this empire was 
        the extraordinary one of the Emperor's deification. Both <span style="font-weight: bold">in

        by the Druid astrologers, coincided very closely with the period of his

        his march of conquest the more easy and rapid. However this may be, <span style="font-weight: bold">it 
        was probably less the imaginary incarnation of Hesus than the actual example 
        of Alexander which afforded to Julius Caesar the precedent which he followed 
        in his own deification</span>. "When he was in Spain he bestowed his leisure 
        hours in reading the history of <span style="font-weight: bold">Alexander</span>, 
        and was so much affected by it that he sat pensive a long time, and being 
        asked the reason, he said, 'Is it not sufficient cause for concern to 
        reflect that Alexander at my age reigned over numerous conquered countries, 
        whilst I, as yet, have not one glorious achievement to boast?'"<sup>7</sup> 
        Not only the example of Alexander, but the similarity of circumstances, 
        helped to make a divinity of Caesar. After the battle of Pharsalia the 
        world was at his feet; and among the numerous potentates who were swayed 
        by his nod were many who were themselves gods, and, as such, were worshiped 
        by their degraded subjects.<sup>8</sup></span></p>

priestess), deities scarcely less than our Lord himself...As oft as the day arises, so
often do I address my prayers to them, together with offerings of frankincense. 
Shouldst thou enquire the whole of Pontus will confirm my words, and attest my

Augustus as God, or the Son of God, the Great Deity, the Heaven-born, the Divine,
the Omniscient, the Beneficent, the Just, the Long-suffering, the Merciful God</span>.  It may
serve the purposes of perversion to explain this away, it may afford a refuge for obstinacy
or delusion to dismiss it with affectations of incredulity or contempt; but this is no answer to
the fact; for fact it unquestionably is, not alone upon the testimony of Ovid, but upon that
also of numerous other intelligent, respectable and even illustrious witnesses, that is to
say, the testimony of <span style="font-weight: bold">Virgil, Horace, Manilius, Pliny, Suetonius</span> and others.  <span style="font-weight: bold">WHAT IS

candle, steeple, frankincense, rosary, cross, mitre, temples, priesthood, benefices and
ritual; in short, with all the outward marks of superstition, credulity, piety and devotion. 
There is nothing impossible about this; and the evidence of this worship is so valid,
circumstantial and overwhelming, that to refuse assent to it, is to put reason out of court
altogether.  The witnesses are not phantoms, the wild creations of credulous minds; their
writings are not anonymous patchworks, undated, unlocated and unsigned; they do not
stand unsupported by archaeology, inscriptions, coins, calendars, or popular customs; on
the contrary, they are corroborated and buttressed by all three classes of evidence.  The
witnesses are men of reputation, their writings are among the masterpieces of the world,
which it would be impossible to imitate and difficult to alter without detection, whilst the
monuments which support them are numbered by myriads and found in every conceivable
locality, <span style="font-weight: bold">from the Roman slabs in the mosque of Ancyra, to the coins rescued from
buried Pompeii; both of which, as well as a vast number of other inscriptions and

sufficed to wholly overthrow or eradicate."  [316].</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif">'When Caesar was assassinated, Augustus was still in his teens.  When, in accordance
with the Treaty of Brundusium, <span style="font-weight: bold">Augustus divided the world with Marc Antony</span>, giving to
the latter the Eastern, and retaining for himself Rome and the Western Empire, he had but
barely attained the age of manhood.  After the departure of <span style="font-weight: bold">Marc Antony</span>, one of the first
acts of Augustus was the destruction of Perugia, a city which refused to acknowledge his
authority.  The fall of this place was followed by the sacrificial Placation of <span style="font-weight: bold">Julius the
Father</span>.  In this atrocious rite, some authors allege that the consul, <span style="font-weight: bold">Lucius Antony</span>,
(brother of Marc) besides <span style="font-weight: bold">Cannutius C. Flavius</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Clodius Bithynicus</span>, and the principal
magistrates and council of Perugia, together with 300 [possible exaggeration (see 1099)]
senators and knights, were immolated as human sacrifices, <span style="font-weight: bold">upon an</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">altar of Julius,
erected for the occasion</span>.<sup>48</sup>  The greater part of the abominable auto da fé [this phrase,
apparently, is used anachronistically] was executed in the presence of Augustus himself,
whose only reply to those who implored and shrieked for mercy, was:  "You must die."</span></p>

ponder over this horrible event.  So soon as the gruesome business was over, Augustus
prepared for his own elevation to the godship.  Such of the ancient literature as was not
destroyed, was perverted, the <span style="font-weight: bold">Sibylline books</span><sup>49</sup> being among those preserved, because
they were found to contain the prophecy of his Advent ["coming or arrival"], which,
according to the subservient interpretation of <span style="font-weight: bold">Virgil</span>, was to occur this same year, that is to
say, in the consulate of <span style="font-weight: bold">Pollio</span>, A.U. 713 [41 B.C.E.], when the world would be at peace,
the temple of Janus closed, and the Golden Age would begin.  Unfortunately for this pretty
scheme, <span style="font-weight: bold">Marc Antony, grown jealous of Augustus, made war upon him</span>; and the
temple of Janus had to be re-opened; so that the god of the Western world was fain to
postpone his intended elevation until the god of the East was subdued.  The memorable
victory of Actium was won in A.U. 723 [<span style="font-weight: bold">31 B.C.E.</span>].  <span style="font-weight: bold">It was in this year that Herod is said
to have paid a relief of 800 talents to Augustus</span>, who confirmed him, for the second
time, in his vassal kingdom of Judea; an act, which the Romans called "the Grace of God,"
but which the Jews attributed to bribery at court.  In the following year Augustus entered
Asia and Egypt at the head of an immense army; when <span style="font-weight: bold">Antony and Cleopatra, in

        rebuilt Samaria, renamed it Sebastos, the Greek form of Augustus, and 
        erected therein a temple to the worship of that god</span>. Indeed he 
        repaired many places and erected temples and statues of Augustus in them, 
        and called them Caesarea, Augustus and the like. In the 192nd four-year

death.  For whipping a slave near the shrine of Augustus the punishment was death.  For
defacing a coin which bore the effigy of Augustus the penalty was death, not because it
was a coin, but because it bore the image of god.  This is proved by the next instance.  For
defacing the effigy of Augustus on a ring the penalty was death.  For accepting honours in
a colony on the same day that somewhat similar honours had been decreed to Augustus
the penalty was death.  It has been insinuated that the worship of Augustus was an idle
form, an empty, meaningless ceremony, a mode of flattery, like that alleged to be still
rendered to some eastern potentates.  To complete this assurance it will be necessary to
prove that the thumbscrew, the rack, the headsman's block, the axe, and the bloody
remains of Roman citizens stuck upon lances at the city gates, the remains of men who
had been executed for sacrilege to the god Augustus, were also illusions; that <span style="font-weight: bold">Suetonius,

words the Theos, or living god, the Sebastos, or Holy One, or else the Son of God</span>,

sacred title, or even to swear by his name.  Yet such an impetus had this worship received

perhaps to avoid a homage which he was powerless to prevent that <span style="font-weight: bold">Tiberius</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">removed to

prevent the overthrow of their republican institutes or resist the erection of the Hierarchy,
<span style="font-weight: bold">they accepted from their tyrants a form of religion so impious and degrading as to
speedily disgust the better classes of citizens and turn them against a government
in whose establishment they had formerly taken an active and patriotic part</span>.  This
feeling found popular echo in distant provinces, like <span style="font-weight: bold">Judea</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Britain</span>, and it led to those
frequent insurrections which distinguished the first century of our aera.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The religion
which led to these insurrections was the worship of Caesar as the Creator</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">This is
the pivot upon which turned the history of the Roman world for many centuries; yet only the
faintest allusions to it will be found in our standard works of reference</span>.  In the present
treatise the subject will be brought into relief.  It will then be perceived that the true
grandeur of christianity and the moral lessons of its conquest over paganism, have been
hid from sight by a false history of the Roman religion and its development.  No greater
struggle has ever been fought, and none so belittled by petty conceits and fables.  Not only
this, but if the edifice by which the aims of civilization are supported continues to be poised
upon the flimsy [?] foundations which the medieval monks constructed, it is exposed to the
risk of falling beneath the blows that criticism and satire may reserve for its more
vulnerable elements...</span></p>

located this reference], (p. 3,) are contained the proofs that <span style="font-weight: bold">Augustus</span>, in order to support
his claims to divinity and make good his pretence of being that Son of God whose advent
["coming or arrival"] had been predicted in the sacred books both of the Orient and
Occident, <span style="font-weight: bold">sank 78 years from the aera of Rome, which he reduced from 816 to 738
years before what is now known as the Christian aera</span>.  The same work also contains
the proofs that in a long subsequent age the <span style="font-weight: bold">Latin Sacred College</span>, following the evil
example of Augustus, and with a like deceptive object, <span style="font-weight: bold">added 15 years to the ancient
calendar of Rome, thus removing the Foundation, or Year of the City, to B.C. 753,

        An attentive examination of the details, real or fabulous, relating to

ecliptical cycle</span>.  This cycle not only comprised the whole round of eclipses; it also
renewed all the lunar festivals on the same days of the 36-day month.  It was therefore the
Metonic cycle, so to speak, of the ten months' year.  The astrological extension of the
ecliptical cycle consisted in assuming that when the cycle has recurred as often as there
were days in the civil month, the celestial system would be renewed; and moreover that
after ten such renewals, the system would come to an end.  <span style="font-weight: bold">THE BASIS OF ASTROLOGY
IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH; IT IS ONLY THE SUPERSTRUCTURE THAT IS FALSE;

Deity, a new Messiah, would visit the earth and bring to it love, peace and happiness.

        [Emperor 284 - 305 C.E. (245 - 313)]. By dividing the imperial government 
        into four departments, two to be ruled by Augusti and two by Caesars; 
        by removing the seat of government from Rome—his own capital being 
        established at <span style="font-weight: bold">Nicomedia</span> in Galatia,<sup>37</sup> 
        and that of <span style="font-weight: bold">Maximin</span>, the other

        extinguishing what remained of the Roman senate; by disbanding the praetorian

        his</span> [<span style="font-weight: bold">Diocletian</span>] <span style="font-weight: bold">oath 
        of office on the Sun; by solemnizing his treaty with the Nubians in the 
        name of the same deity</span>; and by numerous other public acts, he plainly 
        evinced an intention to essentially and permanently alter the Roman religion 
        as well as its system of government. But a national religion is not so 
        amenable to alteration as some enthusiasts pretend. <span style="font-weight: bold">Although 
        Diocletian's attempt to revive the solar worship was preceded by that 
        of Elagabalus, it completely failed</span>. Religion, in common with all 
        the other institutes of the Creator, has to obey the laws of evolution 
        [?]. Among other innovations Diocletian abolished the custom of dating 
        the aera from Julius Caesar or Augustus, and ordered it to commence with 
        his own reign, the first day of which was September 17th, A.D. 284.<sup>38</sup> 
        This was afterwards shifted to September 29th, the day we now call <span style="font-weight: bold">Michaelmas</span>. 
        The aera of Diocletian was long in use throughout some portions of the 
        Roman world, and it is still used by the Christians of Nubia and Abyssinia. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold">The Church of Rome endeavoured to bury

requiring that in the first place one-fifth of all the treasure found or captured in the lands

Romans of moral character.  Whether of Italy or Britain, they have rendered the name
of Roman pagan, synonymous with everything that is vile</span>.  The bitter invectives of
<span style="font-weight: bold">Juvenal</span>, unmistakingly aimed at the abominations of the capital, these bigots have applied
to distant <span style="font-weight: bold">London</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">York</span>, which probably barely heard of them.  In this manner they
have blurred and falsified all the lines of history.  But no unprejudiced person can read the
fond and affecting inscriptions upon the ancient tombs and altars of Britain, without giving
the provincial Romans credit for as much truth, love, and piety, as are to be gleaned from
similar evidences of our own times.  Mr. <span style="font-weight: bold">Wright</span> publishes a great number of these
inscriptions, and the student who wishes to derive from original proofs a just estimate of
Romano-British character, must read them for himself.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Whatever may have been its
rites, customs, or ceremonies, the monuments of Britain indicate that, in practice,
the Roman religions promoted the observance of as much tenderness, filial
affection, benevolence, pity, charity, decency, and sobriety, as are known to prevail
in the same places at the present day</span>.  There, indeed, came a time when all these moral
traits grew fainter, and the social bond itself was dissolved; but this appears to have been
no more caused by the ancient beliefs, than the brutality and depravity of the middle ages
were caused by christianity."  [30].</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif">any kind, has yet been 
        found which contains any certain evidence of, or allusion to, christianity. 
        The Romans entered Britain both before and after the beginning of our 
        aera. They came not only from Rome and Byzantium, but also from numerous 
        other parts of the empire. <span style="font-weight: bold">The temples 
        and tombstones of the Romans, their altars, graves, personal relics, coins, 
        furniture, decorations, all prove that christianity was unknown</span>. 
        Down to the moment when the troops departed from Britain, the people offered 
        sacrifices and inscribed their last pious wishes to <span style="font-weight: bold">Jupiter</span>, 
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Bacchus</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Serapis</span>, 
        or <span style="font-weight: bold">Mithra</span>, gods who had been worshipped 
        from very ancient times. The degrading worship of emperors had fallen 
        into disuetude [desuetude ("discontinuance", etc.)]. Sir <span style="font-weight: bold">Francis 
        Palgrave</span> [1788 - 1861], after a careful examination of all the 
        literary materials bearing upon the subject, finds no valid evidence that 
        the British tribes ever heard of christianity. The earliest evidences 
        of christianity in Britain relate to the romanized Britons, chiefly of 
        the higher ranks, and (he might have added) therefore those to whom the 
        official religion of emperor-worship was most repugnant.<sup>9</sup>"

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'The Rev. Dr. <span style="font-weight: bold">Bruce</span> sums up the case in a few words.<sup>10</sup>  After admitting the
absence of any Christian memorials in the Roman remains he says:  "We meet the cross in
several of its forms, but it is admitted on all hands that <span style="font-weight: bold">the cross and even the famed
cipher P</span> [(cannot reproduce) P with * below stem of P] <span style="font-weight: bold">or X P</span>  [Chi-Rho?] <span style="font-weight: bold">are emblems
older than christianity</span>.  Their appearance on monuments prior to the time of
<span style="font-weight: bold">Constantine</span> cannot be regarded as emblems of the Christian profession.  Neither do we
meet with any other indication of the adoption of the verities of revelation by the romanized
Britons."'  [31-32].</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'<span style="font-weight: bold">The substance of all the antiquarian evidence and of all the valid literary
evidence on the subject is that CHRISTIANITY DID NOT MAKE ITS APPEARANCE IN
BRITAIN UNTIL THE PERIOD OF POPE GREGORY'S MISSIONARIES IN THE SIXTH
CENTURY, and that it did not obtain a general footing in the Island before the aera of
Charlemagne </span>[King of the Franks 768 - 814; Emperor of the West 800 - 814 (742 - 814)]. 
When it did appear, it made its mark upon every institution of society.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The distinguishing
trait of the Christian religion—one that some doctors of divinity seem to have
strangely overlooked—is its capacity of improvement, its adaptability to the ever
changing conditions of society, and to the varied wants and aspirations of man</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">This
is the Roman part of it</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">the legendary part is <span style="font-weight: bold">Buddhic</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Gallic</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Jewish</span></span>; the ceremonies

his "vehicle."  <span style="font-weight: bold">The Judean dare not alter the law of Moses, nor the Moslem the Koran</span>.

Nearly every Egyptian representation of a god (there are hundreds of them in the <span style="font-weight: bold">British

These works of art are ascribed to aeras many centuries B.C.  There are Gallo-Greek

belonging to the fourth and fifth centuries B.C.  The Ptolemaic Egyptian coins are also
stamped with crosses as sacred symbols.  <span style="font-weight: bold">There are Roman coins older than the
Christian aera which display the cross surmounting the sacred hat of the pontifex

symbols, not only of christianity, but also of other religions, were used very anciently in the
same way, and often with the same meanings that they still retain.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The sacerdotal</span>

        and infants were left to perish. Many a Gothic settlement between the 
        Walls was destroyed in these forays. Smoking ruins, pools of blood, disfigured 
        corpses, the agonized cries of the wounded, and a troop of horse retreating 
        in the distance, driving before them a herd of cattle laden with young 
        women, boys and other spoil, told the piteous story. Indeed it was <span style="font-weight: bold">the

sixth or seventh century, it appears that the practical sovereignty of the Island passed,
almost without a struggle, from the hands of the imperial government, or its agents, or
vassals, into those of a number of petty Gothic chieftains, who occupied the places of the
departed Romans and ruled in the names of their emperors; that <span style="font-weight: bold">some of the Roman
cities remained independent of either Gothic or imperial government and continued
to practise the ancient religion of Rome until the seventh century</span>; and that the so-called Anglo-Saxon invasion is essentially mythical.<sup>6</sup></span></p>

historian of the 6th century".  "A monk, he founded a monastery in Brittany...." (<i>Encyc</i>.

and Britain from the most ancient times; nor of the subdivision and feudal government of
Britain; nor of the Count of the Saxon shore; nor of the insurrections under <span style="font-weight: bold">Carausius</span> and

Gothic conquest or occupation of Iestland, Saxony, Frisia, and Normandy; nor of
Theodosius Saxonicus; nor whence he derived his name; nor of the revolt of Maximus; nor,

<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The evangelization of <span style="font-weight: bold">Gaul</span> appears to have preceded that of <span style="font-weight: bold">Britain</span> by more than
a century.  <span style="font-weight: bold">The first christian chieftain of Gaul is said to have been</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Clovis</span> [c. 466 -
511 ("King of the Franks" 481)], whilst the first christian chieftain of Britain was <span style="font-weight: bold">Ethelbert
of Kent</span>, fully a century later.  The reason for this difference in time was probably the
preponderance of druidical worshippers in Gaul and of Gothic polytheists in Britain.  <span style="font-weight: bold">THE
CHURCH OF ROME, AS WELL WHEN IT WAS PAGAN, AS AFTERWARDS WHEN IT
BECAME CHRISTIAN</span> [<span style="font-weight: bold">NEWER PAGANISM</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">CHRISTIANISM</span>)]<span style="font-weight: bold">, had been in the habit of
making concessions to druidism</span>; but it had not yet learnt how to conciliate the fierce
worshippers of Woden and Thor.  The Gauls were accustomed to hierarchical rule; the
Goths refused to be forced or urged, and had to be lured into it; and, as this process was
interrupted by frequent recantations on their part, the good work went on but slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Univers', sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By the eighth century the church had conquered in Gaul, not merely, as in Britain, a
number of separate chieftains, whose fealty might be lost at any time, it had utilized the
ancient priests of <span style="font-weight: bold">Hesus</span> to evangelize (as it was deemed) an entire people.<sup>1</sup>  <span style="text-decoration: underline">The <span style="font-weight: bold">druids</span>
were not difficult to conciliate.  The restoration of their livings, the prospect of
ecclesiastical promotion, and the retention and liberal adoption of their sacred myths,
symbols, ceremonies, and festivals, such were evidently the means employed to convert
these formidable enemies of christianity into tractable followers</span>.  <span style="font-weight: bold">We do not continue to
set up Christmas-trees and mistletoe-boughs for nothing; they mark some of the
numerous concessions which our forefathers, struggling against a world filled with
low forms of religion, were obliged to make to druidism</span>.  Nor was the evangelization of
Gaul itself effected in a day.  Between the conversion [possible dates, mentioned:  496,
503, 506, 508 (<i>Oxford Dict</i>. <i>C</i>.<i>C</i>.)] of <span style="font-weight: bold">Clovis</span> [c. 466 - 511 ("King of the Franks" 481)] and
the evangelization of Gaul, two centuries elapsed...."  [146-147].</span></p>
