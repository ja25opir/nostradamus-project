    passionate about intervention for a very simple reason: intervention saved my life. My
    story is somewhat unusual, because I went further down the scale of addiction than many.
    But it is still a clear illustration of the power of intervention. In the first of this
    six-part series, I want to begin by telling you part of my story.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After years of chronic alcoholism and drug addiction, I was unable to help myself in any
    way. Although I had been a national merit scholar, president of my high school student
    association, and head of the alter boys, I was now homeless and penniless. I had a
    bleeding ulcer, a bleeding colon, and neuropathy of the legs. I was unable to eat solid
    food and I was sleeping under bushes in the city parks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I still didn’t think that I had an alcohol or drug
    problem. I just thought I had a little cash flow problem. Sitting on a park bench on a
    cold and rainy day, I thought: "If I can just get another twenty bucks together,
    everything will be all right."</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing unusual in this thought process, because
    denial is the hallmark of addiction. For me, drinking was a solution, not a problem. On
    the contrary, anyone who got in the way of my solution became a problem. That is why
    people have so little success in trying to reason with alcoholics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, suicide seemed like a logical solution. I
    didn’t understand that I had a disease, much less that effective treatment was
    available. All I could see was that I couldn’t go on, and that I couldn’t turn
    to my family and friends. I was alone in the world, bleeding internally, and wracked with
    pain. An old friend of mine had recently committed suicide, and it seemed like a good plan
    to me. I was twenty-six years old.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A miraculous confluence of events prevented my death. I had
    resolved to kill myself in the same manner as my friend, and I had made all the necessary
    preparations, including renting a dingy flophouse room to insure privacy. The next day
    would be my last, and like any good alcoholic, I decided to give myself a one-man going
    away party.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I frequently drank myself into blackouts, and that night was
    no exception. I can only report what has been told to me by others. Apparently I made a
    phone call across the country to an old girlfriend, Helen, in New York City, and told her
    about my brilliant plan. She realized that I was serious, and called my parents in
    Michigan. My mother, just the day before, had had a dream in which she heard a voice that
    told her: "You must find Jeff." Imagine then, their reaction to Helen’s
    urgent call. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents got the number of the pay phone in the flophouse
    and called me at 8:30 the next morning. I was passed out and fully clothed, lying
    cross-wise on the bed when someone pounded on my door and bellowed something about a phone
    call. I stumbled down the corridor and down three flights of stairs to the basement. There
    was a pay phone on the wall with the receiver hanging down by its cord. I picked up the
    phone and was shocked to hear my father’s voice. I hadn’t spoken to my parents
    in a year, and I was sure that they didn’t even know what city I was in. In response
    to their greeting, I said, "I cant’ talk to you now. I’ll call you
    back." I hung up the phone, held my head, and walked away.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot begin to describe the depth of my humiliation and
    depression. I couldn’t even commit suicide right! I headed out to the liquor store
    across the street, and then to the city park to drink my pint bottle of port wine out of a
    brown paper bag.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was shining and the birds were singing as I slumped
    down onto the grass to drink. The tiny park in the middle of the big city was alive with
    people going to work and taking their morning exercise. My first chug brought up bloody
    sputum, as usual, but I continued to pull on the bottle, drinking the only medicine I had.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortified and determined to carry out my suicide plan, I
    finished off the small bottle, and got down to business. I would not fail this time.
    First, I resolved to call my parents, because I gave my word, and I didn’t want to
    jinx myself by breaking my promise. Naturally, I wouldn’t say anything about my
    suicide plan, but I would get them off my back. Then, I’d go back to the flophouse
    and get down to the simple business of ending my life.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a small bank of pay phones in the corner of the
    park, and I placed a call back to Michigan. I learned later that my parents had been
    consulting with someone about intervention, so they had a new approach in talking with me.
    There was no anger or recrimination. They were very calm and concerned. Their tone was
    disconcerting to me, because we hadn’t had a calm conversation in years.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father asked me a very simple question, which momentarily
    stunned me. There is nothing magic about this question, but at the time it stopped me
    right in my tracks. He asked, "Jeff, how are you doing?"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I simply couldn’t reply. I thought to myself, "Well,
    how am I doing? I’m bleeding from both ends, I can hardly walk, and I’m getting
    ready to commit suicide. How, indeed, am I doing?"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I replied to his question by saying: "I think I
    need to go into a hospital." It was one of the most intelligent things I’ve ever
    said, and I’m not sure to this day how I thought of it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, I began a medical detox that lasted 10 days.
    I was then transferred to a 28 day treatment program. Nothing worked until I got down on
    my knees and asked God for help. I had a spiritual experience that could fill its own
    book, after which I was able to follow the directions laid out for me by the treatment
    team. I followed those directions, one day at a time, with tremendous difficulty. Reaching
    out to others for help was not something that I was used to. But the program that they
    introduced me to worked, and I have been clean and sober since October 4, 1981.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story did not involve a classic, structured intervention of
    the type that will be discussed in these articles. However, it was an intervention
    nonetheless, and it made the rest of my recovery possible. Intervention in one form or
    another has been an integral part of the recovery movement since the beginning. Bill
    Wilson did not go looking for Ebby; Ebby came to him. Dr. Bob adamantly refused to meet
    with Bill Wilson, and only relented under pressure from his wife and their friend,
    Henrietta Seiberling. And so on.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most pervasive myths in our culture is that an
    alcoholic must hit bottom before he or she can be helped. But what is hitting bottom? You
    might hear an old hand say, "I didn’t sober up until I lost everything: the job,
    the home, the wife, everything. Then they threw me in jail, and I knew I was at the end. I
    finally surrendered."</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be many things that intervene on an alcoholic, that
    will break their denial and help them to accept help. It may be the loss of a job, a
    relationship, or health. It may be a legal or financial problem. In the example above, a
    series of unconnected and disorganized interventions took place to finally break the
    alcoholic’s denial. This is commonly called "hitting bottom," but it is not
    the only way to start the recovery process.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alternative is a structured family intervention.
    Intervention is a way of raising an alcoholic’s bottom, so that they can get help
    now, before there are any more negative consequences.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife Debra and I are the authors of the new Hazelden
    guidebook on this subject. It is titled, "Love First: A New Approach to Intervention
    for Alcoholism and Drug Addiction." In it we ask a simple question: "If
    alcoholics and addicts won’t accept help until they’re ready, what will it take
    to get tem ready?"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for an alcoholic to hit bottom can be dangerous, or
    fatal. In the forward to our book, former Senator George McGovern talks about the tragic
    death of his daughter Terry as a result of her alcoholism. He writes: "…we were
    repeatedly told by well-meaning, supposedly informed friends that we would have to wait
    until Terry really ‘hit bottom.’ The trouble is that when she ‘hit
    bottom,’ she died."</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone you love is suffering from addiction, whether this
    means alcohol, prescription medication, street drugs, or destructive behaviors, there is
    something that you can do about it. You may not be able to control another person’s
    actions, but you can have a tremendous influence.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, learn about the illness. Knowledge is power when
    dealing with this disease. Next, identify and stop your own enabling behaviors. These are
    often subtle and unconscious. Most families, operating out of simple love and concern (but
    without the right information), will do all the wrong things when trying to grapple with
    this illness. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step is to put together an intervention team. This
    means contacting the most significant people in the addict’s life, and getting them
    all on the same page. Most family interventions fail because everyone has a different
    theory of addiction and a different approach to the problem. This is a recipe for
    disaster.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the intervention team is organized and committed to
    action, detailed preparations must begin. I like to say that there are three keys to a
    successful intervention: plan, plan, plan. We’ll describe these plans, and provide a
    checklist that you can consult.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the primary goals of an intervention is to preserve the
    dignity of the alcoholic. Our role is to help to help break their denial, so that they can
    make the best choice. In "Love First," we have developed a powerful new
    technique for using love to disarm the addict’s defense system, and to break their
    denial. Everyone has heard of "tough love," but with a "love first"
    approach, you may never have to resort to a tough bottom line.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have helped to facilitate interventions for many years now.
    It is a beautiful process, and one in which you, as a friend or family member, can be a
    powerful instrument of God’s love in the world. People suffering from addiction are
    not able to stop permanently on their own. And God doesn’t usually work by lightning
    bolts. He works through people. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next five articles, I will outline the process for
    planning and carrying out a structured intervention. If you have questions or comments,
    please join Debra and me in the Hazelden chat room for intervention, every Tuesday at 9 PM
    eastern. The chat room is accessible through this web site. You can also ask questions
    through our bulletin board on the Hazelden site.</p>
