<p align="center">New news from Spanish Fort, Harvey and his brother Rebel have
found the warmer weather nice and aside from guarding the new toys from their
favorite aunt, have found a little time to "two dog" it.&nbsp; Think
of it as a "brace of dogs."&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p align="center">It's springtime, graduation time and Charlie and Phthalo took a
little trip to Berkshire Mountains (Western Mass) last weekend for Nate's  sisters college graduation and they had so much fun walking around  and saying hello to everyone, and running up and down the fields.</p>

<p align="center">Their personalities are really beginning to shine as they are getting
a little older - Phthalo is really very funny, we call her the brute sometimes  because she will just barrel through anything while we are out for  walks, mud puddles, rotting leaves, bushes, anything really. Whereas  Charlie is a little more dainty, he will stop dead on the leash in  front of a puddle and try to figure a way around it, or just take a  flying leap over it.</p>

Tuesday at 20 years old and had been with his parents for 18 of those 20 years.  Eunice (named after
Pam's very special granny is twelve) and they have had her since she was a mere piglet of twelve weeks old.
Everybody misses Rudy. So does Miss Eunice.  She is a lonely porcine. Eunice is a huge Aerosmith fan.</p>

his momma Mia, around $2475.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'd like to help Mia and Stockton,

<p align="center">Mr. Farley "Bubba" Dalton was adopted and has moved to
Ocean Springs, MS with his new momma Tracy and little sister Kiddo.&nbsp; Kiddo
wasn't sure about big old Farley at first (she's a little bitty kid like her
momma) and gave him a really good "talking to."&nbsp; After Farley
understood who the boss was, everything was fine and momma says he's starting to
talk a little now and then at his new home.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll take him a little
time but Farley says he loves it and he's especially thankful to Uncle Reggie
and his family for the nice wheelchair that Farley has learned to actually spin.</p>

<p align="center">We've been promised a video.&nbsp; Here's Farley and his little
sister Kiddo.&nbsp; The picture on the right is a tired Farley and exhausted

<p align="center">A sad story from Newberry County, NC.&nbsp;&nbsp; This baby was
found along with two dead sisters in a shed.&nbsp; Left to starve and only about
4-5 weeks old and apparently dumped and blind, she'd survived by eating grass
for apparently about a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; The animal control officer tried to
save her, bottle feeding ever 2 hours and getting her ready for rescue to pick
her up.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Newberry Baby" died the second day - she just
didn't have much of a chance.</p>

<p align="center"><i>There's a special place for people who do these kinds of
cruel things.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>Annabell Baker</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Annabelle was a puppy mill rescue, coming to us with a
tennis ball sized tumor on her rear leg. She was also heavily heartworm
positive. In addition Annabelle was forced to suffer the indignity of being born
and raised in a puppy mill, and forced to be bred continually over 4 years, with
absolutely no regard for her own health.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We followed a path we thought was in her best interests,
had her spayed, and had the mast cell tumor removed, with help from Lifeline
Animal Project. She had a rough go of <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>it
from that experience, and was once pulled back from deaths door by Dr. Jackson;
(into the late hours one nite), at Dearborn Animal Hospital, in Decatur GA.<o:p>
&nbsp;</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Later came the decision to treat for Heartworms, and eight
days later she gave up her fight. Happiness came to her for only a little more
than 3 months of her life. She was thrilled just to get fresh crate beddings, we
felt she considered that a highlight in her life. How shameful that is. She did
get to roam free in the backyard, with the others, during her short freedom. She
saw the sunlight and how she enjoyed being showered at last in its warming rays.</p>

pet stores like Petland and standalone Pet Shops trading in puppies like Puppies
Galore and countless others, and “backyard breeders” who market in the
classifieds, are contributing to the outrage and bondage.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">No dog deserves to be “domiciled” in a shed or barn, or
old oil drum, and receive no love, and at best marginal, care, more likely
abuse, at the hands of their “jailers” They deserve to have freedom, and
love and live in harmony with their people.<o:p>
&nbsp;</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dogs don’t deserve to be chained, and ignored, or subject
to cruelty at the hands of humans.<o:p>
&nbsp;</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’m sure that Annabelle has more forgiveness in her heart
for those who abused her; as she waits at the <st1:place w:st="on">

Rainbow</st1:placename>

short “spring”.<o:p>

<p align="center">We're saddened at the loss of a little guy named Billy Peanuts
who had a ride out of a shelter out west.&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy's daddy passed away
and he was dumped at the local shelter the next day by the relatives where the
kind shelter people sought out a new home for Billy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was rescued
by MidAmerica Boston Terrier Rescue and was finally happily on his way, except
for that last stop at the vet's office for a vaccination.&nbsp; The vet gave
Billy what is known as a "7-way" because of the additional <b>Lepto</b>
vaccine component, a type <u>long recognized as a killer of smaller dogs, those
under 30# and Bostons in particular</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't happen often but
when it does happen and it's YOUR dog, it's devastating.&nbsp;&nbsp; About the
best you'll get from the vet is "he died from a reaction to the
vaccine."&nbsp; The vet either knew the risk or should have known the risk
at the time of the shot.</p>

<p align="center">Billy died about a week later, safe in rescue but very, very
sick and convulsing from the reaction to the shot and he's now with his
daddy.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's really nothing that could have been done for him.</p>

<p align="center">It's for this reason that virtually all knowledgeable Boston
Terrier rescues shun the 7-way vaccine in favor of the 5-way type, otherwise
known as DA<font size="2">2</font>PPv.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vaccine that killed Billy
had the "L" included.</p>

<p align="center">Few of us in rescue are vets.&nbsp; But virtually all of us can
read and this is a WELL KNOWN hazard to small dogs and unless your vet can give
you a damned good reason to include it (other than the higher cost to you), your
dog will thank you to avoid it.</p>

Fort, AL.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;Greetings from LA (lower Alabama). Wanted to let all my friends know that
everything is going great in my new home. I am living in Spanish Fort, AL (10 miles east from Mobile, AL-the real birthplace of Mardi Gras). I have a 9
year old BT brother named Rebel-who is a cool, laid-back guy like myself. Mom works in Mobile and dad is a retired, stay-at-home doggie dad. Rebel and I<br>
have the run of the house, so its sleeping, going outside and soaking up some sun rays for awhile, playing, having treats, and just chilling out. I miss
everyone at East TN rescue, but I have settled in to life on the coast. Lots of BT kisses to Joe and Debbie for taking such great care of me and I hope
all my BT buds find their own "forever" homes.<br>

<p align="center"> In 1996 when Buster was one and a half years old, I was walking at  the park.  I saw a man with a beautiful boston.  I ran to catch up with them and that started a wonderful friendship which still exists.  He later told me "that was the only time I've had a lady chase me down and it was my dog she wanted to see."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Later he brought his wife to meet me and my husband.  They interviewed us to see if we were fit in laws for their Cricket.  We passed the interview successfully and decided to have one set of puppies.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Benjamin, Sparky, Teddy and Sissy  were born Jan  1,1997.  When we took their daddy Buster to meet the kids, he turned his head and wouldn't look at them.  As they got older though he became very interested in the puppies and really decided he liked Benjamin most.  They were  allowed to come play at our house and Buster was so attentive.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We  have wonderful videos of the puppies playing with their Daddy.  We kept Teddy and Benjamin, the Rodgers kept Sparky who looked like Buster and our friend Bob Iverson adopted Sissy.   They were all spayed and neutered and Benjamin is the only one now left.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My love for these dogs was the start of ABTR and ABTR is dedicated to Teddy the white face who was lost.<br>

heart attach.</p>

the evening before on the couch with his many buds, doing as Bostons only

<p align="center"><i>Hello.  My name is Scoot.  I am a four month old Boston Terrier.  I was born with a defect in my front legs - they say it is suppose to be causing me all kinds of problems but so far I have been able to get around.  I was living with these people but they did not want me and so they were going to take me to a kill shelter.  A very nice man heard about me and he and his wife took me in until a rescue could be found.  I did not know what a kill shelter is but I do not like the word kill.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>So now I am here at the Sanctuary Animal Refuge in Florida.  I have seen two doctors already.  Dr. Fox he is very nice he wants to look at a set of x-rays and thinks my legs might be able to be fixed.  Dr. Gibson was also very nice.&nbsp;
She recommends that I go to the University of Florida to have my legs looked at so we are working on that now.</i></p>

<p align="center">My Daisy Mae who came to us as an owner surrender in June of 2005, went to the rainbow bridge last night. She would howl at us if we didn't get a treat as soon as she came in the door from being outside. She would kick up her heels when she was happy. She was happy all the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">We will miss her dearly, but I know she up there dancing and howling....Godspeed Daisy, Mom and Dad will see you again.</p>

Because of her sweet nature and generous spirit, we have been able to foster many BT's in the last four years.  She was always willing to share her momma and daddy with others in need.  She will be sadly missed."<br>

"Suki (left) came to us almost three years ago with physical and emotional problems.  She had major human trust issues even to the point of her inability to accept human affection.

<p align="center">Dave was found October 15th 1998 at Daytona International
Speedway on Dave Marcis's Real Tree souvenir trailer, where he got his name. We brought him back to
Tennessee and he was the best pit bull ever. He went through several levels of obedience school, agility and canine good citizen.
He loved everyone he came into contact with from little kids to the 85+ old man down the street.
He got sick 11/14 and died at 5am, Monday November 20th because we trusted his life to an incompetent vet.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">He was the love of our life and the spirit that kept this house alive.<br>
