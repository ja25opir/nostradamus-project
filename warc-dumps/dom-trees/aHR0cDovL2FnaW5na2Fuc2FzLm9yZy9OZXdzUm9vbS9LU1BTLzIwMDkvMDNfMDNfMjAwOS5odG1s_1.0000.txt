    <h3><strong>Kitchen-table money talk</strong>: <strong>Planning for ‘unretirement’</strong></h3>
    <p><em>By Gene Meyer</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>Retirement  used to be simple. You worked. You stopped. You stretched your pension and  savings to cover the important things in life, such as traveling, spending more  time with your spouse or spoiling your grandchildren.<br>
    </p>
    <p>That’s  all changing now. Financial services industry polls were finding, even before  the economy cratered last year, that retirees of all ages were returning to the  workforce in some form. One 2006 survey, by Zogby International and the MetLife  Mature Market Institute, found that more older retirees (19 percent of the 66-  to 70-year-olds quizzed) were returning to work than their younger  contemporaries. About 11 percent of previously retired 55- to 59-year-olds and  16 percent of 60- to 65-year-olds also chose to rejoin the working ranks.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  reasons for all this “unretiring” are as varied as the people who dusted off  their résumés. Many wanted the extra money, of course. But many also went back to  work to remain active, contribute to their communities, or pursue in second  careers some lifelong dreams deferred in their first ones.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Whatever  their reason, retirees rejoining the workforce quickly discover that they have one  thing in common: some potentially tricky financial issues that didn’t exist the  first time around.<br>
    </p>
    <p>“For  every retiree who considers a return to the workplace, there’s a critical need  to review investment, insurance and tax issues,” says the Financial Planning  Association, a national leadership and advocacy organization for the financial  planning community. “If a retired person hasn’t done so, it makes sense to  confer with a tax or financial adviser before going back on the clock.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>Picking  up a part-time job or beginning a second career after you’ve been retired  awhile isn’t as complicated as negotiating an executive job on Wall Street, of  course. But nearly every re-entering retiree needs to think about a few basic  issues. One of the biggest is Social Security. Depending on what your potential  new job pays, as much as 85 percent of your Social Security benefits may be  subject to income tax. No one will pay taxes on more than 85 percent of their  benefits, and many will pay taxes on less, the Social Security Administration  promises.<br>
    </p>
    <p>How  much you might be taxed depends on your combined income, which is the total of your  adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest from your savings, and half of your  Social Security benefits. If this total is below $25,000 for taxpayers who file  single returns, or below $32,000 for joint filers, your Social Security  benefits are tax free. Individual taxpayers with combined incomes between  $25,000 and $34,000, or joint filers with combined incomes between $32,000 and  $44,000, will owe taxes on half their Social Security benefits. Those with a  higher income will be taxed on 85 percent of their benefits.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Going  back to work can reduce Social Security benefits for 62-year-olds or anyone  else collecting benefits before reaching full retirement age (65 if you were  born before 1937, 66 if you were born between 1943 and 1954, and varying a few  months from those ages if you were born in other years). If you are drawing  early benefits and earn more than $14,160 in 2009, Social Security will deduct  $1 from your check for every $2 you earn above $14,160. The bite gets smaller  during the year you reach full retirement age. You lose $1 for each $3 over  $37,680 before the month you reach full retirement age, then have no limits on  earnings after that.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Returning  to work after you’ve retired also may affect any pension or other retirement  benefits your former employer provides. The best way to check that question is  to contact your current plan administrators and ask.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Key  points to analyze include how re-employment might affect your pension,  especially if you return to work with your former employer, and how your new  job’s health plan might affect the health benefits in your retirement plan, say  editors at Kiplinger.com. Remember the 401(k) money or IRA savings you piled up  in your first career. You may be required to start pulling money out of those  when you reach 70 ½ years of age,&nbsp; even  if you are still working in your second career. You’ll want to be aware of any  potentially changed tax bite when that happens.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And  don’t forget the small stuff.&nbsp; Returning  to work may require shelling out money again for business clothes,  transportation, caregiving and other expenses that went away when you retired  the first time. And you will have less leisure time than you may have become accustomed  to. So, particularly if its benefits are skimpy, make sure it pays to take that  new job.</p>

    <h3><strong>Home Front: Furnace flakes, powder, or rust? Check it out!</strong></h3>
    <p><em>By Don Carter</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>For  many years now, I have been finding an increasing amount of tiny white flakes  near the base of my furnace flue pipe — the point where the pipe and furnace  meet. So, during last fall’s Home Show, I stopped by the Lennox booth to ask the firm’s  technicians about it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  prevailing opinion was that the flakes are caused by condensate inside my flue  pipe. Hot gas flows up the pipe to a rooftop discharge, but somewhere en route,  mine was cooling down too much, condensing moisture similar to the way a car’s  tailpipe does. Then the condensate trickled down the flue to my furnace,  washing scale from the galvanized finish with it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another,  less likely, contributor could be natural gas additive plating out against the  moist pipe walls, then drying and flaking. Either way, there was unanimous  opinion that condensate was my problem. A three-way investigation was proposed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First,  they wanted to make sure my furnace wasn’t oversized. A furnace with too much  capacity raises the house temperature rapidly and shuts down before the flue  pipe gets hot enough to purge cold air. Before the era  of tightly constructed homes, it was not uncommon to see furnaces and air  conditioners with two to four times the necessary capacity. Even now, some  builders size heating and cooling systems by the “front-door rule” — the  largest unit that will fit through the front door. The rationale is high  profits and preventing owner complaints about inadequate capacity.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Second,  they wanted to confirm a sufficient run of double-wall pipe. After a flue  leaves the basement level, it passes inside stud walls, where codes require  inner and outer pipe walls to prevent fires. The double wall that keeps heat  away from wood also retains more heat within the pipe. I have a two-story  house, so my furnace is easily 30 inches from final discharge, with only the  pipe segments between sheetrock being double-wall pipe.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Third,  they wanted to see whether my attic exposure was too long. Once a flue clears  the upper-story ceiling, it goes back to being single-wall pipe and passes  through a cold attic to the roof. The thought was that I may have too many feet  of exposed pipe, causing it to cool down before it reaches discharge. My  furnace is in the front of the basement, but neighborhood covenants require  rooftop vents to be hidden in the back, so there is a long distance before  discharge.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Condensate  was the problem, but I will never know which condition was responsible for the  flakes. My furnace was<strong> </strong>sized  correctly, we added double-wall pipe from the furnace to the first floor, and  we insulated the attic pipe.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This  much I do know: It wouldn’t have paid to ignore the symptoms much longer  because, once disassembled, the single-wall pipe’s interior revealed red rust  and pin holes. Sooner or later, we were facing a carbon monoxide leak.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If  you see evidence of white powder, flakes or rust on your furnace or hot water  tank’s exhaust, don’t wait as long as I did. Have it checked.</p>

    <h3><strong>Lie down, be still,  heal:</strong><br>
        <strong>Taking stock during  radiation</strong> (Opinion)</h3>
    <p><em>By Barbara L. Watkins</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>When he  was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer, Gabriel Garcia Marquez said that for him,  the disease was an “enormous stroke of luck” because it forced him to write his  memoir (<em>Living to Tell the Tale</em>,  Random House, 2004). I’ll settle for a modest taking stock of my life and my  world.<br>
    </p>
    <p>One of my first insights after  being diagnosed with cancer early in the 21st century was — trite as it may  sound — how communication had changed in my lifetime. When I lived abroad for  extended periods in the 1960s, we packed our sea trunks and took off, sailing  for 10 days across the Atlantic, carrying all we would  need for that year. We did not expect to hear from anyone, except by regular  mail, unless there was a death in the family. But when I sent word of my cancer  out into the world, I received, by e-mail and phone, expressions of concern and  support within hours — from Alaska, the East and West coasts, Japan,  Ukraine, Poland,  New Zealand, France,  and Great Britain.  In one memorable instance, I sent an e-mail to a colleague friend in Florida  and then swiveled around to my office desk to pick up the phone as she called  within a nanosecond.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The communication insight seemed  less momentous, however, when I learned that within a week of Roentgen’s  discovery of X-rays in 1895, he had received 1,000 letters, and that within a  year, more than 1,000 papers on X-rays were published in scientific and medical  journals.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I have also learned of the power  and support of others who have faced the cancer challenge — work colleagues,  neighbors, friends near and far, and the amazing strength of African American  church women and their prayer cells. These prayer groups are an element of life  that I knew little about before my diagnosis.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I finally learned to do what my  mother told me to do for years: take time to smell the roses. One friend and  her partner, who are more experienced at dealing with cancer than I am,  celebrate each year’s landmark of being cancer free with a trip, dinner or  kayaking.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another friend, who is newly diagnosed,  sent me a wonderful first-person story: </p>
    <p><em>[As] I was on my way for a walk in the Fort   Worden woods, a little boy in the North   Beach park caught my eye as he  would run, then stop, run, then stop. I stopped to watch him and saw that he  was chasing a Pacific crow. The crow would land and stay in place until the  little boy came close, then it would fly again, landing a few feet away. This  game of chase lasted for quite a while and only ended when the little boy’s  mother put her cell phone away and announced that it was time to leave.<br>
    </em></p>
    <p><em>As they drove away, I realized that although the  little boy’s mother had scarcely noticed the activity, I’d been watching this  ballet for almost 30 minutes. I also was aware that I’d been smiling and  giggling throughout the performance. It was pure joy! It was such a wondrous  feeling. I realized I don’t often take time to relish joy. I know that I either  don’t look for things of joy or I fail to recognize acts of joy.</em></p>
    <p>Although I am not a religious  person, I have developed more respect for those who are, and for spirituality  in general. Recent research shows positive links between health, prayer and  meditation, including improved immune systems and fewer episodes of chronic  inflammation. <br>
    </p>
    <p>While my experiences with the  surgical, oncology and radiation aspects of cancer have been excellent, I have  grown a bit cynical about the breast cancer “cult”; the use of such terms as  “victim” and “survivor”; and the profiteering of the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For me it has become increasingly  clear that corporate and individual greed, poverty, pollution, the population  explosion, AIDS and growing numbers of individuals who can’t afford health  insurance (47 million in the United States)  are all “weapons of mass destruction.” It’s no wonder that my physician friends  support universal health insurance! My recent experience has taught me that,  more than ever before, it is our responsibility as citizens of this democratic  nation to be informed about, and confront, complex issues such as these.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Living with cancer is like entering  a very dark forest where there is no path. Dealing with our own mortality may  inspire fear, but it also provides meaning. Cancer forces us to live intensely  in the here and now — and ideally to assess how to become more fully human. I  believe that I have learned how to be more empathetic, that is, to “feel with,”  not to pity or condescend. It is our job to make the best of ourselves and to  help mend our broken world. As we lie down, be still and contemplate, we will  surely heal.</p>
