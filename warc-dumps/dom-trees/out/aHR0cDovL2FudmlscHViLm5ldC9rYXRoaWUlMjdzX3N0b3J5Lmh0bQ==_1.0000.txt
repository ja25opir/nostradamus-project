<p align="CENTER">Kathie's Story:</p>
<p align="CENTER">Misdiagnosed with Lung Cancer</p>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
</font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In July 2002, my wife Kathie was misdiagnosed with lung 
cancer in an American Cancer Society-sanctioned clinical trial. A few weeks 
later, she underwent an unnecessary $40,000 surgery from which she will likely 
never recover in full. </font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Many others could find themselves in a similar 
position. The U.S. government's National Cancer Institute is currently 
conducting a clinical trial with 50,000 subjects, 25,000 of whom are getting 
computerized tomography (CT) scans to screen them for possible lung cancers. 
Some will probably, like Kathie, be misdiagnosed. In addition to that, CT scans 
are now being increasingly given at annual physicals to screen people most at 
risk of developing lung cancer.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I have written this article in the hope that I 
can help people better understand CT and PET screening technology, permitting 
them to make intelligent, informed decisions while avoiding unnecessary pain and 
suffering. By discussing cautions that individuals may wish to consider if they 
are screened for lung cancer using low-dose helical computerized tomography 
(CAT) scans and positron emission tomography (PET) technology, I will hopefully 
help patients not familiar with these technologies better understand how they 
can go wrong. You're going to learn things here that your doctor, your surgeon 
or your radiologist might never tell you.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Prior to beginning publication of this 
article, I sent an email to people prominently mentioned in the article asking 
if they would be interested in an advance copy to read for accuracy. One person 
responding was Dr. Michael V. Smith of Atlanta, who is mentioned prominently. He 
said in an email to me of the title, "I fear that while it makes good copy this 
description will frighten the uninformed and provide unsubstantiated ammunition 
to those opponents of early detection of lung cancer." </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">It is not my intent to frighten. I hope that 
those who read the entire article will realize that my intent is to to inform, 
and that the title is an accurate description.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The story begins when I first became 
interested in lung cancer while teaching public relations classes at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Georgia. Reading about the history of public 
relations, I learned of the role played by advertising and publicity in 
promoting cigarette smoking, and of the persuasion effort needed to discourage 
people from smoking. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This interest led me to ten years of service 
on the board of directors of the Georgia chapter of the American Lung 
Association. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">After that, I served with the American Cancer 
Society in a number of capacities, including stints on the board of directors 
and the executive committee of the Georgia Unit and Southeast Divisions, and in 
a number of committee assignments. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Note that my areas of expertise are journalism 
and public relations. I'm not a doctor, and don't pretend to know what doctors 
know. I do know how to write, and have written 11 books on various subjects.</font></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font size="2">2. Meeting Dr. Smith</font></p>
</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">In the late 1990s, or perhaps 2000 or 2001, 
one of the American Cancer Society committees on which I served was preparing 
recommendations for the position the American Cancer Society should take in 
lobbying the Georgia Legislature regarding a monetary windfall coming to the 
state as a result of the master settlement with the tobacco industry. The state 
expected to receive in the neighborhood of $200 million per year for 25 years. A 
number of community leaders, including Hamilton Jordan, former chief of staff 
for President Jimmy Carter and a three-time cancer survivor, wanted part of that 
money to go to improving Georgia's cancer infrastructure.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The upshot was that then-Gov. Roy G. Barnes in 
2001 launched the Georgia Cancer Coalition, which was to be a 10-year, $1 
billion initiative to build a major cancer research and treatment presence in 
the state. Some $400 million in tobacco settlement funds and $600 million in 
federal and private money were to fund the initiative.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At one of the morning meetings of the group, a 
young Atlanta surgeon and graduate of the Medical College of Georgia, Dr. 
Michael V. Smith, MD, FACC, FACS, FCCP, came in to talk about a clinical trial 
he hoped to conduct at Atlanta Medical Center, formerly the respected Georgia 
Baptist Hospital, which Tenet had bought and renamed. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Tenet, a publicly owned corporation that 
operates health care facilities in a number of states, is the parent corporation 
that was involved in a number of unnecessary surgery cases in California.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dr. Smith had become familiar with the 
pioneering work of radiologist Dr. Claudia I. Henschke of the Weill Medical 
School of Cornell University in New York. She had for a number of years been 
using CT scans as a way to screen for lung cancer tumors in high-risk patients.
</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dr. Henschke pioneered in finding lung cancers 
in the people most likely to get them much earlier than they can be detected by 
conventional X-rays. Conventional X-rays don't detect lung tumors until they're 
about 30 mm. (the size of a quarter) or larger. CT scans can find them when 
they're no bigger than a grain of rice, a sixth of the size detectable by 
conventional X-rays.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">CT scans, like X-rays, rely on gamma 
radiation. Instead of a single picture like that taken by an X-ray machine, 
however, a CT machine takes many pictures as targets on a large hollow wheel 
whirl around the patient. The patient is examined in a series of thin slices, 
much as a loaf of bread might be sliced. In a chest scan, lung tissue appears 
black on the film produced by the machine. Blood vessels appear white. The 
radiologist reading the images or film looks for white spots that are not blood 
vessels. Those are suspect tumors. Computers assist in the recording and 
analysis of the images.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Early detection of cancer is important to 
treatment. If tumors can be detected before they've metastasized or relocated to 
other parts of the body, the job of treating them with techniques such as 
surgery, chemotherapy and radiology is much more likely to be successful. 
Success in cancer treatment is measured by five-year survival—whether or not a 
patient is still alive five years after diagnosis. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Most lung cancers are detected late, resulting 
in only 14 percent or so of all patients surviving for five or more years. Most 
die within a year of detection. But if lung cancers are detected early, 
five-year survival rates improve to 42 percent on up.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">In 1992, Dr. Henschke and her colleagues at 
Weill launched the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP). Over six years, 
they recruited 1,000 high-risk volunteers—people over 60 with an extensive 
history of present or former smoking—who were given CT scans plus chest X-rays. 
Only four of the high-risk subjects turned out to have lung cancers detectable 
by X-ray, but CT scans uncovered tumors in 27 of the subjects, including 23 
tumors at the earliest stage of development.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dr. Henschke by 1998 had shown that CT scans 
can an effective screening tool for lung cancer. Dr. Smith wanted to take her 
work a step further. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">One of the problems with CT scans as a 
screening tool is that almost half the high-risk population has fibrous masses 
in the lungs resembling cancer tumors. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Most of these masses are benign, often dating 
back to childhood when a foreign substance was inhaled and the lungs took 
protective action by encasing the harmful substance in a fibrous mass. So how do 
you distinguish the very few of these fibrous bundles that are cancers from 
those that are not?</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dr. Smith believed the answer was a new 
technology called positron emission tomography or PET scanning for short. Here's 
how it works. The patient is injected with a radioactive substance in a glucose 
(sugar) solution. Cancer cells are hungry for energy and absorb 20 times as much 
of the radioactive glucose as normal cells. Targets whirling around the patient 
in the same way a CT scanner works pick up the radiation being emitted by the 
radioactive solution. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Exactly how the PET scanner works is 
complicated, involving the annihilation of positrons and electrons with 
resulting vectored gamma radiation. Let's just say that if a lot of radiation is 
picked up by the PET scanner in the same area as a suspected tumor identified on 
earlier CT scans, then there's a fair probability that the fibrous mass showing 
up "hot" (emitting a lot of radiation) on the PET film is a cancer.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dr. Smith says he became interested in 
developing a better method of screening for lung cancer after his mother died of 
the disease. Having a parent die of lung cancer that was not diagnosed early is 
a powerful motivator. I know that, because both my mother and father died of 
lung cancer.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">When Dr. Smith became interested in using PET 
scanning as a screening tool, the technology was a relatively new tool, although 
it already had a track record in cancer diagnosis. Doctors at oncology (cancer 
treatment) centers were already using PET scanners to stage and track the 
progress of cancers that had been diagnosed in patients. The scanners were 
helpful in telling if treatment was successful (the cancer was shrinking) or, if 
instead, the cancer was growing.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I don't recall that Dr. Smith said all this in 
the ACS meeting where he spoke of his proposed clinical trial, but he said 
enough to favorably impress the committee on which I served. The upshot was that 
the Southeast Branch of the American Cancer Society eventually approved Dr. 
Smith's research plans.</font></p>

<b>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Kathie learns of the clinical 
trial</font></p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I forgot all about that morning meeting until 
many months later, when my wife Kathleen heard a promotional spot on television 
about Dr. Smith's clinical trial. She wanted us to participate. She persuaded me 
to go with her to Atlanta Medical Center, where we enrolled on June 19, 2002.
</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The person who registered us, Beatrice Saba, 
was a personable young lady visiting Georgia from Africa. She told us of the 
Tenet doctors who would be involved in the trial. One was Dr. Louis Lovett. 
Another was Dr. A. Hamblin Letton. Dr. Letton, a past president of the American 
Cancer Society, is renowned for his role in encouraging women to conduct breast 
self-examinations to detect cancer tumors. He once reportedly turned down an 
offer from President Richard M. Nixon to serve as U.S. surgeon-general. </font>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Beatrice also told us that Dr. Barry F. 
Jeffries would be the radiologist who would be reading CT and PET scans 
conducted during the clinical trial, the goal of which was to enroll 1,500 
subjects over 55 who had at least a 20 pack-year history. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">A pack-year consists of smoking a pack of 
cigarettes a day for a year. Smoke one pack a day for a year—that's one 
pack-year. Smoke two packs a day for a year—that's two pack years. Smoke half a 
pack a day for a year—that's half a pack-year. My wife Kathie and I met the 
criteria, although, like the 1.3 million Americans per year who quit smoking for 
good, we had both quit many years earlier. We were, nonetheless, among the 90 
million Americans who at one time or another had smoked.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Another thing we learned from Beatrice was 
that PET scans would be given only to subjects who had suspect lung nodules on 
their CT scans.</font></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. We attend the introductory 
seminar</font></p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On June 26, Kathie and I attended a two-hour 
"seminar" at Tenet's Atlanta Medical Center. The meeting was held in space 
provided by Tenet to GILCR for the clinical trial. It was during this meeting 
that I first realized Dr. Smith as the same physician who had talked of his 
proposed research to the American Cancer Society committee on which I was 
serving earlier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the meeting, we were told that Reynolds 
Jennings, on behalf of Tenet, had donated $150,000 to jump-start the GILCR 
screening trial. The goal of the trial, we were told, was to detect lung cancers 
earlier, so that survival rates could be improved. As of that evening's meeting, 
we learned, three cancers and three probables had been found using CT plus PET 
technologies. Subjects for the trial had to be 50 years or older, with a 30 
pack-year history. That was a little different from the 20 pack-year history 
we'd heard from Ms. Saba, but the difference seemed unimportant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the June 26 meeting, Dr. Smith mentioned 
his frustration over getting money he'd asked from the Georgia Legislature. The 
Georgia Cancer Coalition (GCC) was now disbursing most of the money Georgia 
planned to spend on lung cancer research</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A major part of the money being channeled 
through GCC, at the urging of Hamilton Jordan and other influentials, was being 
allocated to fund what Georgia hoped would be a world-class cancer research 
center at Emory University. Emory, which graduates of the rival Medical College 
of Georgia sometimes say has an edifice complex, used much of the huge grant it 
was receiving to build a building. But researchers were being hired and brought 
in, and by mid-2004 Georgia had attracted 66 of the 150 cancer researchers it 
hoped to recruit for the Emory research center. The researchers by mid-2004 had 
brought $77 million in federal grants with them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">While Emory was benefiting from the state's 
largesse, Dr. Smith's request for $1.5 million in funding had been cut in budget 
hearings to $300,000, and he had not received a single penny of that. As it 
would turn out, none of even the $300,000 would ever go to GILCR, which by July 
2004 had closed down the lung cancer screening trial.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As part of his presentation at the June 26, 
2002, meeting, Dr. Smith mentioned that Dr. Hadyn Williams of the Medical 
College of Georgia was monitoring his research. Dr. Williams, he said, had 
studied at Cornell, where Dr. Henschke was conducting her pioneering work with 
computerized tomography to screen for lung cancer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Among other comments, Dr. Smith said at the 
meeting that PET scans were 90 percent accurate in determining whether or not 
suspect fibroids in lungs were tumors. Later in the presentation, he stated that 
PET scans were 95 percent accurate in identifying cancers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for scanning for tumors, Dr. Smith noted 
that while conventional X-rays can find fibrous bundles if they are 30 mm. or 
more in size, CT scans can find fibrous bundles down to 5 mm. in size. That's 
the difference between finding something the size of a quarter versus something 
the size of a pencil eraser, as he put it. The earlier a tumor is found and 
treated, the greater the chances for successful treatment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He indicated that the ideal subjects for 
GILCR's Early Detection Initiative were individuals 55 or older, with a 30 
pack-year or more history, who had stopped smoking no more than 10 years earlier 
and had no prior cancer history. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dr. Smith indicated that while GILCR study 
subjects were experiencing no delays in getting CT scans, PET scans were a 
different case. At the time, there were four fixed and three mobile PET scanners 
in the Atlanta area. The GILCR study accessed one of the mobile scanners once 
every two weeks. As of the July 26 2002 meeting, 50 subjects in the GILCR study 
were waiting to get PET scans for suspect nodules identified by CT scans.</font></p>

<p>I was impressed with what we learned at the meeting about 
what Dr. Smith had accomplished. I still believe that CT and PET scanning can 
play an important role in lung cancer screening. At the time, of greater 
reIevance to this narrative, I thought he deserved state funding for his 
research. </p>
<p>Based on what I had learned at his seminar, I wrote an 
opposite-editorial (op-ed) piece for the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>, 
Atlanta's daily newspaper. The piece, headlined "Broken promise limits cancer 
research funding," appeared in the July 5 issue of the paper. It detailed the 
results of Dr. Smith's research (at the time, three cancers found in 250 
subjects screened), and recounted how he had been budgeted money by the Georgia 
Cancer Coalition, but that the money had not been forthcoming.</p>

<p>6. I question radiation doses</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left">Kathie and I followed separate paths for getting our 
respective CT scans. As it turned out, because of what turned up in our lungs at 
each test, we both got a CT scan, we both got a subsequent CT scan with contrast 
(more powerful) and we ultimately each got a PET scan. Except for her PET scan, 
which was done at a mobile unit at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, all of our 
tests were done at Atlanta Medical Center in downtown Atlanta.</p>
<p align="left">When I went for my CT scans, I made a point of asking about 
radiation doses. I was surprised to learn that the Atlanta Medical Center 
technicians were unable to answer my questions. They didn’t know what the 
radiation doses were. </p>
<p align="left">I didn’t find out until much later that CT scans expose a 
subject to significantly larger doses of radiation than X-rays. </p>
<p align="left">For those interested, One measure of radiation dosage is the 
REM. A standard or conventional X-ray likely exposes the subject to 1/100th of a 
REM (0.01 REM). A typical adult CT brain scan results in the patient absorbing 
about six REMs, or 600 times as much radiation as an X-ray. A chest or abdominal 
scan exposes the patient to two to three REMs, or 200 to 300 times the gamma 
radiation of an X-ray.</p>
<p align="left">More accurate estimates of radiation danger in the U.S. come 
from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). A panel of NAS researchers reports 
every decade or so on radiation hazards. The panel issued one report in 1990, 
and another more recently in 2005. In the latter, it concluded that even very 
low doses of radiation—from X-rays, and from closely related gamma rays emitted 
by nuclear materials used in medicine and some commercial products—pose a risk 
of causing cancer over a person’s lifetime. The most recent report of the panel, 
issued after five years of study, rejected the contention of some scientists 
that tiny doses of radiation are harmless.</p>
<p align="left">Most of us get more radiation naturally from the environment 
than we do from medical testing. Activities such as eating, breathing and 
drinking account for about 82 percent of the radiation to which we are exposed. 
The remaining 18 percent of the radiation we get comes mostly from medical 
radiation, but also from television and computer monitors. Tobacco smoke and 
some building materials can also expose us to man-made radiation.</p>
<p align="left">For its 2005 report, the NAS panel used the millisievert as 
its unit of measurement. In the United States, the average person is exposed 
annually to about three millisieverts of natural background radiation, mainly 
from the sun. A chest X-ray exposes a patient to about 0.1 millisievert, while a 
CT scan is about 10 millisieverts, a little more than three times natural annual 
exposure and about 100 times the exposure from an X-ray.</p>
<p align="left">The NAS panel estimated that one out of 100 people exposed to 
100 millisieverts of radiation over a lifetime probably would develop solid 
cancer or leukemia, and about half of those cancers would be fatal. An 
additional 42 cancers might develop in the same group of 100 from other causes 
such as genetics, workplace chemicals and environmental contaminants. That 
places the risk of getting cancer from medical radiation low. Doctors and 
radiologists argue with good reason that for patients at high risk of disease, 
the radiation dose from a CT scan is less a risk than not detecting, diagnosing 
or staging the disease. </p>
<p align="left">The NAS scientists concluded, nonetheless, that medical 
radiation is dangerous, and can, among other things, cause cancer. The risk is 
greater for those who get a large number of tests involving radiation. </p>
<p align="left">The use of medical radiation is on the rise. Where CT scans were once used 
largely for diagnosis, they are now being used widely for screening as well as 
for diagnostic purposes. About 45.4 million CT scans were performed in 2002 
nationwide, up 14.6 percent from 39.6 million in 2001. The number of PET scans 
performed in 2003 was up an estimated 58 percent in 2003 from 447,200 in 2002.

<p>7. The mystery of the dread diagnosis</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>By July 9, Kathie had been given a CT scan plus a CT scan 
with contrast at Atlanta Medical Center, plus a PET scan, the last provided at 
Northside Hospital.</p>
<p>Kathie and I were covered by my medical insurance, so the 
cost of our scans were paid by that. </p>
<p>We met with Dr. Smith at his office on July 9. She was told 
then that she had three suspect nodules in her lungs. Of the three suspect 
nodules, PET scans had eliminated two of the three as cancers, and had probably 
eliminated the third, we were told. Kathie taped the conversation. I took some 
digital photos of the films from her scans as Dr. Smith discussed them with us.</p>
<p>She and I went on to an appointment she had with her 
pulmonologist at St. Joseph's Hospital. </p>
<p>Three days later, on Friday, July 12, Dr. Smith called. He 
had bad news regarding that third suspect nodule in the right hilum area of her 
lungs. He now believed the third abnormality in her lungs was a cancer requiring 
surgery. </p>
<p>Someone had determined that this nodule was malignant. Dr. 
Smith did not tell us who had made that diagnosis, only that it had been made by 
"the best radiologist he knew."</p>
<p>I doubted at the time that Atlanta Medical Center radiologist 
Dr. Jeffries, who was voluntarily reading the GILCR CT scans for those without 
insurance, was the one. He had earlier complained about the quality of Kathie's 
CT scans which we had discussed with Dr. Smith on July 9. If he had diagnosed 
the suspect masses as cancers, or even suspected that they were cancers, we 
likely would have heard about it on July 9, not three days later, on July 12.
</p>
<p>After reviewing my notes and Kathie's tapes, I decided Dr. 
Smith must have asked someone else to look at her films. </p>
<p>Who had made the determination of malignancy? Was it Dr. 
Henschke of the ELCAP studies at Cornell's Weill Medical Center? Dr. Smith had 
mentioned that film from his study was being reviewed by the participating ELCAP 
people at Cornell. Could it have been Dr. Hadyn Williams of Dr. Smith's alma 
mater, the Medical College of Georgia? Dr. Smith and others had indicated that 
Dr. Williams, who had studied at Cornell before moving to Georgia, was involved 
in the GILCR study.</p>
<p>As of this writing, I don't know who changed the earlier 
diagnosis. We'd both really like to know. I think Kathie has a right to know. 
She's the one who underwent unnecessary surgery as a result.</p>
</font></font></font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font face="Birch" size="6"><font face="Arial" size="2">From July 12 on, things began to progress rapidly, pretty 
much out of our control. We were at the mercy of medical professionals who knew 
a lot more than we did.</font></font></font></p>

Kathie's story: Even radiologists get it wrong when reading CT and PET scans</b></font></p>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">
<p align="left"></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On July 16, while we were waiting for a test procedure to be 
performed on Kathie, we both read an article by David Wahlberg in the <i>Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution</i> about body scans for cancer that gave us pause. 
Headlined "Inside Story," it argued that CT scans for hidden diseases can save 
lives, but that many physicians felt drawbacks of the scans outweighed their 
worth. The article pointed out that a spot in a lung, kidney or liver that shows 
up on a CT scan could be a cancer, but was more likely to be a harmless tumor or 
a scar from an infection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A related story in the same paper detailed the experiences of 
Dr. William Casarella, head of the radiology department at Emory University's 
Medical College in Atlanta. Dr. Casarella, who is in charge of overseeing the 
reading of CT scans at Emory Hospitals, had undergone a screening CT scan that 
turned up suspicious masses in his left kidney, his liver and his lungs. As a 
result of these suspicious spots, he had subjected himself to a number of 
painful, probably unnecessary procedures and surgeries. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I did not realize until I reread Dr. Casarella's story two 
years later that it had contained a warning Kathie and I might have heeded if 
our doctor had explained the significance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Among the things that had turned up on Dr. Casarella's 
full-body CT scan, in his own words, were seven or eight spots on his lungs. To 
get more information, he had undergone a second, more detailed CT scan of both 
lungs, which was inconclusive. "After that," he wrote, "we did a PET scan to see 
if the lesions were active in taking up glucose, which would mean they are 
cancerous. There was no uptake, but the lesions were at the limits of resolution 
for current PET scans, so it wasn't really that helpful." Dr. Casarella went on 
to explain that he could have followed the fibroids with periodic CT scans to see 
if they grew, which would indicate malignancy. But he decided instead to have 
the lung lesions biopsied surgically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before the operation, he had blood tests, a pulmonary 
function test and a cardiac stress test. Then, during the surgery, he said, 
"they made a 6-inch incision on the side between the ribs. They deflated my 
lungs so the surgeons could feel it and find the nodules. They cut out three 
lesions, which showed I had histoplasmosis, a benign fungus infection that had 
healed itself. Millions of people have this and never know it." His bill for the 
needless surgery and hospital stay was $47,000</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It would turn out that Kathie would be one of those millions of people who 
underwent a similar needless surgery, and she was being rushed toward it at a 
relentless speed. We were, unfortunately for Kathie, too naive to ask that 
if even expert radiologists were being confused by CT and body scans, what were 
our odds?</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p><b>9. The bronchoscopy</b></p>
</font>
<font face="Birch" size="6">
<font face="Bookman Old Style">
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">We'd asked Kathie's pulmonologist to perform a bronchoscopy 
in the hope that it would confirm or eliminate the need for surgery on Kathie's 
suspect cancer. In a bronchoscopy, a thin tube containing fiber-optic strands is 
inserted into the bronchus of the patient's lungs. The doctor can use the 
instrument to examine the larger passages of the lungs. If a cancer was indeed 
growing in the right hilum area of Kathie's lungs, it was possible the cancer's 
presence could be seen by the doctor through the bronchoscope.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The bronchoscopy was performed on July 16. The doctor played 
back the images for me after the procedure. No cancer was detected. That didn't 
mean there wasn't one—just that it was not detected by examination of the 
bronchus with a bronchoscope. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Smith felt the bronchoscopy left surgery as the only 
viable way to confirm the cancer and begin treating it. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Kathie's pulmonologist disagreed. He thought it would be more 
prudent to wait for three months or so for another CT scan to see if the suspect 
mass had grown, eliminating the need for surgery to prove that the suspect mass 
was a cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I'd been reading what I could to update myself about cancer 
and treatment in the free time I had in these days. Kathie and I asked Dr. Smith 
if it wasn't more practical to get a tissue sample for biopsy using fine needle 
aspiration rather than radical thoracic surgery. Dr. Smith warned against that, 
cautioning that the needle used could drag cancer cells with it as it was 
withdrawn, spreading cancer cells behind it. </p>

<p><b>10. Putting together a treatment team</b></p>
</font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">We'd gotten recommendations from friends and medical 
professionals for several surgeons who, other than Dr. Smith, might perform 
surgery if it proved to be necessary. One of the recommendations was for Dr. 
John Moore of St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Moore had been Dr. Michael Smith's partner before Tenet 
lured Dr. Smith away to head the cardiac surgery unit at Atlanta Medical Center. 
As a bargaining chip in the effort to lure Dr. Smith to Tenet, Tenet had agreed 
to help him with the lung cancer screening clinical trial he wanted to conduct. 
We decided to use Dr. Moore for a second opinion on whether or not Kathie really 
needed surgery to treat a likely lung cancer, and made an appointment with his 
office.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From among the oncologists recommended to us by friends was 
Dr. Colleen Austin. Dr. Austin was also recommended by another physician. We 
made an appointment with Dr. Austin in case her assistance was needed to treat 
Kathie with chemotherapy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By this time, Kathie and I were talking to anyone and 
everyone who had experience in dealing with lung cancer. One of our neighbors, 
with whom we had regularly played bridge, had died of it, but only after a 
valiant fight that considerably extended his life expectancy. His family gave us 
information on immune system stimulants he had taken in massive amounts to 
enhance his body's ability to fight his cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Because Kathie hadn't been conclusively diagnosed with lung 
cancer yet—there was no biopsy of tissue to confirm a cancer—it didn't seem 
critical that we take that course. I went to the health food store where the 
neighbor had purchased his supplements. I learned that there were a mind-numbing 
number of immune system stimulants. After talking with the store manager, I felt 
he seemed more interested in selling expensive products than in discussing how 
they work, so we put that on hold.</p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p><b>11. The pressure is on</b></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Although we had gotten a few warning signals, we kept coming 
back to Dr. Smith's declaration that CT scans plus a PET scan could identify a 
suspect cancer with 90 to 95 percent accuracy. That meant the odds of what had 
turned up in Kathie's scans were 90 to 95 out of 100 that a cancer was involved. 
And, as Dr. Smith warned me on several occasions: "Noel, this is a cancer!" </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">With a growing cancer—especially an aggressive small cell 
lung cancer—your odds of survival go down with each passing day, with each 
doubling of the cells in the tumor, with each possibility that the cells are 
spreading to other parts of the body.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We were scheduled for a July 23 pre-operation meeting at St. 
Joseph's to finalize Kathie's surgery, now scheduled for 7:30 a.m. on July 29. 
The date had been moved up because Dr. Smith was leaving town for a trip 
immediately after that, and wanted to complete the surgery before he left.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our first appointment with thoracic surgeon Dr. John Moore 
for a second opinion on July 24 was canceled because he was running late. 
Frustrated that critical decisions had to be made quickly, and time for 
gathering information was running out, we rescheduled for the morning of July 
25.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">At 1:30 on the afternoon of the 24th, Kathie underwent a

<p align="JUSTIFY">After that, we met with the anesthesiologist who went over 
with us the procedures that would be followed to render her unconscious for the 
surgery. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Kathie was particularly apprehensive about the discussion of 
how her lungs would automatically collapse when the surgeon opened her chest 
cavity. She looked pretty much like a deer caught in the headlights of an 
approaching car.</p>

<p><b>12. We attend the GILCR seminar again</b></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the evening of July 24, we attended for the second time 
the two-hour seminar at GILCR that we had attended a few weeks earlier. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This time, our daughters and their significant 
others—husbands and boyfriends—attended with us. Like us, they wanted to learn 
all the could about lung cancer and how it might be affecting Kathie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">My training as a journalist—I've been a newspaper reporter 
and editor, have a master's in journalism and taught journalism and public 
relations at two major universities—had led me to take copious notes at the 
first seminar, before Kathie's diagnosis. This night, with surgery in the 
offing, I took far more notes than before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dr. Louis Lovett, first on the program that evening, 
mentioned that Tenet's Atlanta Medical Center was one of only ten centers in the 
United States screening for lung cancer using CT and PET technology. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mention was made at the meeting of the pioneering work of Dr. 
Hadyn Williams, chief of nuclear medicine at the Medical College of Georgia, who 
had worked with Claudia Henschke at Cornell, and Dr. A. Hamblin Letton. Mention 
was also made of pioneering work in Japan at Nippon Kyobu Geka Gakkai Zaoshi 
(did I spell that right?) in the use of PET scanning in lung cancer screening 
and diagnosis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for the GILCR screening study at Atlanta Medical Center, 
we were told that 275 patients had by this time been enrolled, and a total of 
four cancers had been found in the high-risk subject group. Mention was made 
that while PET scanning was not yet approved by the medical profession or 
insurance companies as a screening tool for lung cancer, it was approved for 
staging firmly diagnosed cancers. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The statement was again made that PET scanning was 95 percent 
accurate in diagnosing lung cancers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The urgency of treating suspect cancers was emphasized in the evening 
presentations. Data were presented warning that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
tumor cells divide on average every 99 days, in a range of 90 to 120 days. In 
the case of more aggressive small cell lung cancers (SCLCs), doubling of cells 
occurs every 26-30 days. Survival rates are greatly improved if lung cancers are 
detected and treated early, before metastasis.</font></p>

<p><b>13. The second opinion: Another warning</b></p>
</font>
<font face="Birch" size="6">
<i><font face="Bookman Old Style">
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font></i>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the morning of June 25, Kathie and I met with Dr. John 
Moore for a second opinion. He pointed on Kathie's CT scan films to two masses 
in the upper lobe of one of her lungs, one of normal lumpy shape, the other 
dumbbell shaped. The masses were in the area where the trachea splits into the 
two bronchi.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Moore said that he and Dr. Smith disagreed on the 
efficacy of PET scanning. He was not as big a proponent of PET scanning as was 
Dr. Smith, his former partner. He said he thought there was a 60 percent to 65 
percent chance—at best a 70 percent chance—that the masses in Kathie's lung were 
cancer. He emphasized that inflammations of the lung can register as false 
positives for cancer on PET scans.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">He then said that if a mediastinoscopy had turned up negative 
results, he'd go ahead with a thoracotomy. He thought getting tissue biopsied 
was more important than a positive PET scan.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">He went on to discuss survival rates. Surgery is performed on 
many stage IIIA cancer patients, and on some IIIB patients, he said. Kathie was 
thought to be a stage IIIA. Dr. Moore then returned to the subject of accuracy 
of PET scans. Four years earlier, he said, he had heard radiologists say PET 
scans were the greatest thing ever. But he didn't think PET scans were as 
accurate as once held. Prayer, on the other hand, he felt to be positive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I think now that Dr. Moore was trying to warn us, albeit 
indirectly, that he was suspicious of the GILCR study. I don't know that to be 
the case—it's just an impression I now have. At any rate, we pressed him. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What did he recommend, we asked? </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">He answered that if a mediastinoscopy—a medical procedure to 
biopsy the mediastinal lymph nodes for the presence of cancer requiring a day or 
two at the hospital— came up negative, then a pulmonectomy would be advisable. 
He himself would more than likely do a lobectomy if a mediastinoscopy did not 
indicate a cancer. A ventilation perfusion scan before the pulmonectomy surgery 
would be needed to assure that the patient could withstand the aftermath of a 
lobectomy. Kathie's pulmonologist should be consulted, he advised.</p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the afternoon of June 25, Kathie, two of our children and 
I went to Dr. Smith's office for the pre-op consultation. He was busy talking to 
some medical students and was an hour and a half late for the appointment. The 
children, who had come with us and had to get back to jobs, were ready to leave 
when he finally arrived. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the consultation turned out to be the 
signing of surgical consent forms, although Dr. Smith answered some questions 
and briefly discussed the results of several tests Kathie had taken, including 
maximum oxygen uptake. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">He said the operation would take 35 minutes to one hour to 
get epithelial squamous cells for examination, plus another hour and a half if 
he had to do a resection. He mentioned that PET scans were 94 percent accurate 
for detecting lung lesions, and 88 percent accurate for detecting metastasis to 
lymph nodes. Kathie's PET scans indicated two tumors plus metastasis.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><u>This was the last chance for Dr. Smith to talk about the 
serious consequences of the operation. This is important. He never told us the 
mortality statistics for the kind of surgery Kathie was about to undergo. Nor 
did any of the other doctors with whom we consulted. So I'll tell you what none 
of the doctors would tell us. Of those over 65 who undergo a partial lung 
removal, five percent die. Of those over 65 who have a full lung removed, 16 
percent die.</u></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We did know by the end of this meeting from email exchanges with 
Dr. Smith, telephone conversations and the pre-op consultation that there would 
be two stages to Kathie's surgery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the first stage, a mediastinoscopy would be performed. A 
small slit would be made in the area of the breastbone. An instrument would be 
inserted that permitted the doctor to look at the mediastinal lymph nodes, and 
take a tissue sample from them for biopsy. If the mediastinoscopy was negative 
for cancer, we were told, the next step would be a thoracotomy. This involved an 
opening of the chest cavity between two of the left ribs. The lungs would 
collapse as soon as the surgeon's opening broke the pleural membrane, and with 
it the vacuum inside the thoracic cavity. A portion of the lung where the 
suspect tumors were located would be removed, and the suspect masses would be 
biopsied for cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><u>Kathie is still of the opinion that if the mediastinoscopy 
was negative for cancer, the first surgery would end there, and she would be 
awakened to go home after a day or two. A second surgery would follow if the 
tumors grew.</u></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><u>While she thinks that, according to my notes, the plan was to 
perform both a mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy to remove the suspect tumors, 
thereby saving her the stress of two separate anesthesiologies.</u> </p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Kathie's surgery was performed as scheduled on the morning of 
July 29. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At about 11:45 a.m., Dr. Smith came to the waiting room to 
inform assembled family members that he had performed a wedgectomy and removed 
some inflamed tissue elsewhere in the lung. All the tissue was negative for 
cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Many tears were shed by the daughters, who had been very 
frightened and were relieved and overjoyed to learn that their mother's biopsies 
were negative.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Smith said immediately after the surgery that the false 
positive for lung cancer was the result of an aspergilloma infection that Kathie 
had. </p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">"As 
you recall her biopsy did diagnose an aspergillosis infection in her lung which

infectious disease specialist. This would have gone undetected had it not been 
for her participation in the lung cancer study." </font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">In actuality, two rare disease specialists with offices at 
St. Joseph's Hospital were involved in culturing the tissue removed from 
Kathie's lungs. It takes a number of days to try to culture and confirm 
aspergillosis from a tissue sample. As it turned out, the specialists were never 
able to verify that aspergillosis was present in the removed lung tissue. Nor 
were they able to verify any other reasons—viral, bacterial, fungal or 
chemical—that the tissue might have shown up positive for cancer on Kathie's PET 
scans. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Be forewarned—medicine is still far from an exact science. We 
never did find out what might have fooled the PET scanner into thinking that 
what turned out to be benign masses in Kathie's lung was a malignant cancer. 
Like Dr. Casarella mentioned earlier in this article, whose scans had mistaken a 
fungus infection that had cured itself long before, Kathie may well have fallen 
into the category of the millions of Americans carrying such benign lesions that 
fool expensive medical technology.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Doctors would have us believe, from the persuasive messages 
disseminated by the public relations specialists at the American Medical 
Association, that medical mistakes are rare, and that doctors should be excused 
from the consequences of their mistakes lest the cost of malpractice insurance 
make medical practice so expensive that doctors go out of business and everyone 
is denied health care as a result. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">According to the results of a new national review of Medicare 
records by a Denver agency release in late July 2004, medical mistakes are all 
too common. The number of hospital patients who die from preventable errors may 
be twice as high as previously estimated. The finding would make medical 
mistakes the third-leading cause of death in the country, behind only heart 
disease and cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Kathie and I elected not to sue for malpractice. Better, we 
thought, to make Kathie's story public.</p>

<p align="left"><b>17. Dr. Brawley objects to the GILCR study</b></p>
</font>
<font face="Birch" size="6">
<p align="left"></p>
</font>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left">At about this time, while I was spending night and day at 
Kathie's bedside at St. Joseph's Hospital, I received an email from Dr. Otis W. 
Brawley. </p>
<p align="left">Dr. Brawley at the time was professor of medicine, hematology 
and oncology at Emory University School of Medicine and professor of 
epidemiology at Emory's Rollins School of Public Health. He was also serving as 
associate director of the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University and as 
director of the Georgia Cancer Coalition Center of Excellence at Atlanta's Grady 
Hospital, an important medical facility that, among other missions, treats many 
of the medically uninsured in the Atlanta metro area. From 1995 to April 2001, 
Dr. Brawley had served at NCI headquarters as the assistant director of the 
National Cancer Institute's Office of Special Populations Research. Before that, 
he had been a senior investigator at NCI, and from 1993 to 1995 headed NCI's 
intramural prostate cancer clinic.</p>
<p align="left">Dr. Brawley had apparently read my op-ed piece in the <i>Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution</i>. He may have taken exception to some or all of it. </p>
<p align="left">I learned that he had written a letter to the American Cancer 
Society's Southeast Division, which has responsibility for several states 
including Georgia, recommending that it withdraw its approval for Dr. Smith's 
GILCR screening study at Atlanta Medical Center. Any reservations he had about 
Dr. Smith's research study certainly deserved consideration.</p>
<p align="left">From Kathie's hospital room, I sent him an email that begged off 
answering his email, noting that I'd get back to him after my wife had 
recovered. To my regret, I never did so. </p>
<p align="left">Dr. Smith subsequently told me that Dr. Brawley had objected to 
the Cancer Society about his study. He said that he had successfully defended 
the study with ACS, which continued to sanction his work regardless of Dr. 
Brawley's objections. He also told me at a later meeting that he had lunch with 
Dr. Brawley to discuss the issues involved, but had been unable to resolve 
differences between them. I never learned exactly what Dr. Brawley's objections 
were to the GILCR study.</p>

<p align="left">18. At Kathie's bedside, I begin to question the surgery</p>
</font>
</b><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">
<p align="left"></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left">In Kathie's room in the Intensive Care Unit at St. Joe's I began 
to question what had taken us so quickly to unnecessary surgery.</p>
<p align="left">I had read about how the head of the radiology unit at Emory 
University Hospitals underwent unnecessary surgery when his CT scans were 
misdiagnosed.</p>
<p align="left">I had heard Kathie's pulmonologist recommend that we wait for 
three months to see if the suspect masses in her lungs grew instead of going 
ahead with surgery. A cancer was more likely if the tumors grew.</p>
<p align="left">I had heard Dr. Smith's former partner, when asked for a second 
opinion, express doubts about the accuracy of PET scans.</p>
<p align="left">I'm not sure if I learned of Dr. Brawley's objections to the 
GILCR study before or after Kathie's surgery. </p>
<p align="left">Despite the flags being raised, in that critical period from the 
cancer diagnosis on July 12 to surgery on July 29, we mostly heard Dr. Smith, 
the trusted physician of the GILCR study, telling us that it was urgent that the 
cancer be identified and surgically removed.</p>
</font>
<p align="left"></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left"><b>19. The immediate aftermath</b></p>
</font>
<b>
<p align="left"></p>
</b>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left">Kathie was released from St. Joseph's Hospital for home recovery 
Aug. 8, almost two weeks after she was admitted for the surgery. Her release was 
several days later than had been anticipated. Her release from the hospital was 
delayed for two reasons.</p>
<p align="left">The first was that she developed an ileus. That is a severe 
colic accompanied by repeated vomiting due to an intestinal obstruction. We were 
told it was likely due to medicines she was taking to control pain from the 
surgery. </p>
<p align="left">Dr. Smith was still out of town. Doctors covered for him, but 
were pretty much unfamiliar with Kathie's case. They visited her room at best 
once a day to review vital sign records. </p>
<p align="left">Some advice to those reading this: be careful about consenting 
to surgery, unless your life is threatened, if your surgeon is going to be out 
of town during your recovery.</p>
<p align="left">The other reason her release was delayed was a misunderstanding 
by the doctors covering for Dr. Smith during the last few days of his absence. 
For several days, they were unaware that they were supposed to be filling in for 
him. A physician from this office showed up on Aug. 7, two days late, to check 
to see if Kathie was ready to be released. We had to go looking for the same 
doctor on Aug. 8 to get her release signed.</p>
<p align="left">At home, Kathie continued to endure severe pain. She was 
administered oxygen around the clock by one machine in our upstairs bedroom, the 
other downstairs. She connected to the machines with neoprene lines hooked up to 
them and to her. Baths were initially out of the question, but I created a bench 
for her in the master bath. Using a flexible shower line that I installed, we 
were able to let her take showers at first with my help, and later alone.</p>
</font>
<p align="left"></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left"><b>20. In defense of Dr. Smith</b></p>
</font>
<p align="left"></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="left">We like to think of medicine as a science. It is that, but not a 
perfect science. Physicians make mistakes. They're human, they don't always have 
all the information they need and they're overworked.</p>
<p align="left">Dr. Smith was working on the cutting edge, in an area where 
there's a bias against doing research. Compared to breast and prostate cancer, 
lung cancer research is underfunded. It's not a particularly popular research 
area. Because most lung cancers are the result of smoking, a behavior people 
choose, there's a feeling in the general public, often reflected among 
researchers, that lung cancer is the fault of people who get it.</p>
<p align="left">That bias neglects such facts as that one in six lung cancer 
patients never smoked. It also fails to comprehend that&nbsp; those who chose to 
smoke were subject to the a hard advertising sell over the years that got people 
them hooked. It ignores the fact that much of the advertising was based on 
misleading advertising, some of it featuring doctors testifying to the health 
effects of smoking. It fails to recognize that nicotine is highly addictive, and 
it takes only two cigarettes to addict a smoker. Despite all that, there's no 
denying that a bias against finding a cure for lung cancer exists.</p>
<p align="left">Dr. Smith is to be commended for being willing to devote time to 
an underfunded and not particular popular research niche where there is a huge 
need for medical investigation.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, keep in mind that it was a radiologist, not Dr. Smith, 
who determined that something on Kathie's scans looked like a cancer.</p>
</font>
</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">21. A fourth physician questions the surgery</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On August 14, I had an appointment with our family physician, 
an internist with special skills in cardiac treatment. He told me that in his 
opinion CT and PET scans gave too many false positives, and that Kathie's 
surgery was probably unnecessary. He's normally not emotional when we talk, but 
he was quite animated in this case. I passed a vetted version of what he had 
said on to Dr. Smith in an email, asking that we talk further about the problem 
of false positives. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I added our internist to the list of physicians saying that 
the surgery was unnecessary or unwise. The list now included:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">• Dr. Smith's former partner, surgeon John Moore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">• Kathie's pulmonologist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">• Our internist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I didn't include on the list Dr. Brawley, the eminent 
physician who had headed the Prostate Cancer unit at the National Cancer 
Institute, who had questioned the GILCR research project for reasons I never 
learned.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">22. I write two books</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Kathie was recovering in her hospital room, I continued to 
read extensively about cancer, but still had little more than a layman's 
knowledge of lung cancer screening. I decided to correct that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The result was that I started an online newsletter about 
cancer research, and since July 2002, read enough about the subject to write two 
books.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first book, New Hope: Avoiding Lung Cancer, was 
published in 2003. It is primarily an argument for people to quit smoking with 
advice on how to go about it. It also discusses the efficacy of current 
technology for screening high-risk populations for lung cancer, and talks about 
measures present and former smokers can take, above and beyond quitting smoking, 
to reduce the risk of lung cancer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second book, Conquering Cancer 2003, was published 
in 2004. It is a summary of the most significant research in screening for, 
diagnosing and treating cancer announced during the year 2003. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To write Conquering Cancer, I daily read through the 
most important cancer research announcements. The most important of these 
stories I summarized in a monthly online newsletter called "Current CancerNews" 
that I posted on the Internet. Subscriptions were free for anyone who wanted to 
read the information being posted. These monthly stories I consolidated into an 
eBook to keep down the cost to those who wanted it, although a conventional 
version with paper pages is also available.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">23. Why I decided to write this article</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Early in 2004, Kathie and I were concerned when we heard that 
a routine CT scan in Wisconsin of the husband of her only sister had turned up 
something suspicious in one of his lungs. We were happy to hear a few months 
later that a subsequent CT scan had detected no growth in the mass detected, and 
that the threat of cancer was lifted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In late May 2004, Kathie and I drove to Chicago for a family 
wedding, some sightseeing and to allow me to attend the big annual book show, 
BookExpo America. From there, we drove to Wisconsin to spend a week at Fox Hills 
Country Club near Green Bay with the relatives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There I talked to Kathie's brother-in-law. It seemed to me 
that his suspect lung cancer had been treated prudently. A CT scan had found a 
mass on one of his lungs. They waited a few weeks and then gave him a follow-up 
scan to see if the mass was growing. It wasn't, so the diagnosis was "it's not 
cancer." There was no expensive PET scan as part of the diagnosis. There was no 
elaborate immediate surgery to biopsy suspect tissue, no pressure to undergo an 
excruciatingly painful surgery and recovery with the risk of never regaining 
lung capacity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Driving back to Atlanta, I thought long and hard about that, 
and began to outline this article in my mind. Soon after getting back home and 
unpacking, I decided there was a public right to know Kathie's story. Spreading 
the word might well help others from an experience similar to hers. So I sat 
down and began to write from the extensive notes I'd taken during her crisis, 
the audio tapes she had recorded at the time, the email and medical records we 
had from the period. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I did my best in telling Kathie's story to do so accurately. 
As I said in the beginning of the article, I'm a writer and journalist, not a 
doctor, so I could have gotten one thing or another wrong about the technology 
or the exact chronology. If I've said anything that is incorrect, and a reader 
notes the mistake, please let me know so I can make it right. </font> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">24. The economics of cancer screening</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, what is my opinion now of screening for lung cancer using 
CT and PET scanning? I think it's impractical. Briefly consider the economics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lung cancer is mainly the result of tobacco use. An estimated 
87 percent of lung cancers are caused by smoking. True, one out of six lung 
cancers occurs in people who have never smoked. Those cases occur mostly in 
innocent people exposed to second-hand smoke, to radon or to microparticulates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An estimated 90 million U.S. citizens are past and present 
smokers. About 23 percent of the population, perhaps 43 million people, continue 
to smoke.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A CT scan directly costs only about $75 to give. However, CT 
scans, whether for screening or for diagnosis, are profit centers for 
hospitals—and for private companies that give them from vans at places like 
churches. The mobile vans that provide them for profit generally charge $200 to 
$600 to give them. People who get them from their doctors or hospitals are 
charged in the neighborhood of $300 to $600. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CT scans for the purpose of diagnosis are generally covered 
by medical insurance, but much of the U.S. population is not insured. CT scans 
for screening purposes are usually not covered by medical insurance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PET scans are far more expensive than CT scans. They cost in 
the neighborhood of $2,000 to $4,000, although the direct cost of giving them is 
again far lower. Like CT scans, they are profit centers for hospitals and mobile 
entrepreneurs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the sake of argument, let's assume that 10 percent of the 
90 million past and present smokers are in a high-risk group—over 55, with a 30 
pack-year history of smoking—that we decide initially to screen. That's nine 
million people we'll be screening for starters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Assume further that we will initially give a CT scan to the 
nine million people to screen them for possible tumors, at an average cost of 
$450. That's $4 billion. Further assume that half of those, or 4.5 million 
people, require a CT scan with contrast at an average cost of $500 each. That's 
another $2.25 billion. Now assume that half of those, 2.25 million people, need 
a PET scan at an average cost of $3,000 each. That's an additional cost of 
$6.675 billion to screen our initial test group of nine million. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But our first-year costs are not yet complete. There will 
also be some costs for surgeons and oncologists to treat the new cases of lung 
cancer we detect. In the nine million present and former smokers over 55 that we 
screened, we might expect to find in the neighborhood of 200,000 lung and 
related cancers that would not have been found by routine chest X-rays. Assuming 
a cost of around $40,000 per tumor for surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and 
other treatment, that's another $8 billion in costs, over and above the $13 
billion screening cost. Now our total first-year cost is $21 billion. (Expect 
also that all the radiation to which we expose our patient group will cause some 
cancers that would not otherwise have occurred.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Will the nation's already stressed health system bear the 
additional expense?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, before we answer "no" to that question, consider that 
the present cost of smoking to the health system is around $75 billion per year. 
Double that to allow for other costs to the economy, such as the more frequent 
absence of smokers from the workforce because of illnesses, and smoking is 
costing the economy in the neighborhood of $155 billion per year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The $21 billion cost I roughly estimated above for screening 
a high-risk group is far less than the current cost of smoking to the economy. 
Further, it's a minuscule part of the current $1.7 trillion estimated annual 
cost of health care in the United States. But for political reasons I discuss 
immediately below, I don't believe the nation's medical provider system or 
health care insurance system will tolerate the additional cost of screening.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">25. So what's the answer?</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The answer to screening for lung cancer in high-risk 
populations, in my opinion, is not CT and PET scans. The answer is simple and 
inexpensive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first part of the answer is to get people to quit 
smoking. It's far less expensive to outlaw cigarettes than it is to treat lung 
cancer. There will, of course, be a public outcry. Only a muted cry will come 
from the smokers whose supplies would be cut off. Their cry will be muted 
because they have little political clout. A much louder cry will come from the 
tobacco industry and from the states that have become dependent on revenue from 
the tobacco companies. They have considerable influence or clout.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Short of outlawing tobacco, campaigns to persuade people to 
quit smoking are also more cost-effective than treating lung cancer and the 
other diseases caused by smoking—heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, stroke and a host of other ailments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second part of the answer, in my opinion, is serum 
testing. A number of serum tests that detect various types of cancer at the very 
earliest stages—far earlier than the cancers can be detected by CT or PET scans, 
much less X-rays—are already in large-scale clinical testing. Some of the tests 
detect predictive proteins in urine. Others detect the warning proteins of 
cancer in the blood. Some are based on proteomics (complex computer analysis of 
serum proteins), some are not. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In responding to my invitation for a copy of this article, 
Dr. Smith wrote in an email to me that "...no modality has been shown to be 100 
percent accurate in the early detection of lung cancer. I am unaware of any 
non-invasive modality for the detection of any cancer that has zero percent 
false negatives." Actually, a Colorado company that  developed a 
proteomics-based serum test claimed that in early trials it was 100 percent 
accurate in early detection of lung, prostate and breast cancer, and gave zero 
false positives. That test, the last I heard, was in large-scale testing at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, home of the Nobel Prize for medicine. 
In those tests, the results were positive but not nearly as accurate as the 
early proteomics-based tests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nonetheless I expect that it won't be long before one or another of these 
inexpensive serum tests is on the market, providing a low-cost method for 
annually screening high-risk subjects. I know Dr. Smith will share my enthusiasm 
if and when such tests become available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once an inexpensive serum test used in screening has 
indicated the presence of an early-stage cancer, it's still necessary to locate 
the cancer. Here, CT and PET scanning will likely continue to play an important 
role. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for treating the lung cancers discovered by serum tests, remarkable 
progress is being made in that area as well. It's remotely possible that 
anti-tumor agents, perhaps delivered by viral vectors, agents far less brutal 
than the surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy used today, will be 
introduced in my lifetime. I certainly hope and pray that proves to be the case.</font></p>
