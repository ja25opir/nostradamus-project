    <h1>Releases from June 30, 2009</h1>
    <h3>On turning 60</h3>
    <p><em>By Beverly Sheldon</em></p>
    <p>Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p><em>Author’s note:</em>&nbsp;  I sent this to family and friends on my 60th birthday as a way of celebrating  this stage of life.</p>
    <p>I’m  watching my grandchildren run through the sprinkler and catch their breath as  the cold drops of water tap their swimsuit-clad bodies, and I remember that  feeling of exhilaration as if it were yesterday.&nbsp;That startling sense of  wonder suddenly requires me to join them in the running and the  screaming.&nbsp;It isn’t a thoughtful decision to join them; it’s a calling  from&nbsp;my soul that says this summer ritual is not about age — it’s about  delight and the freedom to be who I am at the moment.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The little girl in me remembers how  my heart beat with excitement the first day of kindergarten, when my parents  took me to school and then left me on my own, trusting me to manage by  myself.&nbsp;I remember the anxious anticipation of making new friends, hoping  to be chosen hall leader or star-of-the-day.&nbsp;I know that anticipation now  as I think about what I will do with the rest of my life, hoping I will choose a  path that allows me to be my own “star” and a mentor for the younger ones  watching.&nbsp;I remember my father’s advice as he took me to college my  freshman year:&nbsp;“Don’t let your studies interfere with your education.”&nbsp;As  I choose the next step, I must remember what is important in life.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I remember&nbsp;the slumber  parties, the laughter, the high school and college experiences, the fun, the  fears.&nbsp;I remember believing life could be no better than the night I sat  on top of a haystack, in awe of the sky, and&nbsp;tried to touch the  moon.&nbsp;Now that feeling comes again in the moments&nbsp;I sit as a  therapist, in awe of the human spirit, honoring the people in front of me and  trying to touch their souls.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I remember looking out the window  of my parents’ home at age 16 and watching a beautiful sunset.&nbsp;Coming out  of that moment, I felt I had been somewhere above the usual.&nbsp;That feeling  has come again many times — as I watched the birth of my children, held my grandchildren  for the first time, and witnessed the passing of my mother.&nbsp;Those moments  were transforming.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I remember my first friend, and all  the family and friends who have woven their rich threads of love and friendship  into the tapestry of my life.&nbsp;Still today I feel their&nbsp;support, love,  and vibrant caring.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I remember going from  student&nbsp;to wage earner to college instructor and therapist.&nbsp;The breath  I took before each change was as deep as the breath of the 2-year-old running  toward the sprinkler.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My eyes no longer have 20/20 vision,  but I plan to continue seeing the awe of life from behind the eyeglass rims.&nbsp;My  hair has changed in color, but it still fills my favorite hats just  perfectly.&nbsp;My body can no longer win track meets, but it still feels the  joy of new challenges.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Today I am 60.&nbsp;As I watch the  outer parts of me change, our culture spends much time reminding me that I am  aging and then charges me great prices to look like I’m not.&nbsp;We spend so  much time looking for the secret of being young that we forget it is inside us  all the while.&nbsp;My birthday gift to myself will be to remember who I am.<br>
    </p>
    <p>“I look in the mirror and am always  surprised to see I’m 80,” my mother used to say, “for I always think of myself  as 35.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>I now know what she meant.&nbsp;I  remember jumping on the bed, water fights, lemonade stands, writing my first  story, and baking my first 4-H muffins.&nbsp;I remember my first kiss, my  second kiss, and all the rest that followed.&nbsp;I remember&nbsp;my first  store-bought dress, my first blue ribbon, my first job at age 15.&nbsp;I  remember as each dream was fulfilled — of being a wife, a mom, a grandma, a therapist,  a teacher, a lover, a friend.&nbsp;I also remember the disappointments and the  difficult times,&nbsp;and realize I made it through those, as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I am the 2-, 5-, 10-, 14-, 20-, 30-,  40-, and 50-year-old all in one.&nbsp;I am reminded of Russian nesting dolls,  one within another.&nbsp;I am all of those dolls, and today, as I turn 60, I  add another layer, another doll over the rest.&nbsp;Sixty isn’t so hard when I  remember what has filled the years before. I love the old dolls and I look  forward to the new ones.&nbsp;You see, the dolls are all the same,<strong> </strong><strong>except</strong><strong> </strong>the little one&nbsp;is the oldest and the most recent one is the  youngest.&nbsp;Age is a matter of illusion.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On this day of turning 60, I know I  will continue to have water fights with the grandchildren and jump with them on  the bed.&nbsp;I will still serve dessert before dinner,&nbsp;stop to cherish  the souls of others, and listen to the needs of my own.&nbsp;Right now my soul  is saying <em>Work with clay, paint a  picture, plant a garden,&nbsp;write a book, go for ice cream.</em>&nbsp;It’s  saying&nbsp; <em>Take a risk, love large, and  continue to dance in the yard on full-moon nights.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>I’m taking a deep breath and making  a run for it.&nbsp;Ready or not, here I come!</p>

    <h3>A common-sense approach to preserving precious photos</h3>
    <p><em>By Joe Padavic</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>OK, it’s time  to get out the to-do list. And there it still is, the last item, the one that’s  worked its way down to the very end (or you put it down there because it’s such  a daunting task). #126: Organize family photos!<br>
    </p>
    <p>First, you have  to ask yourself, “What’s in it for me?” Other than spending hours of your  precious time looking at old photos and going through the emotions of seeing  your grown child as a baby in your arms, or relatives who have moved on to a  happier place, or even that famous picture of you naked on the changing table,  there’s a good reason: You’ll be preserving the current quality of your images  to pass on to future generations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Are you on your  way to protecting your family’s visual history? Are your photos organized and  neatly filed, by date, with all the people identified? Are they semi-organized,  at least stored in archival-grade boxes with some identification? Or are you  still keeping your photos, good or bad, in the developer’s envelopes with their  negatives?<br>
    </p>
    <p>I’ll limit this  article to preserving images taken during the last 50 years. Anything older may  need special attention.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The first task  is to gather what you have. Then ask yourself, “What images am I going to  keep?” This weeding out is done by creating “yes-no” piles. It’s a simple  process of looking at your photos and deciding which you’ll keep and which  you’ll discard. It’s tough, but don’t reminisce. That’s what makes the task  laborious.<br>
    </p>
    <p>How you handle  your materials is important. Dirt and oils from your hands cause permanent  damage. Hold your photos and negatives along the edges or wear inexpensive  cotton gloves. Use a product like PEC-12 photo wash to clean dirt and  fingerprints from photos. Also, note that you should not store negatives with  photos. Separate the negatives and designate a place to keep them safe.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The second task  is identifying the subject of a photograph. Write as many details as possible  on the back. It’s the old “who, what, where, when” scenario. Any other information,  such as descriptions of occasions, will be appreciated by those who might own  the photo in the future. Have appropriate utensils to write gently on the back.  Use only pens or markers made specifically for photos, and make sure the ink is  dry before stacking photos. As a last resort, use a #2 soft-lead pencil.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Once the dates  have been identified, put the photos in order within a category you choose:  chronologically, vacations, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, or special  events.<br>
      Next, consider  your storage options. Improperly storing photos can cause all types of problems  down the road. Glue, tape, staples, rubber bands, and paper clips cause  deterioration, stains, scratches, and dents. Wood and wood products, such as  cardboard and paper, harm photographs and should only be used if labeled  “acid-free” and “lignin-free.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>One  consideration is how often you want to view your photos. If rarely, invest in  archival-grade photo boxes and insert acid-free separation papers between each  photo. For occasional viewing, use albums or three-ring binders. Both can hold  plastic sheets with pockets of varying sizes. If you purchase albums that come  with their own pages, make sure the pages are archival-grade and note how the  photos are to be attached. The best solution is to purchase storage materials  from a reputable supplier.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now you must  find a place to store your photos. Temperature, humidity and light are the  three enemies of photographic materials. Your basement and attic are poor  storage spots. Instead, store your photos in 65- to 70-degree temperatures and 30  to 50 percent relative humidity. The best place to find this is a bank safe-deposit  box or a climate-controlled storage facility. If you’re storing them at home,  store them in a place where <em>you</em> are  comfortable: not too hot, not too cold. A good place is an interior closet  where no furnace or chimney will share a back wall.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Water and fire  will damage photos, so keep them away from heaters, fireplaces or anyplace  prone to excessive heat or leaks. Avoid storing photos on the floor, as insects  and rodents are attracted to photographic materials.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even framing  should be done with care. Cut out the center of a mat board to prevent photos  from touching the glass and use appropriate backboards to inhibit  deterioration. For special photos, have a few copies made of the original and display  a copy. After a few years, take the copy out. If it’s faded, throw it away and  replace it with another copy.<br>
      It’s really a pretty  simple process, and the benefits greatly outweigh the effort. When you’re finished,  it’s time to reminisce and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Current and future  generations will benefit, as well.</p>

    <h3>Home front: No such thing as a perfect house</h3>
    <p><em>By Don Carter</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the building assessment business, we  periodically see senior adults preparing to leave their home of many years to  downsize, move to maintenance-by-others facilities, or seek assisted living.  Our involvement typically begins when the home they are selling is flawed and a  realty agent, appraiser or lender requires that the home be certified for  safety and code compliance.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Nearly all home transactions now require  a document known as a “disclosure statement,” a checklist form on which the  sellers are required to disclose home flaws of which they are aware. The  problem is that the seller, often having limited mobility, does not know the  home’s flaws — especially those in unreachable places such as the foundation,  basement walls, roof or exterior water control. In this case, disclosure can  easily become a driver of unnecessary expenses without a set of eyes to  differentiate what is relevant and what isn’t. A few contractors, through  ignorance or greed, will find a long list of flaws from which they recommend  repairs that go way beyond what is needed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For example, a high percentage of  basement walls crack as a result of soil movement. Kansas soils are seasonally  active, so most area homes have at least a few small cracks. Up to a certain  limit, these cracks are acceptable and require no corrective action. But since  a disclosure statement typically instructs the seller to check&nbsp; “yes” or &nbsp;“no” to acknowledge basement cracks,  “yes” can lead to a quick conclusion that something must be done. If the seller  calls the wrong repair company, its contractors will wholeheartedly agree that  something must be done. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course there are many honest repair  contractors who will only do as they are asked, but that can be a problem, too,  because the senior seller often does not know what to ask for. Moreover, once  inside the house, a contractor may notice additional things that need repair  (legitimate and honest observations). But if these findings are not related to  safety, code violations or condition of sale, they can probably be ignored,  just as they have been for many years.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are no perfect houses! When a home  reaches a certain age, buyers are not expecting perfection. Given an attractive  price, buyers are often very tolerant of imperfection. My advice to sellers is  to leave superficial repairs for the new owners, who will want things done to  their own standards and tastes anyway. When sellers can trade a small reduction  in asking price to avoid hasty and potentially unnecessary fix-up, both sides  win.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course the key here is knowledge:  knowing which problems are serious enough to veto a sale and which aren’t. We  are starting to see last fall’s mortgage fiasco driving increased scrutiny  among appraisers and lenders, making them sensitive to flaws they may have  ignored a year ago. An experienced realty agent should have a pretty good idea  which flaws need fixing and which can wait for the new owner. Ask around to  find an agent with the service history to know this business, or e-mail me for  input.</p>
