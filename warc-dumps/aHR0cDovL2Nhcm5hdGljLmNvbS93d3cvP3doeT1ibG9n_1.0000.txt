IBM had recently acquired Lotus Development Corp., another business software company, and was poised to buy SAP when Gerstner, who was then chief executive officer, vetoed the transaction and instead took IBM out of the business software business, the newspaper said.

7 (?content_id=961) ) Methods GET and POST in HTML forms - what's the difference? (http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/forms/methods.html) : In HTML, one can specify two different submission methods for a form. The method is specified inside a FORM element, using the METHOD attribute. The difference between METHOD="GET" (the default) and METHOD="POST" is primarily defined in terms of form data encoding. The official recommendations say that "GET" should be used if and only if the form processing is idempotent, which typically means a pure query form. Generally it is advisable to do so. There are, however, problems related to long URLs and non-ASCII character repertoires which can make it necessary to use "POST" even for idempotent processing.

The most effective way to determine correct monitor height is to sit correctly in your chair or where ever you view your monitor. Next, close your eyes and position your body and head in a neutral and comfortable position - your spine should be straight and head centered over your shoulders. Then, open your eyes and note at which point your eyes are initially focused on. This area should correlate to the center of your monitors screen or the part of the screen you view most frequently...

9 (?content_id=959) ) Spiritualist Basics (http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/5927/sbaseNF.htm) : There is a quality of the universe called vibration. Every thing and every one vibrates. Vibration can be thought of as being on a scale from low (and slow) to high (and fast). Your vibration is low when you are depressed because you have lost your job or have turmoil in your family. You walk into a room where two people have just had a violent argument and you can "cut the tension with a knife" the vibration is low also. When you get up in the morning, it's a beautiful day and you have that feeling that "everything is perfect" or you are feeling love for someone, the vibration is high.

Workers at Farrelly Facilities and Engineering begin and end the day with an embrace. It's produced a happier workforce. Since they started this routine, at the end of 1999, profits at the heating and air conditioning business have more than doubled. One of the directors, John Farrelly, told BBC News Online that none of the 50 workers was forced to cuddle.

16 (?content_id=915) ) Dawn of a new database (http://ww1.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/fixup.pl?story=http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/03/18/020318opwireless.xml&dctag=businessnews) : Oracle makes an OK database. Microsoft's SQL Server and IBM's DB2 aren't bad either. But as data gets collected over wireless and the demand for a warp-speed response increases, all of these well- established - dare I say, old-time - companies may soon get a rude awakening. You see, transactional databases are coming into their own. Think about it. In the old days, only employees had access to a company database, typically used to collect and analyze data and issue reports. Now, anybody with a cell phone can access a database, and it must respond to not hundreds but hundreds of thousands of users, says Paul Grabscheid, VP of strategic planning at InterSystems.

17 (?content_id=914) ) Lenasia's Black Hindu Priest Breaks Myths (http://www.newsindia-times.com/2002/03/29/intl-sa.html) : He used to be a devout Christian until curiosity took him to a Hindu temple in Lenasia town, 25 miles south of this South African city. Four years later, Meshack Jantjies, 35, is South Africa's first black African Hindu priest. Not only does the deputy resident priest at the Siva Gnana Sabay temple have a large following, but with tremendous effort he is also mastering the Tamil language. Initially, Jantjies joined activities at the temple while working as a cleaner there. When his family joined him to live on the premises, he found more time to engage in deeper studies. "The resident priest then made me a tape which I listened to over and over. I learned to recite prayers from the "Thevaram" (collections of Tamil devotion songs) by doing that. I also joined the adult Tamil classes at the temple." Two years ago, Jantjies was appointed the deputy resident priest. He has been fully accepted by the devotees. "When I stand before the people here and lead the prayers, I feel that I am with my own family," said Jantjies. He goes to great pains to emphasize that he was not recruited or converted by anyone. "I was like a wild animal before joining the temple, and now I have found peace with myself. Jantjies now plans to make it his mission to break prevailing myths among other communities about worship at Hindu temples.

Throughout the rise of the New Economy bubble in late 1999 and 2000, CEO Hasso Plattner had to battle charges that SAP was a dinosaur left behind in the explosive growth of the Internet. The company, which Plattner created with four colleagues from IBM, had made its name with big corporate planning systems that were a byword for technical excellence and user unfriendliness, requiring armies of consultants and months of preparation to make them work.

In the complex world of ERP II, enterprises with large-scale implementations are likely to experience difficulties that expose flaws in vendors' support and quality assurance processes. Therefore, enterprises should become more proactive with respect to their system support and management. The critical support and escalation issues illustrated by the Oracle DBMS bug will have major ramifications on the credibility of the ERP II Unix market to support large-scale business operations.

"There will still be a role for packaged applications behind the firewall," says Meyer, "but the complexity of these systems makes it impossible to build exhaustive integration across applications. The SAP mindset is that "we own this world so you can't touch this," which is why [the move into application development] will be massively unsuccessful."

24 (?content_id=875) ) Carnatic music should reach masses (http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/12/21/stories/2001122102060500.htm) : CHENNAI, INDIA, December 20, 2001: Carnatic music in its pristine form should reach the masses, Mr. M. Karpagavinayagam, judge, Madras High Court told The Hindu newspaper. Lighting the traditional lamp to mark the inaugural of the Rasika Ranjani Sabha's annual music festival 2001- 2002, he said flawless music gained prominence only when it reached the common man. He called upon music organizations to motivate and draw the younger generation into their fold by propagating the joy of carnatic music. Mr. A. R. Santhanakrishnan, sabha president, said efforts were on to revive the sabha's sastriya sangeetha school of music. The auditorium renovation would be carried out with the assistance of sponsors, rasikas, and well wishers.

Many, the NetValue analysis says, seem do a sizeable amount of online shopping and banking during their working hours. The October figures from the Internet research firm, which have just been expanded to cover work and university Internet access, show that 7.8 million Brits - 25% of the workforce - now access the Net from their place of employment. The problem, the research firm says, is that many also access the Net during their normal working hours - i.e., when they should be working.

30 (?content_id=863) ) The Wellsprings of Horror in the Cradle (http://www.nospank.org/miller17.htm) : Alice Miller, a 1986 recipient of the Janusz Korczak Literary Award by the Anti-Defamation League, has sought to find answers to the tragedy of terrorism and the people who perpetrate it. She believes, "On the basis of the research I have done into the childhood histories of the most ruthless dictators, like Hitler, Stalin, Mao or Ceaucescu, terrorism in general and the recent horrifying attacks on the United States are a macabre but precise demonstration of what happens to millions and millions of children the world over in the name of good parenting." She adds that "nobody comes to the world with the wish to destroy. Every newborn, independently from the culture, religion or ethnic origins needs to love, be loved, protected, and respected. This is his biological design. If he is maltreated by the cruel upbringing he will develop the very strong wish to take revenge. He will be driven to destroy others or himself but only by his history and never by inborn genes. The suppression and subsequent denial of early rage that often ends up in hatred with an endless number of ideologies." Miller resides in Switzerland and hosts a website www.alice-miller.com where her readers can share their experiences with others.

33 (?content_id=860) ) Magician Loses Its Sparkling Touch (http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT34XVQOETC&live=true&query=SAP) : SAP, Europe's largest software maker, had been doing so well this year that it was starting to look more like the work of black magic than skilful management. That, at least, was the impression until recently when it became the last sizeable player in its devastated sector to issue a profit warning. No longer under the spell, analysts are now wondering whether the warning was a blip or the prelude to more serious problems for the German group. At the very least, they say, the episode has pointed to serious weaknesses that must be addressed quickly. One of them lies in SAP's handling of its last results announcement, which not only irritated investors but also fanned fears the group may have lost "visibility" on developments in its market...As Mr Ashton puts it: "You can have the biggest firework in the world, it is no good if you do not have the audience."

Hasso Plattner, SAP chief executive, will announce next week that the German group is to adopt Sun's J2EE architecture, a development platform for enterprise software based on the Java programming language, to run SAP software. SAP's move is likely to be a blow to Microsoft, as the German group has one of the largest customer bases of any business software developer.

Honored as an international leader in her promotion of organic farming, she flew from her home in Doon Valley, India, on a flight after the terrorist attacks. With courage and fortitude, she has advocated organic methods of farming as the core and essence of a peaceful society. When plants are able to grow by natural means in rich soil untouched by the violence of chemicals, the result is peaceful farmers and families. Dr. Vandana herself has seen the results of chemically ravaged land farmed by huge corporations in the Punjab. Local farmers, unable to make a living for their families, have lost their dignity and respect. After praising the MOFGA for their work in endorsing organic farming, Dr. Vandana drew parallels in this area with her own organic farm in the foothills of the Himalayas
