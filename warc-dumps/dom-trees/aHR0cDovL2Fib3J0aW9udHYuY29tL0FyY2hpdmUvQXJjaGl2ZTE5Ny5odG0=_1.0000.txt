    TV,&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I am a 
    23 yr old proud mother of one beautiful babygirl Ariana and I am 3 months 
    pregnant with my 2nd blessing due in august of 2005.&nbsp; Never would I have 
    imagined I would be a mother of two wonderful children before i turned 25 
    yrs old.&nbsp; Needless to say I wouldnt have it any other way now.&nbsp; I am 
    completely convinced through no outside influence, that I was meant to be a 
    mother of these children.&nbsp; I mean if God knew we couldnt handle it - he 
    wouldnt have put us in certain situations.&nbsp; I cannot stand when i see a 
    female of whatever age go be promiscious or even have sex with that one 
    person although they know in their hearts to do differently - then have the 
    balls to say they arent ready to be a parent and they need to have a n 
    abortion.&nbsp; Who gave them the right to play God? To me it is complete 
    stupidity that they will go and open their legs to whomever so asks them to 
    and then result to abortion as a quick fix.&nbsp; Believe you me - where im from 
    abortion seems to be in style.&nbsp; I have as a matter of fact stopped talking 
    to one "IDIOT" who had about 4 abortions and probably has V.I.P status at 
    the local clinic.&nbsp; I think abortion totally demeans what we stand for as a 
    united nation.&nbsp; These poor children are meant to be in this world.&nbsp; They 
    have a meaning and a purpose.&nbsp; If not, they wouldve never been conceived.&nbsp; I 
    just cant understand as a Human with a heart how someone could do this to a 
    life which is growing inside of them.&nbsp; Why not just be happy and blessed and 
    content, There really isnt that much more happiness in this world other than 
    knowing that you carried around the next generation of this beautiful 
    country right in your own belly.&nbsp; Your own flesh and blood growing and 
    smiling at you daily.&nbsp; Your own breath falling asleep in your arms after a 
    nice warm baba.&nbsp; If i was a millionaire my only set purpose would be to 
    rescue these "unwanted" babies from their devilish mothers and fathers.&nbsp; But 
    I'm not - so the only thing there is left to do is hope that they read these 
    cries from someone who hurts and feels for these babies with no voices and 
    no say so in anything.&nbsp; PLease for the sake of yourselves and the life you 
    are carrying inside of you - do not go through with it.&nbsp; Whatever is dealt 
    in your path you will find a way to surpass it all.&nbsp; As women we are strong 
    - so stop killing what you are meant to bring into this world.&nbsp; PLease stop 
    Murdering these beautiful babies.</span></p>

    name is christina and im 16 years old 17 in april and about 2 weeks before 
    christmas i found out i was pregnant. ive been with my boyfriend who is soon 
    to be 19 for 2 years and at first we were upset over the pregnancy but we've 
    been together almost 2 years and this is the first time that ive gotten 
    pregnant and to me this baby is suppose to be here for a reason if god gave 
    it to me after 2 years of us being together.&nbsp; my parents found out i was 
    pregnant and immediately made the decision for me that i should have an 
    abortion.&nbsp; i've been fighting it trying to keep my baby. ive called clinics 
    and hotlines asking about if i can be forced to have the abortion and they 
    all gave me the same answer that its my body and i cant be forced to do 
    anything i dont want to do.&nbsp; my boyfriend and his parents have been very 
    supportive helping me go to dr. appointments and everything.&nbsp; but ive been 
    doing it all alone without anyone in my family.&nbsp; i dont know what will 
    happen but i pray to god everyday that i will keep my baby and have a safe 
    pregnancy and i want to thank all the amazing women who have written to this 
    site because you gave me a perspective on my babys life and you are helping 
    me not give up &nbsp;</span></p>

    name is Kim and I'm with AbortionTv.&nbsp; The clinics are right.&nbsp; It's your body 
    your choice, HOWEVER, there are always women walking into those clinics 
    yelling that they "do not" want to abort, yet there parents/boyfriend are 
    making them, and no matter how many times they tell the doctor "no", the 
    doctor still sadates (sp?) them and continues with the abortion.&nbsp; What 
    happened to "My Body My Choice"? Abortion is nothing but a big fat "lie".</span></p>

    when your own family does not understand the action you are taking - I know 
    it well but...&nbsp; I also know that if you choose to do what they choose for 
    you, there will be regret forever.&nbsp; Am hoping your family will wake up to 
    the wonder of this child within but, in the meantime, please remember that 
    friends are the family we choose for ourselves.&nbsp; That has made a huge 
    difference in my own daughter's life! :):):)&nbsp; </span></p>

    1/23/04&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I just 
    wanted to let other young women know that abortion is never easy to deal 
    with. I am a 29 year old mother of 4.&nbsp; I had my first daughter 4 days after 
    I turned 16. I thought long and hard about abortion when I first found out I 
    was pregnant for her. My boyfriend (her father) had dumped me right before I 
    found out I was pregnant and when I told him he told me it wasn't his. The 
    thing that finally made me decide to keep my baby was a poem that a friend 
    of mine had found and given me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But to 
    go on after my youngest daughter was born (she will be 3 this month) I found 
    out I had to have surgery to remove cancerous cells. The problem was worse 
    than the doctor thought and he had to remove more of my cervix ect... than 
    he thought.&nbsp; The doctor told me I would most likely never be able to carry 
    another baby to term, and that a pregnancy would cause severe complications 
    for me also.&nbsp; Well protection is never fool proof and I got pregnant, I was 
    scared.....so scared.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">My 
    doctor recommended an abortion but I didnt know how far along I was and he 
    couldn't get me in for an ultra sound for over 3 weeks. My boyfriend and I 
    talked it over, we decided that if we had to have an abortion we needed to 
    do it right away before our baby grew any bigger. Because we both firmly 
    believe that it is not just a fetus it's a baby right from the start. So we 
    went to an abortion clinic and talked to the so called counselors and cried 
    and cried. I was just under 6 weeks along. I was heartbroken but the thought 
    of leaving my other 4 children without a mother was also heartbreaking. I 
    told them to do it right then. They offered me demoral and valium but there 
    was nothing they could offer my baby to help him or her with what was about 
    to happen so I refused it. I remember laying there and staring at the 
    ceiling while I cried.....not for the pain but for my baby....my precious 
    baby.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Since 
    that day in November of 2003 I have never spoken of it again. But I think of 
    my baby all the time.&nbsp; I wonder if my baby was a boy or girl. I wonder now 
    what would have happened if I had taken the chance of having my baby. No 
    matter what your reason is for having and abortion, it's never easy....theres 
    always the ache in your heart the yearning to have had a chance to hold your 
    baby. I am still strongly against abortion unless there are life and death 
    medical reasons but even then It was the hardest thing in the world I have 
    ever done. So please if your thinking of having an abortion for any reason 
    at all, think about it really hard because that is your baby. The day a baby 
    is born and the mother holds him for the first time is the most wonderful 
    feeling in the world it is beyond words. I love my boyfriend, my parents, my 
    family and friends but nothing compares to the way I love my children. There 
    is no greater love.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Unfortunately, your health care provider was not only misinformed regarding 
    your condition, but wrong as well.&nbsp; There are medical procedures today which 
    allow women in your position to carry their babies to term.&nbsp; One is a 
    pessary ring which prevents cervical collapse, the second is to literally 
    stitch the cervix closed during the pregnancy.&nbsp; Both methods have used to 
    prevent premature birth and allow the fetus to develop safely.&nbsp; Please 
    investigate these possibilities should you become pregnant again.&nbsp; You might 
    want to seek a second opinion, too. </span></p>

    can take care of the responsibilities afterwards.&nbsp; At least put it up for 
    adoption.&nbsp; I've always heard the expression Life isn't Fair and now I

    Moms had their own dorms with their own set of rules. We also had a day 
    -care (free of charge) that was run by our Education department. What a 
    great concept! Ed students had on site training and single moms could attend 
    class. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue">This program was

    of the moms that I graduated with. I have not made a donation since 
    graduating six years ago. Now every month I send $10 specifically for this 
    program. Is it alot? No..$100 a year is peanuts but I felt it was the most 
    important program I should donate to. &nbsp;</span></p>
