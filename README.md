# 1) Research Plan

Can be taken from the project expos√© (/documentation/expose.pdf). Deviations will be documented.

# 2) Definition of a "Statement about the Future"

## Definition of a Statement

"Statements are sentences that express a fact, idea or opinion. Statements do not ask questions, make requests or give
commands. They are also not exclamations.

Statement sentences can be simple, compound or complex sentences; a sentence always consists of at least one clause
containing a subject and a verb and nearly always ends in a full stop." \

## When do we classify a Statement as "about the Future"?

A sentence must match the previous described definition of a statement. Furthermore it must be related to the future,
e.g. what will happen at some point in the future.

An example statement from the candidate dataset created from our regex pre-filtering that wouldn't be classified as "about the Future" is:
"USGPRU officials said this was the first fatality in the series in nine years.".
This sentence refers to a period of time in the past.

# 3) Data used for the future statements extraction model

``data/candidates_labeled.pkl`` contains 88 Statements about the Future and 112 sentences that don't match the
requirements described in 2). \
``data/candidates_unlabeled.pkl`` contains 7590 unlabeled candidate sentences.

# 4) How to use the web-archive-pipeline

## create config.ini

```
[s3]
BUCKET_NAMES = ["corpus-iwo-internet-archive-wide00001"]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = ***REMOVED***
AWS_SECRET = ***REMOVED***
ENDPOINT_URL = http://s3.dw.webis.de:7480/

[pyspark]
SPARK_INSTANCES = 5
enable_prebuilt_dependencies = yes

[tensorflow]
BATCHSIZE = 20

[profiler]
enable_logging = no
logging_delay_s = 120
logging_duration_s = 60
```

## execute python scripts

```
HADOOP_USER_NAME=$USER 
srun --export=ALL --pty --mem=50g --container-name=web-archive-keras \
--container-image=ghcr.io#niklasdeckers/web-archive-keras:master \
