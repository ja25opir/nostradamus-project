    Image Making A Comeback At CES</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">CRN.com ChannelWeb, by Andrew R Hickey</font><br>
    </p><p>Sharper Image, the struggling consumer electronics retailer that met its 
    demise after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February (2008), 
    is planning a comeback at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas 
    next month.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
    In an e-mail sent to CES attendees on Friday, Sharper Image said it will 
    launch more than 20 new products that will be available in a "wide range of 
    retail stores in 2009." <br>
    <br>
    "Please join us for the much-anticipated launch of the 'New Era of Sharper 
    Image,'" the e-mail stated. <br>
    <br>
    "Our all new electronics line brings back to the marketplace the best things 
    that the Sharper Image brand represents - innovation, premium performance 
    and unique designs," the e-mail continued. "We'll be relaunching with a 
    range of wireless audio, bedside audio, portable audio and speaker systems 
    products. " <br>
    <br>
    Earlier this year, San Francisco-based Sharper Image filed for bankruptcy 
    after experiencing declining sales since 2004. The company recorded net 
    losses in fiscal 2005 to 2007, which continued into 2008. Dwindling consumer 
    spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers 
    were integral to the bankruptcy filing. <br>
    <br>
    At its peak, Sharper Image had 186 stores nationwide, while also selling 
    through a monthly catalog and a Web site. As of June 1, 2008 96 Sharper 
    Image stores had completed liquidation and were closed. The remaining stores 
    and assets were bought out by Hilco Merchant Resources and Gordon Brothers 
    Group. Since then, all remaining stores have been shuttered.<br>
    <br>
    On Friday, hinting at its pending attempt at a comeback, Sharper Image's Web 
    site simply read: "Sorry to keep you in the dark. But, there's something big 
    coming. Soon. Stay tuned."<br>

    Disinfecting Marine Vessel Ballast Water With UV</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">EnvironmentalExpert.com</font><br>
    </p><p>To assist operators of cruise ships, tankers, semi-submersibles, jack-up 
    rigs and other large ocean-going vessels to meet the International Maritime 
    Organisation’s (IMO’s) impending ballast water discharge requirements, UV 
    disinfection specialist Hanovia has partnered with three of the world’s 
    leading systems integrators to provide validated, on-board water treatment 
    systems that are easy to install and use.<br>
    <br>
    All ocean-going vessels take on water to provide ballast and stability. It 
    is usually taken on in coastal port areas and transported to the next port 
    of call – sometimes on the other side of the world – where it may be 
    discharged. Much of this water contains marine microorganisms such as 
    zooplankton, algae, bacteria and the eggs, cysts and larvae of various 
    species. While many die in transit, some survive and invade the local marine 
    environment, out-competing native species and causing serious damage to 
    native ecosystems. Environmental damage caused by ballast water is now 
    regarded as one of the greatest threats to the world’s oceans.<br>
    <br>
    Two methods have been proposed to combat this problem: onboard ballast water 
    treatment and ballast water exchange. As the name suggests, ballast water 
    treatment involves treatment of ballast water prior to discharge, while 
    ballast water exchange involves ballasting and de-ballasting in the open 
    ocean before coming into ports and coastal waters. This open ocean exchange 
    is not an ideal solution as it is potentially unsafe and can destabilise the 
    vessel. Also, because existing ballast water exchange systems do not 
    completely drain the tanks, sediment and a residual amount of water can 
    remain, leaving behind non-indigenous species which could be discharged in 
    port later.<br>
    <br>
    As well as being unsafe, open ocean ballast water exchange is difficult to 
    regulate and monitor, so many operators simply do not do it. Because of this 
    the IMO is setting much tougher standards to control ballast water practices 
    and has published two Conventions to tackle the problem. The first is the 
    International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), 
    dealing with waste and sewage discharge from ships (ratified in 2003), and 
    the second is the Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention, to control the 
    spread of alien species (due for ratification in 2009). Under the BWM 
    Convention, vessels will have to treat all ballast water so that discharges 
    contain less than 10 viable organisms per cubic metre equal to or greater in 
    size than 50 µm in size. <br>
    <br>
    To help operators confront these requirements Hanovia, in tandem with the 
    leading systems integrators, has devised a UV disinfection system that, in 
    conjunction with a filter, kills or removes virtually all microorganisms 
    present in ballast water. The combined system comprises a high intensity, 
    medium pressure UV disinfection unit and an automatic back-flush filter. 
    After passing through the filter to remove larger organisms, the ballast 
    water flows into the UV chamber to destroy smaller organisms. During 
    de-ballasting, the water bypasses the filter but again flows through the UV 
    chamber where further irradiation kills any remaining microorganisms.<br>
    <br>
    The entire system has a very small footprint and can be mounted at any 
    angle, making it easy to install even in the confined spaces of a vessel’s 
    equipment room. Once installed, the system requires little effort to operate 
    by the crew. It can be controlled by a master PLC unit which can be 
    integrated into the vessel’s machinery automation network. The UV unit is 
    equipped with automatic wipers to keep the UV lamps clean, and the only 
    maintenance required by the crew is the replacement of the UV lamps once a 
    year and occasional preventative maintenance procedures.<br>

    Crystal IS, Inc. Wins $800,000 Department of Defense Grant to Develop UV-LEDs</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Finchannel.com</font><br>
    </p><p>Crystal IS, Inc., the world's leading manufacturer of ultraviolet light 
    emitting diodes (UV LEDs) based on aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate 
    technology, today announced it will receive an $800,000 appropriation from 
    the U.S. Department of Defense to advance development of large AlN crystals 
    for effective deep ultraviolet sources.<br>
    <br>
    "Our unique technology allows us to manufacture UV LEDs with unsurpassed 
    performance at truly commercially viable costs," said Crystal IS CEO Steven 
    Berger. "This grant serves as yet another validation of using AlN-based UV-LEDs 
    to enable cleaner water and air for consumer, industrial and government 
    customers."<br>
    <br>
    As part of the program, Crystal IS will partner with the Army Research 
    Laboratory in Adelphi, MD as well as the Electro-Optics Center (EOC) at Penn 
    State University. The program will leverage the recent development of large 
    single-crystal AlN substrates into robust semiconductor sources of deep 
    ultraviolet light as well as other high power, high temperature applications 
    of great importance to the military.<br>
    <br>
    AlN has been demonstrated to be superior for deep UV light-emitting 
    applications. The primary applications of UV-LEDs are as long-lasting, 
    energy efficient, water and air disinfection devices. Crystal IS Inc is 
    developing its deep UV-LEDs at 265nm, the peak germicidal wavelength.<br>

    LUKOIL Upgrades Environmental Complex At Perm Refinery</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Finchannel.com</font><br>
    </p><p>Vagit Alekperov, President of OAO LUKOIL, and Grigory Rapota, 
    Plenipotentiary of the RF President in the Volga Federal District, 
    participated in the festive ceremony held in Perm on October 31 to honor the 
    50th anniversary of OOO “LUKOIL-Permnefteorgsintez”. <br>
    <br>
    As part of the ceremony held at the refinery, newly constructed and 
    renovated facilities of the environmental complex, which incorporates 
    facilities for mechanical, chemical and biochemical treatment, mechanical 
    and sorption filters, ultraviolet disinfection units and a surplus sludge 
    dehydration unit, were presented. <br>
    <br>
    According to LUKOIL , the complex is designed for deep purificaiton of the 
    industrial sewage generated by “LUKOIL-Permnefteorgsintez” and dozens of 
    other plants and enterprises which form the Osentsovsk industrial hub 
    located in Perm. The complex capacity is 68 thousand cu.m. of purified 
    industrial sewage per day. <br>
    <br>
    Cutting-edge technologies and equipment allow to remove hydrocarbons, 
    nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing pollutants, thus making the quality of 
    the purified industrial sewage compliant with fishery requirements. 
    Application of filters with coal sorbents prevents discharge of over 40 tons 
    of petroleum products per annum into surface water bodies. Application of 
    the ultraviolet disinfection method instead of classic chemical treating 
    methods to purify the sewage from pathogenic microorganisms is a 
    characteristic feature of the complex. Application of new technologies for 
    industrial sewage purification also allows to cut river water consumption of 
    the enterprise by 10 %. <br>
    <br>
    Since 2006, over RUR 500 million has been invested into construction of new 
    facilities and reconstruction of the existing ones at OOO 
    “LUKOIL-Permnefteorgsintez” environmental complex.<br>

    Municipality adding UV disinfection facility</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">PiqueNewsMagazine.com /by Claire Piech</font><br>
    </p><p>Construction on an ultra violet (UV) disinfection facility is expected to 
    begin this fall, as part of the municipality’s $12 million upgrades to 
    Whistler’s 21 Mile Creek water system.<br>
    <br>
    Council is expected to award the construction contract within the next 
    month, and the Resort Municipality of Whistler has budgeted $1.7 million for 
    the UV system, which has been on the books since 2006, according to capital 
    projects manager John Nelson.<br>
    <br>
    “We still chlorinate both our surface source and our ground water source, 
    but the UV is just an added level of treatment that is necessary on surface 
    sources,” Nelson explained.<br>
    <br>
    The 900 square foot UV facility will be built next to the Whistler cemetery 
    and will be accessed via the cemetery’s road off Alta Lake Road.<br>
    <br>
    Residents can expect some disruption while construction of the facility and 
    road repaving are underway, but the cemetery will be open for internment 
    services and visitors, said an RMOW press release.<br>
    <br>
    The municipality will also make sure burial area boundaries and the 
    scattering garden are both marked and protected throughout the construction 
    period. And contractors will stop building during any burial services.<br>
    <br>
    Currently, the 21 Mile Creek water is disinfected by chlorination and piped 
    to the village under Alta Lake.<br>
    <br>
    The UV disinfection facility is part of four upgrades to Whistler’s 21 Mile 
    Creek water system, which provides about 75 per cent of the town’s water 
    supply. The upgrades are intended to improve the safety and capacity of the 
    municipality’s water system, said RMOW staff.<br>
    <br>
    The municipality is tapping into a new groundwater source at Rainbow Park 
    that will connect to the village’s water grid through a pipeline along 
    Lorimer Road. Both the pipeline installation and the pump station 
    construction are underway. Each is expected to cost $5.2 million, said 
    Nelson.<br>
    <br>
    An upgrade to the 21 Mile Aquifer Wells is also scheduled to take place 
    between 2010 and 2012. <br>
    <br>
    Both the Alpine Meadows and Emerald Estates neighbourhoods have their own 
    water systems, and the Benchlands is serviced by the Blackcomb system, which 
    is connected to the main system.<br>
    <br>
    The RMOW is also looking to develop a new groundwater source at Function 
    Junction to supply the athletes’ village.<br>
    <br>
    Whistler’s water is continually checked by the municipality, which spends 
    $1.19 million per year on water operations. The sampling and testing program 
    involves 33 different sample points where the water is tested for 
    bacteriological contamination like E. coli and coliform.<br>
    <br>
    In 2007, E. coli and coliform tests showed there were no bacteria in the 
    water.<br>

    Larne sewage works leads the way with UV technology</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">LarneTimes.co.uk</font><br>
    </p><p>REGIONAL Development Minister Conor Murphy officially opened Larne's new 
    £14m wastewater treatment works last Wednesday.<br>
    <br>
    The plant is the first to use ultra violet light technology - new 
    eco-friendly technology which removes bacteria from the treatment process 
    without the use of chemical disinfectants, leading to improvements in water 
    quality in the area.<br>
    <br>
    The new NI Water site caters for a population of 33,000, and will provide a 
    state of the art facility ensuring the level of treatment meets European 
    standards.<br>
    <br>
    Mr Murphy said: "This investment will ensure that this facility supports the 
    growth and ongoing development within the area, while protecting the local 
    environment. Protection of the lough's eco-system is particularly important 
    in this designated Area of Special Scientific Interest. The use of this 
    technology will ensure that NI Water is doing all it can to safeguard the 
    wetland environment, the shellfish and the bird wildlife.<br>
    <br>
    "Investment of approximately £1million per day is taking place in upgrading 
    the water and sewerage system infrastructure. This facility is just one 
    example of the scale of investment required to provide cleaner beaches and 
    rivers, meet European standards, respond to increasing demand and provide 
    the region with a modern service."<br>
    <br>
    Chris Mellor, Chairman and Chief Executive of NI Water added: "NI Water is 
    committed to investing in projects that will deliver the best innovative 
    solutions and benefit the local economy, community and environment. 
    Extensive research was conducted into sourcing environmentally friendly 
    technology with a proven track record that could meet the standards set by 
    the Northern Ireland Environment Agency for this area.<br>
    <br>
    "Using UV technology is better for the environment as there are less 
    chemicals used in the treatment processes and it also allows an increase in 
    the capacity of water which can be treated, reducing the likelihood of 
    flooding in the area.<br>
    <br>
    "I would like to pay tribute to the expertise of the team involved in this 
    scheme and congratulate our project managers and contractors on achieving 
    our compliance standard on schedule."<br>

    Jennings said the water will be provided by the Leisure Time Bottled Water 
    Co. in Monticello and will go to 34 families. The Ulster County Health 
    Department has taken water samples from the Route 209/Smith Road area and 
    discovered high levels of E. coli, especially in dug wells. Jennings said 
    he, in turn, negotiated an agreement with New York City DEP Regional Manager 
    Ira Stern for the city to reimburse the town for the cost of the bottled 
    water until <b>ultraviolet treatment systems</b> can be installed in each

    Germicidal UVC Lights Improve Clinical Pregnancy Rates For IVF Lab, New 
    Study Finds</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">MedicalNewsToday.com</font><br>
    </p><p>A seven and a half-year study conducted in the In Vitro Fertilization 
    Cleanroom Laboratory of the Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network found 
    that the use of ultraviolet C or "UVC" lights installed in the HVAC system 
    had a clinically significant impact on clinical pregnancy rates (CPR). In 
    presenting the findings at the annual meeting of the American Society for 
    Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), Kathryn C. Worrilow, Ph.D. reported that the + 
    beta and CPR increased by an average of 17.8% and 18.2%, respectively, 
    following 10 of the 13 change-outs of the Steril-Aire UVC EmittersT over the 
    test period.<br>
    <br>
    Clinical success in an IVF lab is critically dependent upon the quality of 
    the ambient air, which in turn, is directly dependent upon the HVAC system. 
    The study led by Dr. Worrilow tracked three key components in the HVAC 
    system - particulate filters, gas phase filters and UVC lights - and the 
    timing of their replacement - to determine whether these individual 
    components affected markers of preimplantation embryogenesis and clinical 
    pregnancy rates.<br>
    <br>
    According to the findings, "There were no statistically significant 
    differences associated with the replacement of the particulate or gas phase 
    filters in Testing Quarters 1-48. In contrast, immediately following 10 of 
    the 13 UVC Emitter change-outs, the + beta hCG and clinical pregnancy rates 
    increased 17.8% and 18.2%, respectively."<br>
    <br>
    The study goes on to say: "UVC energy will destroy 90 - 99% of airborne 
    microbial contaminants. By targeting the DNA and RNA of microorganisms, UVC 
    degrades and abates the proliferation of airborne and surface embryotoxic 
    organics. Of equal significance to the developing embryo is the suggested 
    impact of UVC irradiation on the degradation of VOCs. Our work has 
    demonstrated that VOC levels as low as 2.2 ppb can be embryotoxic to the 
    embryo cultured in vitro."<br>
    <br>
    The authors conclude: "Although the use of UVC light represents a departure 
    from the standard HVAC design used in many IVF laboratories, the current 
    study suggests that the use of UVC germicidal technology in the HVAC system 
    serving the IVF laboratory may play a critical role in providing optimal 
    ambient air towards improved clinical outcomes. The current study 
    demonstrated that a clinically significant relationship existed between the 
    replacement of the UVC Emitters and the associated clinical pregnancy 
    rates."<br>
    <br>
    Robert Scheir, Ph.D., president of Steril-Aire, Inc., states: "This new data 
    provides scientific evidence of the germicidal benefits of UVC technology. 
    The potential benefits are far-reaching: not only for the potential to 
    improve CPR in IVF clinics, but also for enhancing infection control in 
    hospitals and healthcare environments, and for maintaining better ambient 
    air in medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing clean rooms."<br>
    <br>
    Scheir adds: "The study also confirms the importance of adequate UVC output 
    and changeout frequency in achieving desired results. The study used 
    high-output Steril-Aire UVC lamps with a changeout schedule of 6-9 months. 
    In the 3 of 13 UVC replacement test quarters that did not result in improved 
    clinical pregnancy rates, outside factors may have played a role in the 
    outcomes. As long as the lamps were functioning properly and were changed on 
    schedule, results were consistently positive. The message to anyone using 
    UVC is that it is critical to select a device with adequate output and to 
    replace the device consistently at required intervals to maintain that 
    output. Otherwise, germicidal effectiveness will be diminished."<br>

    for Emerging Ballast Water Treatment Systems</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">WCPonline.com, by Jon McClean</font><br>
    </p><p>High-power, compact UV systems are now being used to prevent the transit 
    across the globe of a wide variety of organisms in ships’ ballast water. 
    Ballast water is taken on board in ports of call to maintain stability when 
    the vessel is not laden and discharged as the vessel becomes laden with 
    cargo.<br>
    <br>
    This small system discharge is often released thousands of miles from the 
    port of embarkation and relocates microscopic plants, mussels, crabs and 
    recently, the fish pathogen viral hemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS)1 far from 
    their native range.<br>
    <br>
    UV systems are being incorporated in packages that use separation technology 
    to prepare the ballast water to be disinfected using UV light prior to 
    discharge. The UV systems are compact, use high power polychromatic lamps, 
    have automatic wiping mechanisms and are generally configured with lamps at 
    right angles to the flow. This orientation saves space and eliminates bends, 
    which are detrimental to flow profiles before and after the UV chambers.<br>
    <br>
    Medium-pressure lamps are most often used in this application, as their 
    compact size permits a small treatment footprint, allowing skid mounting and 
    safe lamp removal.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The problem</b><br>
    More than 46,0002 commercial vessels—tankers, cruise liners, bulk carriers, 
    RO/RO ferries, container ships and barges— travel across the oceans carrying 
    cargo and passengers for transport, leisure and commerce. Between three to 
    four billion metric tons of ballast water move across the oceans annually.<br>
    <br>
    Approximately 75 percent of these vessels are involved in intercontinental 
    trade. The asymmetric nature of this trade means that occasionally container 
    vessels arrive laden into US ports from China and embark empty, ballasted 
    with water taken on board in the US.<br>
    <br>
    Likewise, coal and iron ore carriers arrive empty into Australian or South 
    American ports fully ballasted with water. And they discharge this ballast 
    water prior to taking cargo on board. Ballast water is also often used as a 
    trim aid in port when loading or unloading cargo.<br>
    <br>
    It is estimated that 7,000 species are transported in ships ballast water. 
    The majority of these species do not survive the ballasting/de-ballasting 
    cycle, as the environment within the ballast tanks is hostile and not 
    conducive to permit colonies of organisms to survive. Those that do survive, 
    however, are usually hardy. And they frequently out-compete indigenous 
    species, surviving to establish a reproducing population.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Invasive threat</b><br>
    Over 100 non-native species of marine organisms are known to have been 
    introduced globally by ballast water. While some appear benign, others are a 
    threat to biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture.<br>
    <br>
    The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) views the 
    threat of invasion by these species as “the greatest immediate threat to 
    most coastal state ecosystems.” Some introduced species severely deplete 
    native populations or deprive them of food. Others form colonies that can 
    damage<br>
    other existing fauna.<br>
    <br>
    Introduced toxic dinoflagellates cause red tides and algal blooms that can 
    affect or even kill shellfish, fish and sea birds. When eaten by humans, 
    these contaminated shellfish can cause paralysis or even fatality. In 
    southern Australia and along the west coast of the US, the Asian kelp 
    Undaria pinnatifida is rapidly<br>
    invading new areas, displacing the native seabed communities. Shipments of 
    the European oyster Ostrea edulis were brought from Washington to France to 
    supplement a low native stock. The virus Bonamia ostrea accompanied these 
    shipments and ended up destroying the remaining native stock of the European 
    oyster in France.<br>
    <br>
    In the Black Sea, filter-feeding North American jellyfish (Mnemiopsis leidyi) 
    have on occasion reached densities of two lbs of biomass per nine cubic ft. 
    This culprit has depleted native zooplankton stocks to such an extent that 
    it contributed to the collapse of entire Black Sea commercial fisheries in 
    the 1990’s.<br>
    Salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) once used as packing material 
    for Atlantic oysters (Crassostrea virginica), has been introduced into 
    Oregon. The cordgrass continues to spread along the Oregon coast, taking 
    over mudflats and disrupting bird migrations. The fish pathogen VHS was 
    reported in the Great Lakes<br>
    area in 20036. The rapid transfer of the virus through all of the waterways 
    frequented by vessels dumping ballast is no coincidence.<br>
    <br>
    The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) was banned for importation and 
    aquaculture in the US in the late 1980s; however, the crab was discovered in 
    San Francisco Bay in 1994. Introduction by ballast water is the probable 
    source. The crab burrows into riverbanks, dykes and levees causing erosion 
    and siltation.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The solution</b><br>
    The United Nations’ International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a number 
    of initiatives underway at this time to address the issue of non-indigenous 
    species transit and invasion and to address pollution of the ocean and fresh 
    water areas. The Ballast Water Management (BWM) convention was published in 
    2004 and has a target implementation date of 2009. MARPOL 73/78 
    (International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships) covers the 
    discharge of sewage at sea and came into force in 2003.<br>
    <br>
    Two methods are proposed to mitigate the threat of species transfer: either 
    ballast water treatment (BWT) or ballast water exchange (BWE). BWE is 
    available only to those non-coastal vessels that can exchange ballast water 
    mid-ocean. This is a time-consuming and potentially hazardous exercise, as 
    it involves the vessel stopping or slowing considerably and exposes hull 
    structures to stress. A number of ship designers are now developing ‘no 
    stop’ BWE systems or vessel designs that eliminate the need for ballast 
    water altogether. For BWE regimes, a 95 percent volumetric exchange of 
    ballast water is required. This is<br>
    measured as three times the volume of the ballast tank exchange. From the 
    date of implementation (2009),<br>
    ships will be required to treat ballast water discharge to achieve less than 
    100 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL of intestinal enterococci and less 
    than 250CFU/100mL of Escherichia coli. Vibrio cholerae (O1,O139) should be 
    less than one CFU/100mL or less than one CFU/per one gram (wet weight) of<br>
    zooplankton samples. MARPOL 73/78 has been in force since 2003 and by 2006, 
    113 countries or<br>
    75 percent of active tonnage had signed the convention. In 2016, all vessels 
    will be required to treat their ballast water to comply with these microbial 
    levels.<br>
    <br>
    In April 2008, the US House of Representatives approved regulations 
    requiring all saltwater ships entering US ports to treat their ballast water 
    by 2016. The bill (HR 2830) sets a more demanding disinfection standard than 
    the IMO protocol and requires that the number of organisms greater than 50 
    microns in<br>
    minimum dimension be reduced to fewer than 10 living organisms per cubic 
    meter of water in the discharged ballast water. Chemical or biocide-based 
    methods of disinfecting ballast water are unattractive from a number of 
    perspectives. The proximity of bulk chemicals poses handling and storage 
    risk to the ships<br>
    crew and often a de-chlorination process is required to ensure that no 
    active substance or residual is discharged. A number of innovative suppliers 
    are enhancing the production of hydroxyl radicals with the exposure of an 
    accelerant such as titanium dioxide to UV light. A dedicated joint group of 
    experts on the<br>
    scientific aspects of marine environmental protection (GESAMP)7 now has a 
    ballast water technical work group (Work Group 34) in place.<br>
    <br>
    The focus of Work Group 34 is to determine what risk is posed by the 
    discharge of a variety of active substances. Hydroxyl species are a novel 
    addition to their usual list of chemical residuals to investigate. These 
    reactive species are very short lived and the ballast water has a high 
    hydroxyl demand.<br>
    <br>
    <b>How does UV work?</b><br>
    The ballast water is prepared for UV disinfection using a variety of filters 
    or cyclonic separators. The systems are usually skid mounted and automated; 
    the UV systems have automatic wiping and the filters automatic backwashing. 
    UV works by permanently damaging the DNA of all living organisms. The 
    damaged (or dimerized) DNA is no longer able to support normal cell function 
    and the organism is rendered non viable.<br>
    The sizing of the UV system is determined by: (a) flow rate; (b) 
    transmittance of the fluid to ultraviolet light and (c) the dose 
    requirement. The method is non- intrusive and does not alter the chemistry, 
    color or physical property of the ballast water. <br>
    <br>
    Different organisms have demonstrated varied resistance to UV. A growing 
    number of organisms are being found to be highly resistant to chlorine and 
    many of these emerging pathogens are effectively disinfected using UV. UV 
    dose is expressed in mJ cm-2. Most of the leading UV manufacturers use CFD 
    (computational fluid dynamics) models to predict the performance of the UV 
    systems. Working in partnership with BWT system providers, they use a 
    variety of validation techniques to determine the actual UV system 
    performance in the BWT process. Preparation of ballast water is very 
    important, as color,<br>
    suspended solids and particulates would render the UV ineffective.<br>
    <br>
    CFD modeling expertise and accuracy has advanced significantly in the last 
    five years. And leading UV system manufacturers such as Sollux, Trojan and 
    ATG use proprietary software models to integrate flow and radiation 
    profiles.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Flow profile</b><br>
    The flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate and 
    particular turbulence model selected.<br>
    The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp 
    type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length) and the 
    transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve.<br>
    <br>
    Proprietary CFD software simulates both flow and radiation profiles. Once a 
    3-D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that 
    comprises thousands of small cubes. Points of interest (such as at a bend) 
    or the quartz sleeve surface or around the wiper mechanism use a higher 
    resolution mesh, while other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh.<br>
    <br>
    Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are 
    ‘fired’ through the chamber.<br>
    Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it and the 
    particles are ‘harvested’ after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling 
    produces delivered dose, head loss and other chamber specific parameters.<br>
    <br>
    <b>System analysis</b><br>
    For system approval, on-shore and ship-based process validation is conducted 
    to ensure that the system is capable of performing as required. Fouling of 
    quartz sleeves can occur and prevent the UV light from penetrating into the 
    water. Iron is often present in ballast/bilge water, as the marine 
    environment is aggressive and materials coming into contact with it need to 
    be carefully selected. In addition to iron, ballast water can often contain 
    oils and lubricants and has a high oxygen demand. Effective wipers are 
    critical to the UV system performance. BWT systems are now also being 
    evaluated as part of the US Coast Guard STEP8 program in the US and are 
    undergoing IMO-type approval through the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency 
    (MCA) in cooperation with Lloyd’s Register.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion</b><br>
    Much damage has been done by the inadvertent transit through ballast 
    discharge of a great many nuisance<br>
    species. However, it does seem that this area is finally getting the 
    attention it deserves.<br>
    <br>
    UV systems are rapidly gaining acceptance as part of small system ballast 
    water treatment packages. Performance of the UV system depends critically on 
    the ability of the upstream filters and separators to adequately treat the 
    ballast water. Ratification and implementation of the IMO ballast water 
    management<br>
    convention will soon make it a criminal act to discharge untreated ballast 
    water. Neither the very international nature of the shipping business, nor 
    the intense competitive pressures caused by high<br>
    and rising fuel costs will be acceptable reasons for non-compliance. Nor 
    will the absence of a global regulation for such small systems be 
    acceptable.<br>

    Village officials are studying water plant plan</b><br>
    <font size="1">Poughkeepsie Journal, By Michael Woyton</font><br>
    </p><p>WAPPINGERS FALLS, N.Y. - Village officials are considering a proposal to 
    repair and replace the water plant. The $3.75 million project would include 
    the drilling of an additional well, installation of an ultraviolet light 
    disinfection system and expanding existing water plant buildings.<br>
    <br>
    "The goal is to be 100 percent dependent on our own source (for water) and 
    completely separated from the Poughkeepsie source," town engineer Jay Paggi 
    said.<br>
    <br>
    High iron and bacteria levels in the Wappinger Lake aquifer forced the state 
    Department of Health to shut down village wells in October 2006. The village 
    has been buying water from the City/Town of Poughkeepsie Joint Water Board 
    since that time under a five-year contract.<br>
    <br>
    Mayor Matt Alexander said the cost of buying water from the joint board is 
    $350 per year per household. With 1,600 households, the cost is $560,000 or 
    $2.8 million over the course of the five-year contract.<br>
    <br>
    Under the proposed time-table, the village would be capable of producing and 
    distributing its own water by 2011, which is when the contract with the 
    joint board expires.<br>
    <br>
    Light instead of chlorine<br>
    Paggi said ultraviolet light was chosen as a primary disinfectant over 
    traditional chlorine. That is because for chlorine to be effective, the 
    water must be stored while the chemical disinfects it. A tank large enough 
    for that procedure would be costly to build and maintain, Paggi said.<br>
    <br>
    He said the plant's electrical and control systems will be modernized, 
    allowing the operator to easily monitor water flow at distant locations.<br>
    <br>
    Under the proposal, security for the system will be installed, along with a 
    backup power generator.<br>
    <br>
    Only two of the now-existing four wells will continue to operate. A third 
    well will be drilled as a backup to ensure peak daily demand of 700 gallons 
    per minute can be met.<br>
    <br>
    Village resident Bob Camenga was concerned if the well field would be able 
    to generate water for a long period of time.<br>
    <br>
    "In the year of a drought, will we have enough?" he asked.<br>
    <br>
    Paggi said the computer model used to calculate adequate flow assumed a 
    worst-case scenario of no rainfall for 700 days.<br>
    <br>
    Alexander said the next steps were for the water commission to complete an 
    environmental impact study for the project.<br>
    <br>
    Then the village trustees would pass a resolution authorizing the borrowing 
    of the money.</p>

    Naples water to get UV treatment</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">MPNNow.com, By Emily McFaul</font><br>
    </p><p>Naples, N.Y. - Besides filtering public water, Naples’ new system will 
    use ultraviolet light as an extra step to prevent contamination.<br>
    <br>
    The ultraviolet treatment — called UV for short — wasn’t part of the state 
    mandate that Naples filter the water from its Eelpot and Blodget reservoirs, 
    but the Village Board opted to add it now in the hope of saving money down 
    the road.<br>
    <br>
    JP Schepp of Chatfield Engineers told the Village Board at a recent project 
    planning meeting that the cryptosporidium and giardia microorganisms that 
    can get into surface waters — and that the state is most concerned about — 
    are large enough to be caught in the bag-and-cartridge filters. Both cause 
    intestinal illness. The UV lights will treat the water that’s already run 
    through the filter. <br>
    <br>
    “It’s kind of suspenders and a belt,” Schepp said. “But that’s not a bad 
    thing.”<br>
    <br>
    While a UV light inactivates bacteria and can disable harmful microorganisms 
    small enough to travel through a filter, it doesn’t replace the need for 
    filtration. The filters physically remove particulate matter before drinking 
    water goes through the UV treatment, explained Department of Health engineer 
    Sheryl Robbins, so that sediment or other contaminants don’t create 
    cloudiness that prevent the UV rays from reaching harmful microorganisms.
    <br>
    <br>
    And, chlorinating the water after it goes through the filters and UV 
    treatment helps maintain the cleanliness of the water if bacteria should be 
    re-introduced through leaks in the water lines.<br>
    In electing to add the UV treatment, the village was anticipating a round of 
    tests that municipalities are required to start running on public water 
    supplies in October. Tests are scheduled on a regular basis over a period of 
    one to two years and, depending on the type of microorganisms to be checked 
    for, could have cost the village anywhere between $2,400 to $24,000. Test 
    failures would have meant Naples would have been required to add the UV 
    treatments to its systems. <br>
    <br>
    Robbins said the village will now be excused from the additional testing 
    that begins this fall, since the Environmental Protection Agency considers 
    the multi-barrier approach that Naples plans to provide the maximum 
    treatment that can be given to water.<br>
    <br>
    Installing the UV treatment as part of the filtration project has been 
    estimated to cost around $64,000. The board agreed that buying the equipment 
    now, before costs rise and additional money is spent on testing, would be a 
    good investment. <br>
    <br>
    There may be other long-term operating savings. Robbins and Tom Schwartz, 
    the village’s superintendent of public works, told the board that the UV 
    equipment means the amount of chlorination in the treated water can be 
    reduced.<br>
    <br>
    The UV equipment isn’t strictly a line item in the filtration budget, since 
    the board agreed on the need for the treatment only at the tail end of 
    planning. But Schepp told the board that with a contingency fund of $120,000 
    and some leeway in how much is spent on other parts of the project, the 
    inclusion of the UV equipment shouldn’t present a problem.<br>
    <br>
    To stay on the compliance schedule agreed on with the state, designs for the 
    project are scheduled to be turned over to review agencies by Nov. 1. 
    Construction is slated to begin by July 1, 2009 and be completed in a year.<br>

    2008 and AQUATECH 2008 in Amsterdam.<br>
    The IWA World Water - Congress and Exhibition – takes place in Vienna, 
    September 8-11, 2008. AQUATECH, the world’s leading trade exhibition on 
    process, drinking and waste water technology, will be in Amsterdam, 
    September 30 to October 3, 2008.<br>
    <br>
    Heraeus Noblelight will be showing UV lamps which are used for drinking 
    water disinfection in waterworks, for wastewater treatment in sewage 
    treatment plants and for the treatment of industrial process water. These 
    include low pressure UVC lamps, compact, high power medium pressure UV lamps 
    and Longlife amalgam lamps. An innovative and powerful UV Amalgam Lamp will 
    be launched at AQUATECH in Amsterdam.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the conventional processes for cleaning water – such as the 
    use of chemicals like chlorine and ozone or filtration systems – the 
    importance of ultraviolet light as a reliable, environmentally friendly and 
    economically viable alternative is ever increasing.<br>
    <br>
    Since its development of UV medium pressure technology in 1904, Heraeus 
    Noblelight can look back to 100 years of experience in the development, 
    production and application of UV lamps. Through innovations such as Longlife 
    technology, Heraeus continues to set milestones in the field of UV lamps. 
    Heraeus Noblelight is an original equipment supplier and the partner of 
    choice for many systems builders involved in the disinfection of water, air 
    and surfaces, as well as for manufacturers of systems for photo-chemistry 
    and photo-oxidization.<br>

    Battling the Parasite in Your Local Pool</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">By ANNA PRIOR, The Wall Street Journal</font><br>
    <br>
    Rising infections from a chlorine-resistant parasite called Cryptosporidium 
    are forcing pools and water parks across the country to take new measures - 
    from ultraviolet-light water treatments to tighter swimming restrictions - 
    to keep their water clean.<br>
    <br>
    The parasite - commonly called crypto - is found in human and animal feces 
    and is easily transmitted through water. When ingested, crypto can cause an 
    illness of up to two weeks, with symptoms that include long bouts of 
    diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches and low-grade 
    fevers.<br>
    <br>
    Earlier this summer, city officials in Phoenix closed and disinfected the 
    city's 29 pools for a week after more than 100 people complained of illness 
    and a pool was found to have the parasite. A series of outbreaks last summer 
    in Utah sickened nearly 2,000 people. And an outbreak at a spray park in 
    Seneca Lake State Park in New York in 2005 caused more than 4,000 people to 
    seek medical help.<br>
    <br>
    Crypto outbreaks have been increasing over the past two decades, according 
    to Michael Beach, associate director for healthy water at the National 
    Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne and Enteric Diseases. The past few years 
    have seen a surge, with outbreaks at pools, spray parks - which feature 
    fountains and other spraying devices - and water parks jumping to around 25 
    in 2007 from five in 2003. Overall, outbreaks of waterborne gastrointestinal 
    disease rose to 30 in 2007 from seven in 2003.<br>
    <br>
    In 1993, crypto-infected drinking water in Milwaukee sickened more than 
    400,000 people and is thought to have killed more than 100. Still, many 
    people aren't aware that the illness can be contracted at swimming pools, as 
    well as ponds and other bodies of water. (Ocean-related outbreaks are very 
    rare.) The crypto parasite has a thick outer shell, so it can survive for 
    more than 10 days in a pool at standard chlorination levels.<br>
    <br>
    Last summer, when Jill Everett's 8-year-old son, Nathan, woke up one night 
    with wrenching stomach cramps and diarrhea, she never thought that his 
    symptoms were related to the swimming lessons he'd been taking at the local 
    pool. "I thought it was the stomach flu," says Ms. Everett, a 43-year-old 
    computer programmer in Bountiful, Utah.<br>
    <br>
    But three days later, Nathan was still sick, so Ms. Everett took him to the 
    doctor, where she learned he had crypto. "I had never even heard of it," she 
    says.<br>
    <br>
    Now, many water parks are installing ultraviolet systems, which kill 
    parasites including crypto when water passes through the systems' UV light. 
    Seven Peaks Water Park, in Provo, Utah, invested about $250,000 in UV 
    systems, said the park's maintenance engineer, Ken Kroeber. Park officials 
    were concerned after some people who became ill in last year's outbreak said 
    they had swum there, though the water wasn't ever tested for the parasite, 
    he said.<br>
    <br>
    In Utah, state public-health officials want anyone who has had diarrhea to 
    stay away from pools - including water parks and hotel and apartment pools - 
    for two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn people 
    who have had the illness to stay out of pools for at least two weeks after 
    they get better.<br>
    <br>
    The CDC is working with industry representatives and public-health officials 
    to put together the Model Aquatic Health Code - a set of CDC-endorsed 
    water-safety guidelines that state and local agencies will enforce. To 
    address current concerns about crypto, a section on dealing with bodily 
    fluids is expected to be posted on the CDC's Web site for public comment 
    within several weeks.<br>
    <br>
    Since crypto isn't affected by chlorine (except at levels unsafe for 
    humans), combating the parasite will require not only pool officials but 
    also swimmers to shift their thinking. "It's a change in understanding on 
    the part of the people that swim," says Jonathan Yoder, who coordinates the 
    CDC's water-borne-disease outbreak surveillance system. "It's important for 
    them to understand they can transmit illness when they swim when they're 
    ill. The water is not sterile."<br>
    <br>
    Current safety rules may not always protect swimmers. In Utah, new state 
    rules require kids who still use diapers to wear swim diapers and waterproof 
    pants in pools. But swim diapers won't necessarily prevent the spread of 
    crypto. "No product either durable or disposable is designed to contain 
    bowel movements while under water for a long time," says Lance Latham, a 
    spokesman for Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies Little Swimmers diapers. 
    "Little Swimmers are not intended to contain diarrhea."<br>
    <br>
    Still, swimmers can take steps to stay safe. While chlorine doesn't affect 
    crypto at normal levels, it does kill other illness-causing agents, such as 
    E. coli, giardia and hepatitis A. Underchlorination of pools can allow such 
    diseases to spread. To test unfamiliar waters, people can purchase 
    chlorination-testing strips at most hardware stores.<br>
    <br>
    After a quick dip in the water, the strips take about 15 to 30 seconds to 
    work. Colors on the strips indicate whether levels of "free chlorine, ph and 
    total alkalinity" are safe in the pool. If the levels are not where they 
    should be, swimmers can tell a pool manager or call the local health 
    department, says the CDC's Dr. Beach.<br>
    <br>
    Another way to battle the threat of a crypto outbreak is for more pools to 
    require swimmers to shower before entering the pool. A public pool is "a 
    public bath tub," Dr. Beach says. "We need to keep things sanitary."<br>

    UV for Wisconsin village groundwater</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Water Tech Online</font><br>
    <br>
    PRAIRIE DU SAC, WI — Prairie Du Sac, which uses groundwater to supply its 
    drinking water, now relies solely on ultraviolet (UV) light for 
    disinfection, according to a July 17 article in The Sauk Prairie Eagle.<br>
    <br>
    According to the article, this system is one of the first of its kind 
    nationwide to disinfect with UV. Mark Borchardt, a research scientist at the 
    Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation based in Marshfield, WI, said in the 
    article, “They might be only the third municipality in the nation to do this 
    for a groundwater system.”<br>
    <br>
    Borchardt chose Prairie du Sac as one of 14 municipalities in Wisconsin for 
    a federally funded study to determine the link between municipal groundwater 
    and gastrointestinal illnesses in children, the article said. None of the 
    municipalities chosen for the study, including Prairie du Sac, disinfected 
    its drinking water, the article said.<br>
    <br>
    Municipalities using groundwater systems that are not affected by surface 
    water, such as Prairie du Sac, are not required by law to disinfect their 
    water supplies. Borchardt said his study could change that. <br>
    <br>
    During Borchardt's two-year study, selected families in the 14 communities 
    maintained weekly health logs and Borchardt collected regular water samples 
    from their homes. <br>
    <br>
    The water remained untreated for one year of the study and for one year the 
    water supply was disinfected by passing through concentrated UV light. <br>
    <br>
    Borchardt will release his full findings for all 14 communities later this 
    year in a peer-reviewed journal. <br>
    <br>
    He informally told the village that his findings showed disinfecting the 
    water had a positive impact on community health, which Wildman said prompted 
    the village to purchase the UV light reactors used in the study.<br>

    CDC recommends UV or ozone disinfection for pools</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Water Tech Online</font><br>
    <br>
    ATLANTA — Findings of a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
    study about the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and other parasites in 
    swimming pool filter backwash suggest that there is a need for continued 
    emphasis on improving swimming pool operation and maintenance, such as 
    preventive hyperchlorination or routine flocculation, combined with 
    supplementary inline disinfection systems such as ultraviolet light (UV) or 
    ozone.<br>
    <br>
    The study, “Prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia intestinalis in 
    swimming pools, Atlanta, Georgia,” was published in the June 2008 issue of 
    the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.<br>
    <br>
    UV and ozone are known to inactivate Giardia sp. and Cryptosporidium spp., 
    both gastrointestinal parasites spread through the fecal-oral route, 
    according to the study’s authors, Joan M. Shields, et al.<br>
    <br>
    According to the study’s abstract, “Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia 
    intestinalis have been found in swimming pool filter backwash during 
    outbreaks. To determine baseline prevalence, we sampled pools not associated 
    with outbreaks and found that of 160 sampled pools, 13 (8.1 percent) were 
    positive for 1 or both parasites; 10 (6.2 percent) for Giardia sp.; 2 (1.2 
    percent) for Cryptosporidium spp.;, and 1 (0.6 percent) for both.”<br>
    <br>
    While the authors write that the study is “a snapshot of contamination at 
    the end of the swim season,” they conclude that “the finding of swimming 
    pool filter contamination by Giardia sp. and Cryptosporidium spp. is key,” 
    reinforcing the need for improved pool operation and maintenance. UV and 
    ozone are both listed as supplementary inline disinfection systems that 
    should be considered.<br>
    <br>
    The authors also write that the general public, especially immunocompromised 
    persons, need to understand recreational water–associated illness 
    transmission and adopt healthy swimming habits that are needed to reduce the 
    risk for pathogen transmission. <br>

    UV light helps to ensure safe bathing during the summer months </a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Environmental Expert</font><br>
    <br>
    • Ultraviolet light kills bacteria in wastewater without the need for 
    chemicals and allows safe bathing in the Isar.<br>
    • Reliable and environmentally friendly method<br>
    • Used in the project “Clean Isar” in a large number of clarification plants 
    in Bavaria/Germany.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the conventional processes for cleaning water – such as the 
    use of chemicals like chlorine and ozone or filtration systems – the 
    importance of ultraviolet light as a reliable, environmentally friendly and 
    economically viable alternative is ever increasing.<br>
    <br>
    Communal wastewater, after being cleaned in clarification plants, is 
    reintroduced into the water cycle, into rivers, lakes and coastal waters. 
    Special treatment is necessary if, at subsequent points, drinking water is 
    extracted or wastewater is fed back to bathing waters. If the wastewater has 
    a high germ count then the hygienic conditions for bathing become doubtful 
    as there are significant dangers of infection for humans.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Project “Clean Isar” – A Decision for UV</b><br>
    The city of Munich and the State of Bavaria started a project to improve the 
    hygienic water quality of the Isar river, to ensure safe bathing during the 
    summer months. One part of the Isar is diverted into the Isar canal and used 
    for energy generation. As a result, the remaining Isar between the cities of 
    Bad Toelz and Freising carries very little water. By introducing cleaned 
    wastewater from the clarification plants in this area the degree of 
    contamination was high, in spite of sufficient treatment, and the water was 
    heavy with pathogens. <br>
    The Europe-wide, unique “Clean Isar” project included the decision to use UV 
    wastewater disinfection as the final cleaning stage in the sewage treatment 
    plants which fed the wastewater back into the river. The aim was to 
    significantly reduce the germ count of the waste waters and so improve the 
    hygienic water quality of the Isar in the bathing season, while meeting the 
    severe EU bathing water regulations. In 2000, the Bavarian State showed 
    evidence from the pilot scheme for wastewater disinfection in Bad Toelz that 
    bathing water quality could be achieved in the Isar. Hygienic considerations 
    are decisive for the bathing water quality. Contamination of the water, for 
    example by pathogens, can cause illnesses in the bathers. Bacteria and 
    viruses play an important role, particularly, fecal germs, streptococci, 
    salmonella and enteric viruses.<br>
    <br>
    Ultraviolet light inactivates bacteria in wastewater without the addition of 
    chemicals. The treatment of water with UV radiation is a very effective 
    physical process for reliably disinfecting water and breaking down 
    pollutants. The energy-rich radiation, at wavelengths of around 254 
    nanometers is absorbed by the DNA and destroys its structure. As a result, 
    the UV rays, in a matter of seconds, destroy the cells of the pathogens in 
    the water, such as bacteria, micro-organisms, viruses, fungi or parasites. 
    In addition, chlorine-resistant parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidia 
    can be killed by UV light. Pathogens cannot develop any resistance to UV 
    light. An important benefit is that this cleaning process takes place 
    completely without chemicals and hence there are no chemical residuals.<br>
    <br>
    UV light is versatile in its application – it can be used to treat water, 
    air and surfaces. Drinking water treatment in waterworks, wastewater 
    treatment in sewage treatment plants or process water treatment in industry 
    (typically, the recycling and re-use of process water) are the interesting 
    applications of UV in the water industry.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Disinfection with ultraviolet light becomes more and more accepted</b><br>
    The physical method of disinfection with UVC light is a reliable and 
    economical technique, which is often used for the disinfection of water. For 
    example, the city of New York has chosen this technology for drinking water 
    disinfection for new waterworks which are planned for the Catskill/Delaware 
    catchment area about 160 kilometer north of New York city. This will be the 
    largest UV disinfection plant for drinking water in the world. From 2010, 
    the new waterworks will treat up to 2.2 billion gallons (8.3 million cubic 
    meters) of water per day for more than nine million people in New York city 
    and its environs.<br>
    <br>
    In recent years, the acceptance of UV disinfection in commercial 
    applications has continued to grow. UV disinfection has been successfully 
    used for wastewater treatment in the USA for decades and is now becoming 
    increasingly specified in Europe, as in the Isar project.<br>
    <br>
    The town of Freising has also setteled for wastewater disinfection through 
    UV radiation to provide hygienic wastewater and clean water in the Isar. The 
    sewage treatment plant in Freising treats around 5 million m³ of wastewater 
    (per day) from the town of Freising, its commercial companies (Dairy, 
    breweries) and eight neighboring townships. Within the scope of the “Clean 
    Isar” project, the Freising plant was completely modernized and enlarged. 
    Today the clarification plant is designed for an 110,000 inhabitant value. 
    In addition, the water rights application meets stricter limits and the 
    escapage loss has been drastically reduced. The plant expansion includes a 
    new biological treatment plant, settling tanks, a fish pond, new CHP plants 
    and a UV disinfection plant.<br>
    <br>
    Freising decided upon a plant from the Canadian manufacturer TROJAN 
    technologies. This was installed in September 2005 and began operation in 
    the summer of 2006. An important plus point was the sophisticated wiper 
    technology of the TrojanUV3000Plus system, which continuously removes any 
    dirt or deposits from the quartz safety tubes. This possible coating, which 
    is often ferrous, leads to a reduction in the UV intensity in the water.<br>
    <br>
    The UV plant in Freising is fitted with 196 UV lamps, each of 250 Watt 
    output. The UV lamps are contained in UV-transparent Quartz glass tubes, 
    which are tightly sealed. Two open channels work with two corresponding 
    banks, which are each fitted with six modules. The plant is self-regulated 
    according to the wastewater throughput. Depending on the throughput and the 
    water transmission, one channel is operated with the necessary number of 
    modules. The lamp power can be controlled between 60% and 100% intensity. An 
    SPS controller automatically regulated the operating mode. A UV sensor 
    continually monitors the UV lamp intensity and an on-line measurement of 
    water transmission matches the power to the demand. <br>
    <br>
    The Freising plant is designed for a maximum of 652 liters per second (2350 
    m³/hour). Maximum input is 611 liters per second. This ensures that the 
    capacity of the UV plant is sufficient to handle the maximum expected 
    wastewater input. The plant delivers a UV dose of 306J/m², which ensure 
    certain UV disinfection.<br>
    <br>
    An external, independent laboratory takes monthly samples and tests the 
    water quality. The samples are taken before and after the UV plant and look 
    out for faecal germs and streptococci. The regional authority also monitors 
    the wastewater quality. This takes the form of unannounced, monthly sampling 
    to check bathing water quality.<br>
    <br>
    Willi Frankl, manager of the Freising sewage works says of his experiences, 
    “The plant stands or falls on the UV lamps. The operating life of the lamps 
    is a decisive factor. The later I have to change over lamps, the more 
    economical the UV plant.”<br>
    <br>
    The energy efficiency of the UV disinfection plants in communal 
    clarification plants can be improved by using particularly efficient UV 
    lamps. The challenge for today’s UV lamps is to significantly increase their 
    efficiency and operating life.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Different Lamp Technologies for Water Treatment</b><br>
    The disinfection of water can involve the use of compact medium pressure UV 
    lamps, low pressure UV lamps and high power amalgam lamps.<br>
    <br>
    Medium pressure lamps give a broad band spectrum over the complete range 
    from 200 to 400 nanometers. Their high radiation flux allows very good 
    disinfection from compact units. Similarly, with high throughput, it is 
    possible to design very compact disinfection systems. For example, these 
    lamps are used on board ships where space is very limited to disinfect 
    ballast water. Typical lamp operating life is 1500 to 5000 hours.<br>
    <br>
    Low pressure lamps emit radiation at a wavelength of 254 nanometers. 
    Classical UV low pressure lamps offer exceptional efficiency: up to 40% of 
    the electrical power is converted into UV radiation for disinfection. 
    However, the power density is limited and a large number of lamps is often 
    required. When synthetic quartz glass is used as the lamp material, 
    additional UV radiation at 185 nanometers is emitted and this can be used 
    for oxidation processes. The first lamp change is normally after 8000 hours. 
    After this the lamps exhibit a drop-off in UV intensity of up to 50 percent.<br>
    <br>
    However, there are significantly longer life lamps. For example, the 
    specialist light source manufacturer, Heraeus Noblelight, has developed new 
    high power, amalgam lamps, which operate for up to 16,000 hours with 
    virtually constant UV output and so provide significantly more power than 
    conventional standard low pressure lamps, with their usual operating life of 
    8000 hours. A unique longlife coating doubles the life of amalgam lamps. 
    This new technology not only improves the useful life of the lamps but also 
    ensure a virtually constant UV output over the length of this working life.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, with the new coating, high power amalgam lamps can eliminate 
    the transmission loss of quartz glass which is associated with conventional 
    lamps, so that a virtually constant disinfection action is achieved over the 
    complete operating life. With conventional UV lamps, mercury diffuses into 
    the quartz, so that such lamps deliver only 50% of the original UV power 
    after 8000 hours. The new technology allows up to 16000 hours of operation 
    at virtually constant UV output and consequently significantly more power 
    overall than conventional lamps.<br>
    <br>
    In comparison with previous lamp technology, UV amalgam lamps offer the best 
    combination of efficiency and operating life. Thanks to the higher UV output 
    and the long operating life, system builders now need fewer lamps in any new 
    disinfection plants they design. As a result there is significant potential 
    for saving in the number of lamps, in system components, in energy demands 
    and in maintenance and service costs. End users, such as waterworks and 
    clarification plants, profit from the long operating life. The time between 
    lamp changes is virtually doubled while the operating time provides the 
    lamps with more UV power than conventional low pressure lamps.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Outlook – New areas of application for UV radiation</b><br>
    The increasing environmental pollution caused by medications in wastewater 
    is becoming more of a problem. In order to destroy the very complex 
    pharmaceuticals such as steroids and antibiotics, it is sensible and 
    effective to use a combination of UV radiation and powerful oxidation 
    substances such as hydrogen peroxide. UV radiation at a wavelength of 185 
    nanometers makes even higher energies available and allows oxidization 
    processes, which can break down health-threatening chemicals in water. <br>

New Application for UV Lamps in Agriculture<br>
    - Swiss Company Develops PhytO3-machines with UV lamps from Heraeus 
    Noblelight<br>
    - Eliminates Pesticides<br>
    - Patented Method<br>
    <br>
    UV lamps from Heraeus Noblelight are used to treat water, air and work 
    surfaces. Often, these specialist light sources find application in the 
    treatment of drinking water or in the disinfection of packaging materials in 
    the foodstuffs industry.<br>
    <br>
    The destruction of micro-organisms with UV light is now also taking place in 
    the agricultural sector. The Swiss company SwissFood Tech Management AG, 
    following its field tests carri9ed out in 2006, is now using UV lamps from 
    Heraeus Noblelight in its PhytO3 machine, which uses the combination of 
    ozonised water and UV light for the treatment of agricultural fields in 
    order to replace the use of pesticides and insecticides.<br>
    <br>
    PhytO3 Method With UV Light Replaces Pesticides.<br>
    The PhytO3 process replaces the use of pesticides by using the combination 
    of ozonised water and UV light. Extensive field research has validated the 
    effectiveness of this process.<br>
    <br>
    In operation, a structure suspended at the end of a tractor is equipped with 
    Heraeus lamps. Ozone is generated by silent electrical discharge in a 
    separate unit, which is mounted on the forks at the front of the tractor, 
    and is dissolved in water. The PhytO3 method combines two effects: the 
    plants are sprayed with ozonised water and irradiated with UVC light. 
    Biological pests often live on plant surfaces. Small animals, such as 
    beetles, are simply sprayed with water on the ground but are not destroyed. 
    Micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria and moulds on the plants are 
    targeted and destroyed in a controlled manner by UVC radiation at a 
    wavelength of 254nm. The energy rich UVC radiation neutralises 
    micro-organisms, as it damages the genetic make-up. In addition, the UV 
    radiation activates the ozone enriching the water on the plant surface and 
    generates excited oxygen. This destroys the cell walls of the 
    micro-organisms.<br>
    <br>
    By the removal of the pests, the risk of plant damage or damage to the field 
    is significantly reduced. This pesticide technique, employing UV lamps, is 
    environmentally-friendly and there is no need for chemicals. There are no 
    biological or chemical residuals on the plant surfaces, in the soil or in 
    the environment. The ozone will usually decay within a maximum of 15 
    minutes, i.e, some time after the spraying takes place the ozone 
    concentration falls to zero.<br>
    <br>
    UV-Amalgam Lamps from Heraeus Noblelight <br>
    The amalgam lamps used in the PhytO3 method generate UV radiation at a 
    wavelength of 254 Nanometers.<br>
    <br>
    Longlife Amalgam lamps, as the name implies, are high power, low pressure 
    lamps with extremely long operating lives. They can achieve up to ten times 
    the UV power density of classical mercury low pressure lamps and are 
    insensitive to temperature fluctuations. Heraeus Amalgam lamps are fitted 
    with a unique coating, which prevents the transmission loses of quartz glass 
    associated with conventional UV lamps. The result is a virtually constant 
    disinfection sanction throughout the lamp’s life.<br>

    Ultraviolet light plan to kill bug</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Daventry Express</font><br>
    <br>
    ANGLIAN Water will use ultraviolet light to kill parasites currently 
    contaminating tap water in the Daventry area. The company is installing 
    three units at the Pitsford Water Treatment Works which will shine 
    ultraviolet rays into the water, rendering the cryptosporidium parasite 
    harmless.<br>
    <br>
    However, it could still be a matter of a couple of weeks before the supply 
    is safe to drink and Anglian Water is advising customers to continue boiling 
    tap water until further notice.<br>
    <br>
    A spokesman for Anglian Water said: "We have brought in three ultraviolet 
    units and this is a well known technology for rendering cryptosporidium 
    harmless." "We have to go through a very thorough testing of the water to 
    make sure it is back to up to the excellent quality of tap water.<br>
    <br>
    "We have numerous resources in terms of man hours in terms of installing the 
    UV light equipment and finding out the cause. The investigations into how 
    the parasite got into the water is still on-going.<br>
    "We would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused by 
    these problems and we hope they feel reassured that we are doing everything 
    we can to return the tap water to the high standards we had previously."<br>
    <br>
    Anglian Water has also confirmed provisional plans to set up an information 
    service at Daventry District Council's offices, but nothing formal has yet 
    been announced. <br>

    ITT completes EPA validation for world’s most efficient UV drinking water 
    system</a></b><br>
    <br>
    ATLANTA - (BUSINESS WIRE) - ITT Corporation (NYSE: ITT), a leading provider 
    of systems for treating and transporting water and wastewater, announced 
    today that it has completed a new validation for ITT’s WEDECO K Series 
    Ultraviolet (UV) Reactor according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 
    standards. The WEDECO K Series UV reactor is the most efficient large scale 
    drinking water system using UV disinfection on the world market. <br>
    <br>
    UV disinfection of drinking water is a safe and reliable way to protect 
    public health from waterborne diseases. Since UV light has the ability to 
    sterilize pathogenic microorganisms within seconds, it has been widely 
    implemented in many water treatment facilities throughout the world. The 
    WEDECO K Series UV Reactor offers significant cost savings for large scale 
    drinking water UV projects. The WEDECO UV systems are using low pressure, 
    high-output UV lamps, so the operating costs are typically less than half of 
    the leading medium pressure lamp systems available. <br>
    <br>
    The WEDECO K Series UV reactor underwent all possible design scenarios 
    during the validation, with flow rates up to 40 million gallons per day. In 
    addition to the upcoming drinking water projects, more than 100 installed K 
    Series vessels in North America can now be certified according to the latest 
    USEPA guidelines. <br>

    School Board Approves UV Sanitation System</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Christina Rowland, Southlake Times</font><br>
    <br>
    The Carroll ISD Board of Trustees is hoping an investment of almost $100,000 
    will help those suffering with asthma to swim a bit easier.<br>
    <br>
    The school board approved the purchase Monday of a $92,000 UV sanitation 
    system that would work in conjunction with two other sanitation systems 
    already in use to help decrease the amount of chemicals put into the pool.<br>
    <br>
    “It (the UV system) kills germs in the pool by using a high ultraviolet 
    light. It oxidizes chloramines in the water and kills them,” Assistant 
    Superintendent for Administrative Services Dr. Derek Citty said, “as they 
    pass through the light it changes them to a chemical that is not harmful to 
    inhale.”<br>
    <br>
    The system will cut down on the chemicals and chlorine that are currently 
    put in the pool to sanitize it, and the daunting smell that one gets when 
    they step into a natatorium should be gone.<br>
    <br>
    The systems will be installed by Sunbelt Pools of Dallas and will cost 
    roughly $92,000. The system also has four light bulbs that have to be 
    replaced roughly once a year to keep it running effectively. The cost of 
    each one of those bulbs is $1,000. “The cost will be offset by the amount we 
    save on chlorine,” Citty said. “It will be paid for out of fund balance.”<br>
    <br>
    Outside of school groups, user fees are charged. The board does not 
    anticipate any of these fees going up as a result of the new system.<br>
    <br>
    “The water in that pool never sits still,” Citty said. “We have diving 
    programs, water polo, senior activities and that pool is used by hundreds of 
    people everyday.”<br>
    <br>
    Other cities in the area have installed the system; such as the Oak Point 
    natatorium in Plano, The City of Allen Natatorium, Denton Natatorium, SMU 
    Perkins Natatorium and the city of Frisco.<br>
    <br>
    “We should have done this eight years ago but the technology wasn’t there,” 
    Recreation Complex Supervisor for Oak Point Pool K’Ann Parham said. “It is 
    an expensive system up front but it is well worth the cost.”<br>
    <br>
    Parham explained that it wasn’t her asthmatic kids that were complaining, it 
    was her swim and dive teams and now that the system has been installed 
    everything is much better. Parham also confirmed that her pool has saved 
    money on chemicals because they do not have to put as many in now that they 
    have the new sanitation system. They purchased their system last fall.<br>
    <br>
    “Our board is kid-centered,” Citty said. “They view this as something that 
    can benefit hundreds of kids. The introduction of the system will help kids 
    with asthma and destroy chloramines.”<br>
    <br>
    The system is thought to last for a long time because it is made out of 
    stainless steel and shouldn’t rust. According to Citty the system also has 
    no moving parts. The system is set to be installed in late August. The pool 
    will close from Aug. 2 to 18 to install the system and perform routine 
    matenience needed for the pool.<br>

    Moscow Sewage Water to Be Purified With UV</b><br>
    <font size="1">Interfax</font><br>
    <br>
    Ultraviolet (UV) sewage water purification technology will be introduced at 
    all Moscow water purification stations by 2014, the Moscow Water Supply 
    Service (Mosvodokanal) told Interfax on Tuesday. <br>
    <br>
    "Back in 2007, one of the largest UV-decontamination plants in the world 
    processing 1 million cubic meters of water in 24 hours was brought into 
    action at the Lubertsy purification plant," he said. <br>
    <br>
    "This technology reduced the station's load on purifying sewage from 
    nitrogen and phosphorus by 5,600 tonnes, or 14%, in 2007 and by 7,510 tonnes, 
    or 12%, in all the monitored months," he said. <br>
    <br>
    The employment of this technology at Moscow purification stations will help 
    significantly improve the quality of water in the Moscow River both within 
    the city boundaries and in its lower reaches and will also have a positive 
    effect on the environment in the regions adjacent to the Volga and Oka river 
    basins, he said.</p>

    Goodman Pool gets $10,000 for UV purification</b><br>
    <font size="1">The Capital Times, Madison, WI</font><br>
    <br>
    The Madison City Council voted Tuesday night to give the Parks Division an 
    additional $10,000 for the installation of an ultraviolet water purification 
    system at the Goodman Pool.<br>
    <br>
    Pool Manager Bonnie Griswold said the UV water treatment system is needed in 
    addition to chlorine as a safeguard to keep the water clean.<br>
    <br>
    Nationally, the 2007 swim season saw a 24 percent hike in Cryptosporidium 
    outbreaks, including one in the Salt Lake City area that led to children 
    under 5 being banned from city pools, Griswold told the council.<br>
    <br>
    Germs causing recreational water illnesses are killed by chlorine, but 
    chlorine is a slow acting disinfectant, she said.<br>
    <br>
    The Goodman pool closed 16 times last year due to fecal accidents. It takes 
    about 45 minutes to inactivate E. coli, the hepatitis A virus, and the 
    giardia parasite, Griswold said.<br>
    <br>
    In other cases it takes time to kill the germs and some germs like 
    Cryptosporidium can live in a pool for days, she said.<br>
    <br>
    "It would be difficult for our facility to survive that," Griswold told the 
    council. It would interrupt the pool's programming and erode the public's 
    confidence, she said.<br>
    <br>
    UV light, which is used in other Madison pools, acts instantly and provides 
    a non-chemical, environmentally friendly treatment option to address both 
    chlorine resistant pathogens and chloramines -- which are irritating to a 
    person's eyes and skin.<br>
    <br>
    The new technology is highly effective and reliable, Griswold said.<br>
    <br>
    State legislation is pending that requires UV water purification and 
    filtering systems in all future public pools.<br>
    <br>
    As more people use the Goodman pool, there are going to be more outbreaks, 
    Griswold said.<br>
    <br>
    It's a matter of educating the public that children shouldn't be swimming 
    when they are ill, and that young children should wear waterproof diapers or 
    "Little Swimmers" when they go swimming, she said.</p>

    Aqua New Jersey Receives Award for UV Treatment Plant from Water Resources 
    Association</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">HAMILTON, N.J.-(BUSINESS WIRE)</font><br>
    <br>
    <b>$2.2 Million Facility Is a First Using UV Disinfection in New Jersey</b><br>
    <br>
    Aqua New Jersey, Inc. (Aqua) received the Business &amp; Industry Award from the 
    Water Resources Association of the Delaware River Basin’s (WRA) at its 26th 
    Annual Recognition Dinner held last night in Philadelphia. <br>
    <br>
    Aqua received the award for the installation of advanced ultraviolet (UV) 
    water treatment in New Jersey. <br>
    <br>
    The state-of-the-art UV treatment facility, located in Lopatcong Township, 
    uses UV light treatment to enhance water quality for approximately 10,600 
    Aqua in Phillipsburg and Lopatcong, Pohatcong and Greenwich townships. Aqua 
    was the first utility to use UV in this particular type of application and 
    on this scale. <br>
    <br>
    Aqua New Jersey President William Davis accepted the award on behalf of the 
    company. “We are extremely proud to have been selected this prestigious 
    award from such an important organization in our industry and our region,” 
    said Davis. “These treatment facilities demonstrate how creative thinking 
    coupled with technology can lead to cost-efficient solutions that serve 
    public health and protect the environment.” <br>
    <br>
    If Aqua had proceeded to build a traditional filtration plant, the cost 
    could have been as much as $12 million. Davis said the company was able to 
    effect the more affordable solution thanks to the New Jersey Department of 
    Environmental Protection acceptance of the company’s proposed solution. The 
    UV treatment facility has a capacity of 10.5 million gallons per day. Inside 
    the plant, untreated water is disinfected with chlorine and then flows 
    through a chamber where UV lights “saturate” the water. This “one-two punch” 
    provides two distinct disinfection mechanisms, which effectively eliminate 
    micro-organisms from what is already a very clean water source from wells 
    along the Delaware River. <br>
    <br>
    Aqua provides water and wastewater services to 150,000 residents across 
    eight counties in New Jersey. It is a subsidiary of Aqua America, Inc., a 
    large U.S.-based publicly-traded water company, serving approximately three 
    million residents in 13 states.<br>

    Wonnacott said the method, which as been used in the pharmaceutical 
    industry, works just as well as typical chemical cleaning methods.<br>
    <br>
    Once the packaging is used at the store level, it is transported back to 
    Fresh &amp; Easy’s distribution center, where it is sent through the machine to 
    be sanitized and disinfected.<br>
    <br>
    Fresh &amp; Easy has made a commitment to reuse or recycle all of its packaging 
    and display materials.<br>
    <br>
    Through efforts like UV sanitization, Fresh &amp; Easy avoided releasing more 
    than 111,000 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from trucks 
    transporting waste to landfills, according to the company. Fresh &amp; Easy says

    UV brings disinfection benefits to the Food and Drink Industry</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Process &amp; Control Today</font><br>
    <br>
    Despite the huge advances in cleanliness and disinfection techniques, the 
    ongoing battle against potentially dangerous micro-organisms and microbial 
    contamination in food continues. Part of the problem has been the ability of 
    microbial organisms to adapt and survive traditional chemical treatments and 
    continue to thrive, endangering the health of consumers. However 
    developments in UV technology offer a safe, non-invasive solution.<br>
    <br>
    Ultraviolet light is a natural component of sunlight. However, using higher 
    energy wavelengths of UV light has the unique ability of destroying all 
    dangerous micro-organisms. Unlike chemical disinfectants, which rely on 
    chemical oxidation to disrupt the life functions of micro-organisms, UV is 
    simply light energy that disrupts the DNA of harmful organisms. By disabling 
    their DNA the life functions of these organisms are terminated, rendering 
    them harmless. Because no chemicals are involved, consumers don’t have to 
    worry about consuming potentially harmful chemicals or their by-products.<br>
    <br>
    The food market is an increasingly regulated and safety-conscious one, 
    driven by the growing demand for even higher quality standards. Food 
    producing and packaging industries are now enjoying the unique benefits of 
    UV technology. It kills all known spoilage micro-organisms, including 
    bacteria, viruses, yeasts, protozoa and moulds (and their spores). It is a 
    low maintenance, environmentally friendly technology and as well as not 
    introducing toxins or residues into the process, it does not alter the 
    chemical composition, taste, odour or Ph of the water or liquid being 
    disinfected either.<br>
    <br>
    Whilst being designed to meet the stringent sanitary requirements of the 
    food industry, today’s UV disinfection systems can usually be easily 
    integrated in-line into process systems with little disruption to plant 
    operations. Also, the maintenance requirements are minimal – modern Amalgam 
    UV lamps only need replacing once a year.<br>
    <br>
    Malcolm Snowball, Technical Director of GB Environmental, an eminent 
    manufacturer of advanced UV treatment, believes that UV technology holds the 
    key to continued safe and effective disinfection: “Put simply, microbial 
    organisms cannot survive UV treatment. Rather than simply killing 
    micro-organisms UV actually inactivates them by disrupting their DNA, so 
    they are unable to either metabolise or reproduce. UV is also very simple to 
    apply to surfaces of products. There is no fear of chemical contamination 
    and there are no negative after-effects from the process.”<br>
    <br>
    Although the basic principal of UV sterilisation has been recognised for 
    over a century, it is the spectrum of applications and advances in 
    technology that are bringing it to the forefront today. “Advances in UV lamp 
    technology have been vital in the development of the sector,” says Malcolm. 
    “In the past energy consumption of the lamps has been an issue with some 
    providers. However, a lot of effort has been made to address these issues 
    and we at GB Environmental use reduced energy Amalgam UV lamps, which are 
    three-times more efficient than medium pressure lamps and cut down the 
    running costs significantly.<br>
    <br>
    “Our products also focus heavily on making servicing and maintenance of UV 
    equipment easier. With water cleansing, for instance, proteins within the 
    water build up on the UV lamp and need to be removed. The only way to do 
    this is to break the bond between the protein and the lamp sleeve. Our 
    Safeguard™ UV water treatment product uses eight scrapers with Titanium 
    Dioxide cleaning heads which are actually activated by the UV light and 
    become an oxidizer, removing the proteins. The process can be periodically 
    operated by users, is totally safe, non-toxic to humans and can even be used 
    in hard water areas.”<br>

    Surface disinfection is another area where UV comes into its own. Simple UV 
    tunnels can be installed on existing process lines to disinfect meat, 
    poultry or eggs prior to packaging, or before they are transferred to High 
    Care areas. Surface disinfection systems are also ideal for sterilizing food 
    handling utensils, conveyor belts and packaging materials.<br>
    <br>
    For food processors seeking to improve the quality of their product, UV is 
    an economic, realistic option for many applications. The introduction of UV 
    tunnels has also allowed a broad range of food manufacturers, from bakeries 
    to meat processors, to give food handling a high level of disinfection. It 
    is already a well established method of disinfecting drinking water 
    throughout the world, and is also widely used for high purity uses such as 
    pharmaceutical processing and semiconductor manufacturing, where water of 
    the highest quality is essential. UV is also an environmentally friendly 
    technology that allows processors to reuse wastewater, minimizing 
    discharges.<br>

    GB Environmental divisional reorganisation to target the Food and Drink 
    Industry</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Process &amp; Control Today</font><br>
    <br>
    GB Environmental, one of the world’s key manufacturers of advanced 
    ultraviolet (UV) treatment equipment, has announced a divisional 
    reorganisation of the company to focus on the Food and Drink industry. The 
    reorganisation follows on from the company’s recent acquisition of Kaiku 
    Ltd, which now joins the group as Kaiku Process Solutions to help it focus 
    on this key market sector.<br>
    <br>
    Commenting on the announcement, Sales and Marketing Director Ralph Coney, 
    says: “It makes sense to manage our business in three divisions to tackle 
    the specialist needs of different sectors. Kaiku’s expertise in product 
    monitoring for the Food and Drink Sector perfectly compliments our UV 
    capabilities providing the abilty to offer total solutions to this industry. 
    Our GB Municipal division will cater for Municipal and Industrial water 
    users. The UV Care division will continue to specialise within Healthcare, 
    the Built Environment and Leisure.”<br>
    <br>
    The Kaiku Process Solutions division, within GB Environmental, is the result 
    of the company reorganisation and the acquisition of Kaiku Ltd. This means 
    that GB Environmental can now offer Kaiku’s unique patented i-Pipe, an 
    on-line fluid monitoring system, which detects changes in the chemical 
    formulation without the need for invasive probes or manual sampling. This 
    gives benefits such as greater control of ingredients and throughput, 
    minimal downtime in the event of problems, elimination of manual errors and 
    also minimises batch waste and prevents recalls.<br>
    <br>
    The i-Pipe advanced monitoring equipment compliments GB Environmental’s 
    existing range of cutting-edge UV treatment solutions for the Food and Drink 
    industry. UV disinfection can be used in many aspects of food and drink 
    production, from the supply water to finished products, ensuring at every 
    stage that microbial contamination by bacteria, viruses, yeast and moulds is 
    kept to an absolute minimum.<br>
    <br>
    GB Environmental has an impressive portfolio of products that allows the 
    company to offer UV solutions for liquids, solids, air and water. Combined 
    with the process monitoring capability, the GB Environmental group now

    UV system to fight county pool germs</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Deseret Morning News</font><br>
    <br>
    WEST JORDAN - Salt Lake County-operated swimming pools are being equipped 
    with ultraviolet light systems to help battle the parasite cryptosporidium 
    and other bacteria that hang out in pools.<br>
    But health officials warn that technology never will replace hygiene when it 
    comes to contamination illnesses.<br>
    <br>
    Health officials and county Mayor Peter Corroon on Thursday showed off the 
    first of the new UV light systems at the Gene Fullmer Recreation Center, 
    8015 S. 2200 West. All 24 Salt Lake County Parks and Recreation pools (some 
    of the 18 county facilities have more than one) will have the UV systems, at 
    a total cost of close to $1 million.<br>
    <br>
    An outbreak of cryptosporidium along the Wasatch Front last year led to 
    temporary barring of very young swimmers from public pools and heightened 
    the rules on cleaning pools. The parasite, which lives in intestines, can be 
    spread by poor hygiene and contact with contaminated water. The resulting 
    gastrointestinal illness can be quite severe and last a week or two. More 
    than 1,900 cases were lab-confirmed last year along the Wasatch Front; 30 is 
    typical.<br>
    <br>
    UV has proven highly effective against bacteria and parasites, but it's not 
    a cure, and it's not the only tool being used to keep the water safe to swim 
    in, says Teresa Gray, bureau manager over water quality and hazardous waste 
    in the Salt Lake Valley Health Department.<br>
    <br>
    The UV lights themselves are inside canisters, and the water goes through 
    its normal filtration and then through the reaction chamber, says Lynn 
    Remund of CEM Aquatics, which installed the units, manufactured by a 
    Wisconsin company.<br>
    In two hours, about 150,000 gallons can go through one of the units to be 
    treated by the UV lights. But swimmers can be exposed to contaminants in 
    water that has not yet been treated — and they also can recontaminate water. 
    So chlorination is still needed, although in lower doses.<br>
    <br>
    There's still "some possibility of contamination," says Jim Bosserman, Salt 
    Lake County project manager. "It's not a cure-all, but it will help avoid or 
    manage an outbreak."<br>...<br>
    Pool operators, both public and private, in other cities and counties also 
    are considering the UV light systems or have installed other technological 
    options such as ozone to improve the ability to keep pools clean and safe.<br>

    EPA orders sterilization of lake's water</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">auburnpub.com/localnews</font><br>
    <br>
    SKANEATELES - Skaneateles Lake, 16 miles long and with a maximum depth of 
    more than 300 feet, has long been known for being one of the cleanest bodies 
    of water in the world. Besides serving the village of Skaneateles, the 
    glacier-carved lake provides water to the city of Syracuse, along with 
    municipalities such as Camillus and Elbridge.<br>
    <br>
    The lake's water is so pure, in fact, that the municipal water systems do 
    not filter the liquid. However, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to 
    ensure the lake's water is as clean as possible.<br>
    <br>
    As part of the guidelines for what's known as the “Long Term 2 Enhanced 
    Surface Water Treatment Rule,” which provides standards for unfiltered water 
    systems, the EPA has asked the municipalities served by Skaneateles Lake to 
    upgrade their systems.<br>
    <br>
    Despite the water's purity, EPA representatives say the water potentially 
    could contain some harmful parasites after it reaches the communities, so 
    they ordered the municipalities to implement some method of sterilization. 
    Both village and Syracuse leaders are considering installing ultraviolet 
    lamps to “zap” the harmful organisms, said John Hunt, village director of 
    municipal operations.<br>
    <br>
    “We use what's called a 'filtration avoidance system,'” he explained. 
    “That's pretty unusual in the context of water supply.”<br>
    <br>
    The lake water is chlorinated and fluoridated. Until now, that was all the 
    EPA required, Hunt said.<br>
    <br>
    “Chlorination can kill certain types of microorganisms, but there are 
    certain ones that chlorine has a very difficult time killing,” he said.<br>
    <br>
    Two potentially harmful microorganisms are cryptosporidium, which can cause 
    digestive problems in humans, and giardia lamblia, which can cause the 
    intestinal disease popularly known as “beaver fever.”<br>
    <br>
    Filtration will kill both parasites, Hunt said, but other technologies are 
    available that don't require filters.<br>
    <br>
    “The way the ultraviolet system works is, you put a bank of UV lights near 
    your chlorinate, and that kills pretty much all your bacteria,” he said.<br>
    <br>
    The UV systems, the plans for which Hunt said will be finalized in 2009, 
    will be installed atop the water tanks on East Street.<br>
    <br>
    “We'll have to cut into the infrastructure, then cut into the main pipe up 
    at that tank farm to (install) the UV treatment system,” he said.<br>
    <br>
    The completion of the system's installation, Hunt continued, depends on 
    several factors.<br><br>

    2008: Pool 
    operators hope to beat parasites with UV filtration systems</b><br>
    <font size="1">The Salt Lake Tribune</font><br>
    <br>
    LAYTON - Utah's public pools are gearing up for the summer - and taking 
    extra precautions to make sure last year's outbreak of parasites is not 
    repeated.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
    Some operators, like the Clearfield Aquatic Center, are installing 
    ultraviolet sanitation systems to guard against a parasite called 
    cryptosporidiosis. The parasite caused almost 2,000 cases of reported 
    illness last year.<br>
    <br>
    The new equipment isn't cheap - Clearfield spent more than $88,000 on its 
    system. Brigham City pool officials say UV filtration is the only way to 
    make sure water is 100 percent clear of parasites, but it still isn't a 
    perfect solution. While a pool may be clean in the morning, it could become 
    infected within an hour of opening.</p>

    Upgraded UV System with Auto Wiper Installed</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">WaterandWastewater.com</font><br>
    <br>
    Erlanger, KY -- The operators of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in 
    Richmond, BC, Canada, have opted to replace the existing low pressure UV 
    disinfection system with a high output medium pressure UV system from 
    Aquionics. The WWTP serves the Riverport Sports and Entertainment Complex 
    and surrounding residential areas in southern Richmond, near Vancouver.<br>
    <br>
    The facility decided to switch to medium pressure UV because cleaning the 
    low pressure system was very difficult. Each of the two low pressure units 
    contained 24 lamps – automatic wiping is not an option with that number of 
    lamps, so cleaning had to be done either manually or with chemicals. This is 
    an extremely time consuming process that required the entire system to be 
    shut down.<br>
    <br>
    The two Aquionics units, however, each contain just two medium pressure 
    lamps, each of which is fitted with an automatic wiper that keeps the quartz 
    sleeves clean during normal operation. There is no need to shut down the 
    system for manual or chemical cleaning and no danger of damaging the lamps 
    or exposure to wastewater.<br>
    <br>
    The Aquionics units are installed after a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) and 
    can treat a combined flow of up to 600 gallons per minute (2271 litres per 
    minute) of wastewater from the adjacent sports complex and residential 
    areas. The disinfected wastewater is discharged into the Fraser River.<br>
    <br>
    Each of the UV units is fitted with a monitor which measures actual UV 
    intensity and dose from the two lamps – providing real time information 
    which can be downloaded for record keeping. Operating the UV system is 
    simple and, when lamps need replacing, it can easily be carried out by 
    on-site staff.<br><br>

    Enva Delivers Advanced UV Technology Solution for Westmeath</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Enviroireland.com</font><br>
    <br>
    Enva has announced the completion of its largest UV project to date for the 
    supply, installation and commissioning of UV disinfection systems in part of 
    the Westmeath water supply system.<br>
    <br>
    Providing drinking water disinfection for four water treatment plants, 
    including an installation at the recently upgraded Athlone water treatment 
    plant, these systems will ultimately treat approximately 10 million litres 
    of drinking water per day. They will provide greater protection from disease 
    causing bacteria that may be present in the raw water, including 
    cryptosporidium and a range of other chlorine resistant pathogens.<br>
    <br>
    UV Technology<br>
    With UV technology, the disinfection process takes place as water flows 
    through irradiation chambers (see Panel). A photochemical effect is created 
    using UV light, and vital processes are stopped within the micro-organism 
    cells, therefore making the micro-organism harmless. The UV light 
    inactivates microbes by penetrating cell membranes to disrupt DNA molecules 
    and prevent cell replication. When a microbe cannot replicate, it is 
    incapable of damaging humans.<br>
    <br>
    “UV is widely acknowledged as a critical component in the disinfection of a 
    wide range of microbiological contaminants that can be found in drinking 
    water. It has been successfully applied across the UK and United States for 
    cryptosporidium inactivation, and research also shows that UV technology is 
    effective against all known micro-organisms, and provides a highly effective 
    solution against bacteria, algae, moulds, yeasts, viruses, cysts and 
    protozoa,” points out Finbarr Pyne, technical development Director at Enva.<br>
    <br>
    He continues: “Another key advantage of UV technology is that it also 
    destroys micro-organisms which are resistant to chlorine, while UV does not 
    form disinfection by-products which can pose health risks.”<br>
    <br>
    Enva has now supplied in excess of 100 UV units of various sizes, with 
    individual units ranging from low flow units to large flows of greater than 
    1,400m3 per hour. Units can be fully integrated with standard PLC or Scada 
    controls, and are supplied in conjunction with ATG UV technology, which has 
    over 25 years experience in the manufacture and application of UV technology 
    across a range of international clients from large blue chip organisations 
    and government controlled agencies. All units are third party bio-assay 
    validated in accordance with the 2007 US EPA guidelines for UV technology.<br>
    <br>
    Greg Duggan, Senior Engineer, Water Services at Westmeath County Council 
    advises: “‘Westmeath County Council provides quality drinking water for over 
    66,000 people throughout the county on a daily basis. The Council had to 
    deal with an outbreak of cryptospiridiosis in 2002, which greatly impacted 
    on the quality of life for one third of water consumers. In order to meet 
    the demands of the new European Communities (Drinking Water) (No.2) 
    Regulations 2007 and minimise the threat of a micro-biological contamination 
    to its water sources, Westmeath County Council has introduced innovative 
    technology and work procedures as a highly effective solution to a complex 
    risk.”<br>
    <br>
    Key Support Services<br>
    Highlighting the key supports services offered by Enva, Finbarr Pyne adds: 
    “As well as supplying and installing UV technology, Enva also offer the 
    reassurance of a full and immediate after-sales service back-up. We offer 
    full maintenance contracts by fully trained service engineers. We also 
    provide a 24 hour callout service as part of our maintenance contract, while 
    our facility in Cork carries a full range of back-up equipment.”<br>
    <br>
    Enva Ireland specialises in providing innovative, efficient and 
    cost-effective solutions for the treatment and disposal of a diverse range 
    of wastes. The company is structured into seven divisions, with each 
    division focusing on a certain business area and having its own identity 
    within Enva. These divisions include Hazardous Waste, Water Treatment, Soil 
    Treatment, Industrial &amp; Automotive, Field Services, Underground Services and 
    Foodservice Solutions. It operates four licensed facilities in the Republic 
    of Ireland (Portlaoise, Shannon, Cork and Dublin) and two in Northern 
    Ireland (Drumaness and Carryduff). It also has a Water Treatment operation 
    based in Runcorn in the UK.<br>
    <br>
    It operates high tech laboratories, at its Portlaoise, Shannon and Cork 
    facilities, which focus on developing innovative treatment processes 
    focusing primarily on recovery rather than disposal. According to Enva. It 
    is currently the only environmental solutions company within Ireland to 
    offer this level of specialised technical expertise combined with the 
    infrastructure to deliver this service.<br>

    UV disinfection in meat processing</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Processingtalk.com</font><br>
    <br>
    Hanovia UV disinfection systems can improve safety standards and increase 
    product shelf life in the meat processing industry. The compact systems are 
    easily incorporated into many meat processing applications including wash 
    water, brine chillers, meat marinade and pickle injectors and also for 
    disinfecting wastewater for re-use. Disinfecting the water used to rinse 
    carcasses and to wash process equipment and work surfaces can dramatically 
    decrease contamination, increasing shelf life.<br>
    <br>
    UV also reduces the amount of chlorine needed to disinfect rinse and wash 
    water.<br>
    <br>
    UV systems on recirculating brine chillers and meat pickle and marinade 
    injectors are very effective at destroying harmful micro-organisms like 
    Listeria and E.coli.<br>
    <br>
    Depending on the model, some UV systems can operate very effectively through 
    a wide range of temperatures and applications - from super-cooled brines to 
    very hot sanitation cycles.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, in marinade applications, operating costs are reduced through 
    less frequent fluid change-over.<br>
    <br>
    The other application for UV in meat processing operations is as a 
    non-chemical treatment for plant wastewater.<br>
    <br>
    Increasingly, meat processors are caught between conflicting sets of 
    regulations - while food hygiene regulations in many countries require 
    increased use of water to rinse carcasses, environmental regulations are 
    limiting the amount of fresh water that a plant can consume.<br>
    <br>
    With only so much fresh water coming in, plants are forced to reduce 
    capacity in order to meet these conflicting requirements.<br>
    <br>
    By re-using disinfected wastewater in non-contact applications like chillers 
    and cooling towers, more fresh water can be devoted to washing and 
    processing.<br>
    <br>
    Hanovia UV systems can be used in conjunction with other waste treatment 
    processes to disinfect wastewater without chemicals, making it fit to use 
    again.<br>
    <br>
    By using this low-maintenance technology, plant production capacity can be 
    increased and hazardous chemicals are eliminated.<br>
    <br>
    Designed to meet the stringent sanitary requirements of the food industry, 
    all Hanovia UV units can be easily integrated into plant control systems.<br>
    <br>
    Maintenance requirements are minimal - typically the UV lamps only need 
    replacing once a year, an easy operation which can be carried out by on-site 
    personnel.<br>
    <br>
    Automatic internal wipers keep the UV lamps clean, ensuring optimum UV 
    output at all times - especially important in solutions with a high 
    concentration of suspended solids.<br>
    <br>
    Based in the United Kingdom, Hanovia is a world leader in UV disinfection 
    technology for processing applications.<br>
    <br>
    The company has over 80 years experience in the design, development, 
    manufacture and distribution of UV systems worldwide.<br><br>

    Closed vessel, medium pressure UV available in UK</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Processingtalk.com</font><br>
    <br>
    After tremendous worldwide success of large, closed vessel medium pressure 
    UV disinfection systems in municipal water and wastewater applications, 
    Berson UV-techniek now offers them in the UK. Berson, a Halma company based 
    in the Netherlands, will be building on the reputation of its British sister 
    company Hanovia, and using the Hanovia extensive service support network. 
    Berson medium pressure InLine systems are especially designed to provide 
    closed vessel disinfection of both drinking water and wastewater at very 
    high volumes and flow rates.<br>
    <br>
    Berson is the only manufacturer of medium pressure UV water disinfection 
    systems to be certified to the stringent German DVGW Standard, W294 (Parts 
    1, 2 and 3) - the highest standard currently possible in the world.<br>
    <br>
    Major advantages of closed vessel, medium pressure UV compared to open 
    channel, low pressure UV systems include a much smaller footprint, 
    automated, mechanical cleaning of the UV lamps, and permanent de-activation 
    of micro-organisms.<br>
    <br>
    Conventional low pressure open channel UV wastewater systems often need 
    large treatment channels and many numbers of UV lamps, taking up valuable 
    space that could be used for other purposes.<br>
    <br>
    Berson closed vessel, InLine medium pressure systems, on the other hand, 
    have a very small footprint and can easily be integrated into existing 
    pipework with minimal disruption: they are already widely used in Germany, 
    France, Scandinavia, the USA and Australia.<br>
    <br>
    Keeping all the UV lamps clean in open channel, low pressure systems is also 
    a difficult task and usually requires chemical dosing, a costly and 
    time-consuming process which produces unwanted waste products which have to 
    be dealt with effectively.<br>
    <br>
    Closed vessel systems, on the other hand, use in-built automatic wipers 
    which manually clean the quartz sleeves surrounding the UV lamps, doing away 
    with the need for chemical cleaning.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, microbial re-growth, known as photo-reactivation, has been shown to 
    occur when micro-organisms such as E.coli are treated with low pressure UV 
    and subsequently exposed to sunlight, as is the case with open channel, low 
    pressure UV systems.<br>
    <br>
    This does not happen with closed vessel medium pressure UV systems.<br>
    <br>
    'We are delighted to be moving into the UK municipal water and wastewater 
    market,' commented Sjors van Gaalen, Berson managing director: 'Our UV 
    technology is well established on the European continent and in the USA and 
    Australia, but relatively unknown in the UK.<br>
    <br>
    We strongly believe that our unique offering of closed-vessel, medium 
    pressure UV technology will prove just as successful here as it has done 
    around the world'.<br>
    <br>
    Berson, along with fellow UV companies Hanovia in the UK and Aquionics in 
    the USA, is part of the Fluid Technology Division of Halma plc.<br>
    <br>
    Together, the three companies make up one of the largest suppliers of UV 
    disinfection technology in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>

    UV Disinfection Reduces Byproducts</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">WaterandWastewater.com</font><br>
    <br>
    Erlanger, KY - It is now nearly three years since Poughkeepsies' Water 
    Treatment Facility in New York state installed six Aquionics UV disinfection 
    systems for drinking water treatment. In that time the closed chamber, 
    medium pressure systems have been performing beyond expectations.<br>
    <br>
    "We get approximately 5,000 hours of lamp life per UV system, but a few 
    lamps have run for as long as 11,000 hours, which is excellent" commented 
    Paul Lill, the facility's plant manager. "This means we only have to change 
    the lamps about once a year while also reducing our running costs - always 
    an important consideration."<br>
    <br>
    Poughkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility serves a community of nearly 80,000, 
    drawing water from the Hudson River to meet an average daily demand of 
    10.5MGD. Prior to installing the Aquionics equipment in March of 2005, 
    chlorination was used in open settling basins, followed by filtration. This 
    process required substantial chemical usage and produced significant 
    disinfection byproducts.<br>
    <br>
    With the addition of the Aquionics UV treatment equipment the amount of 
    chlorine required for primary disinfection was significantly reduced, with a 
    corresponding lowering of disinfection byproducts by up to 20%. Secondary, 
    residual disinfection is provided by chloramines. The resulting disinfection 
    levels complied with the new guidelines of the Surface Water Treatment Rule 
    issued by the EPA.<br>
    <br>
    The six Aquionics UV systems are situated downstream of the filters and 
    operate in parallel. The medium pressure, closed channel design disinfects 
    with far fewer lamps and with a much smaller footprint than comparable low 
    pressure systems. Each chamber is fitted with UV monitors to measure actual 
    UV fluence and dose for record keeping. With the addition of an optional 
    online transmittance monitor, real time transmittance values are used to 
    automatically adjust the dose pacing of the UV system.<br>
    <br>
    "We originally considered alternative disinfection technologies to meet our 
    goals," explained Lill. "The units' lower relative cost, their compact size 
    which fits into our existing facility and the technical merit were all 
    deciding factors in choosing Aquionics equipment." <br>
    <br>
    To keep maintenance low, the systems are equipped with automatic cleaning 
    mechanisms which keep the UV lamp sleeves free of organic deposits. When the 
    lamps need replacing, it is a simple operation that is carried out by 
    on-site staff.<br><br>

    SANYO Provides Patented SafeCell UV Technology to Solve Contamination 
    Problems</b><br>
    <font size="1">EMAILWIRE.COM</font><br>
    <br>
    SANYO BIOMEDICAL SOLUTIONS, A division of SANYO Commercial Solutions 
    provides patented SafeCell UV technology to solve contamination problems 
    that occur in cell culture incubators<br>
    <br>
    The CO2 incubator remains an essential tool for research and clinical 
    laboratory work by directly exposing cell cultures and culture media to an 
    enriched environment for growth.<br>
    <br>
    Manufacturers of laboratory incubators claim to solve contamination problems 
    with various approaches to incubator design through heat sterilization. Some 
    of these techniques are moderately successful but limited in terms of 
    long-term efficacy and convenience. Most require periods of downtime during 
    which cultures must be removed and placed in other incubators to maintain 
    temperature, humidity and CO2 levels. The problem with this is that all cell 
    cultures, CO2 sensor, HEPA filters and other components must be removed 
    prior to the process, effectively suspending the productivity of the 
    incubator often in excess of 24 hours. It is an inefficient use of time and 
    lab resources.<br>
    <br>
    SANYO’S solution to this problem is patented UV technology. “In 2001 SANYO 
    Electric Biomedical Co., Ltd. introduced a cell culture CO2 incubator that 
    employs an isolated narrow-bandwidth ultraviolet (UV) light decontamination 
    to destroy airborne contaminants in the incubator chamber, as well as 
    water-borne organisms in the humidity water reservoir. Integrated with 
    copper enriched interior surfaces and components which inhibit the growth of 
    organisms without surface discoloration, the SANYO incubator offers an 
    optimum cell culture environment through a process of Active Background 
    Contamination Control™ which protects cultures in vitro, and minimizes 
    frequent chamber cleaning and downtime,” exert from A Comparative Analysis 
    of Ultraviolet Light Decontamination vs. High Heat Sterilization in the Cell 
    Culture CO2 Incubator, with the Use of Copper-Enriched Stainless Steel 
    Construction to Achieve Active Background Contamination Control whitepaper. 
    A directional air-flow and containment plenum surrounds the UV exposed 
    humidity reservoir in a removable, stainless steel pan. It is designed to 
    independently destroy airborne particles during door openings, as well as 
    contaminants that typically grow in the water reservoir. Because the UV lamp 
    is visibly isolated from the cell culture chamber by a plenum cover, UV 
    sterilization of air and water remains in process while cell culture 
    continues uninterrupted. <br>
    <br>
    In 2006, comparative testing commissioned by SANYO and performed by a 
    certified independent testing laboratory confirms that the SANYO ultraviolet 
    light sterilization process is as effective against bacteria, yeasts and 
    molds as high heat sterilization at sustained temperatures ranging from 
    +90°C to +140°C offered in competitive products. Additionally, the latest 
    SANYO release, Model MCO-18AIC-UV, maintains an optimum cell culture 
    environment in vitro through a process of "Active Background Contamination 
    Control,” which a heat sterilization technique absolutely cannot replicate.</p>

    Detroit Lakes Community Pool Gets Ultraviolet Fix - Air Quality Was a 
    Problem for Some Swimmers</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Pippi Mayfield DL-Online</font><br>
    <br>
    Several years ago, the Detroit Lakes Community and Cultural Center staff 
    noticed the bricks on the outside of the building by the pool were turning 
    white. After investigating, they found moisture from the inside was being 
    forced outside.<br>
    <br>
    “It obviously concerned us as to what’s going on,” CEO Stu Omberg said. <br>
    <br>
    They found the problem wasn’t the pool but rather the air. In the world of 
    pools, air pressure should be tested at negative. The DLCCC’s was positive.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are two different ways to treat pools — chlorine, which the DLCCC 
    uses, and bromine, which is extremely expensive.<br>
    <br>
    “The vast majority of commercial pools use chlorine,” Omberg said.<br>
    <br>
    Chlorine is used to burn the bacteria in the pool. The downside of chlorine 
    is that it degrades and turns into chloramines, which are lifted into the 
    air and can cause respiratory problems for some people.<br>
    <br>
    Tracy Boldt of rural Frazee said her 10-year-old daughter was one of those 
    people.<br>
    <br>
    “She would ingest the gas Monday and by Thursday she’s having a severe 
    migraine headache,” Boldt said. “By the weekend she was fine, detoxifying, 
    you could say.”<br>
    <br>
    An avid swimmer who formerly swam for the DL Sunfish, and now swims for an 
    independent group, the girl suffered symptoms that included painful 
    headaches, respiratory problems, vomiting and even passing out and 
    hallucinations.<br>
    <br>
    “She said the floor levitated up at her in the shower,” said Boldt, who is a 
    registered nurse. The girl was taken to a doctor and a chiropractor, but the 
    symptoms didn’t go away until she quit using the community center pool.<br>
    <br>
    “We eventually realized it was the pool, and that took care of it. She’s 
    fine now,” Boldt said. “She swam at the indoor pool at Perham all summer and 
    she swims at the Detroit Lakes High School pool now. She’s got no problems.”<br>
    <br>
    It’s the chloramines that have been causing the problems at the DLCCC. 
    Omberg said staff checks the chlorine levels in the pool twice a day to make 
    sure they are within state health department guidelines, which they always 
    have been. <br>
    <br>
    “Pool water wasn’t the issue,” he said.<br>
    <br>
    The Minnesota Department of Health cannot test air quality, he said, but 
    when it tested the water quality, the DLCCC always passed the test. <br>
    <br>
    As the chloramines formed and the pool would fill with more people, with the 
    splashing, the chloramines would lift into the air and attach to objects in 
    the room, causing items to rust.<br>
    <br>
    Also, Omberg pointed out, chlorine is odorless, so it was the chloramines 
    people could smell when walking into the pool area.<br>
    <br>
    So, to solve the problem of the chloramines, the DLCCC received a $53,700 
    loan from the Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corp., the developers 
    of the community center, to install an ultraviolet system to treat the water 
    before it goes into the pool.<br>
    <br>
    The system was installed in the pool at the end of last week and will be in 
    the spa within the next 45 days.<br>
    <br>
    Eight hundred gallons of water per minute are fed into the pool, and now 
    that water will run through the ultraviolet system before hitting the pool. 
    It will help kill the chloramines.<br>
    <br>
    The water will be sanitized as it comes into the pool so the “chlorine 
    doesn’t have to work as hard,” he said. It will eliminate the chloramines, 
    and the air quality will improve within three days.<br>
    <br>
    “This is state of the art, leading edge technology to treat water before 
    it’s in the pool or spa,” he said. <br>
    <br>
    With the installation of the system being the first step in the process, 
    Omberg said various crews will be in and out throughout the next three to 
    four months working to alleviate the air pressure problems in the pool. <br>
    <br>
    He said he is “ecstatic” the DLCCC can provide the ultraviolet treatment 
    system and that swimmers are excited because they know the benefit the 
    system has on water and air quality.<br><br>

    World to Focus on Improved Sanitation in 2008</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">ENS-Newswire.com</font><br>
    <br>
    NEW YORK, New York, January 2, 2008 (ENS) - A wastewater treatment project 
    in the Russian city of Ufa is reducing the amount of raw sewage that flows 
    into the Volga River basin. The project is part of a global push to improve 
    sanitation this year - the International Year of Sanitation 2008. <br>
    <br>
    Now, the municipal water utility UfaVodocanal is seeking to finish the work 
    while at the same time reducing the environmental impact of the wastewater 
    treatment process. <br>
    <br>
    With this goal in mind, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
    Development, EBRD, has agreed to lend the utility 500 million roubles (US 
    $20.4 million) over the next 13 years so that it can invest in cleaner and 
    more energy efficient technology.<br>
    <br>
    The loan will enable UfaVodocanal to treat sewage with ultraviolet 
    disinfection technology and purchase methane tanks. These tanks will capture 
    biological gas from the sewage and the gas will be burned off to produce 
    heat for UfaVodocanal's own use. <br>
    <br>
    "The ultraviolet technology will enable the utility to significantly reduce 
    the levels of untreated sewage discharged into the Belaya River," 
    UfaVodocanal Director Viacheslav Semenovich Gordienko. <br>
    <br>
    "This project will give a boost to the economy of the city and is key in 
    improving environmental standards," said Ufa Mayor Pavel Rurikovich Kachkaev.<br>
    <br>
    ...</p>

	<p>The International Year of Sanitation 2008 was established by the UN 
    General Assembly in December 2006 to accelerate progress towards meeting the 
    Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half the proportion of people 
    living without access to improved sanitation by 2015. <br>
    <br>
    A World Health Organization, report issued Tuesday finds that while coverage 
    has been advancing in many countries, recent estimates consistently show the 
    sanitation component of the MDG sanitation target to be off-track, with "a 
    projected shortfall of 550 million people in 2015 from target achievement."
    <br>
    <br>
    The estimated total spending, excluding program costs, required in 
    developing countries to meet the sanitation component of the MDG target is 
    US$ 142 billion, the World Health Organization report calculates. This 
    translates to per-capita spending of US$ 28 for sanitation. <br>
    <br>
    Annually, this translates to roughly US$ 4 billion for water supply and US$ 
    14 for sanitation, an annual combined total of US$ 18 billion. <br>
    <br>
    Their results compare with previous estimates of the annual investment costs 
    of increasing coverage to meet the water and sanitation MDG target, which 
    have been variously estimated at US$ 9 billion, US$ 11.3 billion, US$ 18 
    billion and US$ 30 billion. <br>
    <br>
    "Given the lack of up-to-date data on actual combined spending by 
    governments and households on water supply and sanitation in developing 
    countries, it is not possible to estimate the current financing gap at the 
    global level," according to authors Guy Hutton of the World Bank's Water and 
    Sanitation Program in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Jamie Bartram of the World 
    Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. <br>
    <br>
    Improved sanitation includes clean, safe toilets, wastewater management and 
    hygiene promotion, all of which prevent the transfer of pathogens in human 
    waste. When not treated safely, this waste adversely impacts health and 
    impedes social and economic development. <br>
    <br>
    The International Year of Sanitation will include major regional conferences 
    on sanitation to share best practices and help accelerate progress, 
    including those that focus on school sanitation. <br>
    <br>
    It will also help encourage public and private partnerships, to help tap 
    into the comparative strengths of each sector, advocate and raise awareness 
    on sanitation, leverage additional funding, and develop country-level plans 
    of action. <br>
    <br>
    Many activities and events are planned both inside and outside the United 
    Nations for Sanitation and Hygiene Week March 15 to 21 and World Water Day 
    on March 22.<br><br>

    Halo Technologies Introduces The World's Only Germ-Killing Vacuum</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">PRNewswire</font><br>
    <br>
    The Halo™ UV-ST Ultraviolet Vacuum Uses Ultraviolet Light and HEPA 
    Filtration to Attack Unseen Household Microbes Without Harsh Chemicals<br>
    <br>
    CHARLOTTE, NC — The Halo UV-ST is a new chemical-free vacuum — the only one 
    of its kind — that combines powerful pick-up and ultraviolet technology to 
    clean dirt and kill germs that lurk and thrive in carpets, including dust 
    mites, molds, viruses and bacteria, even MRSA.<br>
    <br>
    Carpets — which are rarely, if ever, disinfected — cover more than 70 
    percent of floor space in homes and contain the highest concentration of 
    invisible germs and allergens. A typical carpet harbors more than 100,000 
    dust mites per square yard; these dust mites are the number one indoor cause 
    of allergies. Ultraviolet light in the "C" spectrum (UV-C) disables the DNA 
    of these household pests, destroying their ability to multiply. The Halo 
    UV-ST contains a UV-C bulb chamber at the bottom of the unit. Activating the 
    ultraviolet technology while running the vacuum over carpets, instantly 
    kills germs living between the fibers. <br>
    <br>
    Ultraviolet light technology has been used for more than 60 years to purify 
    drinking water and sterilize operating rooms and medical instruments. 
    Independent researchers have tested and proven the efficacy of the 
    germ-killing benefits in the Halo UV-ST. <br>
    <br>
    "The Halo UV-ST is more than a high-performing traditional vacuum cleaner; 
    it's the next generation in home cleaning. We've all disinfected other areas 
    of our home for years. Now our Halo Ultraviolet Vacuums allow you to achieve 
    that same level of clean in your carpeting without any extra effort and 
    without using any harmful chemicals," said Ken Garcia, CEO of Halo 
    Technologies, Inc. "This product will change the lives of allergy and asthma 
    sufferers, parents with young children, pet owners and anyone that wants a 
    cleaner, greener home."<br>
    <br>
    The Halo HEPA filter provides the highest level of air filtration available 
    and is comparable to the quality level used by the military in fighter 
    planes. The new soft-top model is equipped with special features that 
    optimize the vacuum's breakthrough technology, including: versatile 
    attachments for easy access to hard-to-reach places, an extra-long 31-foot 
    power cord, and a height adjuster to accommodate various surfaces, including 
    tile and wood. The UV-ST has a 14-inch cleaning path and two powerful 
    motors, yet it only weighs 16.8 pounds.<br><br>

    Ozone Generating Lamps Eliminate Odours in Finnish, Santa Theme Park<br>
    <br>
    Every year in the time running up to Christmas, Santa is visited by many 
    children and their parents in the Santa Park theme park close to the Arctic 
    Circle in Lapland/Finland. Santa Park is housed in a mountain and, in a 
    large central hall, the visitors are entertained by a number of activities. 
    For example, elves learn in a school how to prepare and pack the children’s 
    presents; in an ice gallery, visitors can marvel at many animals sculpted in 
    ice; and, being Finland, there is naturally an ice bar, where cocktails can 
    be enjoyed in ice glasses at the bar on an imaginary beach.<br>
    <br>
    The Santa Park is open only once a year during advent. During the rest of 
    the year the site is shut. Consequently, moulds are formed as well as 
    associated unpleasant smells and these are controlled by means of UV lamps 
    from Heraeus Noblelight.<br>
    <br>
    The physical method UV radiation is an economical and environmentally 
    friendly alternative to chemical treatments. By using special Heraeus UV 
    lamps ozone is generated from the oxygen in the environmental air. To do 
    this, the emitted wavelength of 185nm is used. The longer wavelength of 254 
    nm photolysis the ozone to excited oxygen, which oxidises the long chain 
    molecules.<br>
    <br>
    The company BonAir manufactures and sells ozone-generating equipment in 
    Finland and this equipment is fitted out with UV lamps from Heraeus 
    Noblelight. The systems are fitted with four ozone-generating, U-shaped 120 
    Watt lamps. The capacity of the large BonAir Ozonator allows the generation 
    of 64 grammes of ozone per hour.<br>
    <br>
    This system has been used to treat the 35,000 cubic metres of air in the 
    tunnel system and the main hall at Santa Park, which has been treated two 
    and half days. In addition, three smaller pieces of equipment are also used 
    with a capacity of 3.2 gramme of ozone per hour. Finally, 300 metre long 
    channels of the air conditioning system were supplied with ozone-containing 
    air for six hours.<br>
    <br>
    “The end result was fantastic. I destroyed all the mould and at the end 
    there was no trace of the previous bad smells!” commented Raimo Vartiainen, 
    managing director of BonAir in Finland. When the project was finished, Santa 
    himself thanked Raimo Vartiainen and his wife personally.<br>
    <br>
    Following on from the development of UV lamp technology by Richard Küch in 
    1904, Heraeus Noblelight can look back on over 100 years experience in the 
    development, production and application of UV lamps. Through innovations 
    such as Longlife technology Heraeus continues to set milestones in lamp 
    technology to increase the productivity of industrial processes. Heraeus 
    Noblelight is the original equipment manufacturer and preferred partner of 
    system builders providing equipment for the disinfection of water, air and 
    surfaces, as well as for industrial photochemical processes and oxidation.<br><br>

    Alternatives to the bottled water</b><br>
    <font size="1">LatinAmericaPress.org</font><br>
    <br>
    In 2006, bottled water sales worldwide totaled 164 billion liters, 7 percent 
    of which was sold in Latin America, and half of that in Mexico.<br>
    <br>
    One alternative to bottled water is solar water disinfection, a clean and 
    cheap technology used to disinfect water in the home, created by Lebanese 
    scientist Aftim Acra. The treatment consists of filling transparent plastic 
    water bottles and leaving them out in the sun.<br>
    <br>
    The heat and <b>ultraviolet rays disinfect the water</b> in six hours of 
    sunlight or two full days under cloud cover, after which the water is safe 
    for consumption.<br>
    <br>
    The SODIS Foundation, named after the initials for this technology and based 
    in Cochabamba, Bolivia, is promoting this system also in Ecuador, El 
    Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru.</p>

  <img border="0" src="../images/uv-surgery.jpg" alt="UV Disinfection of Operating Rooms (OR) Infection Control" align="right" hspace="10" width="300" height="198">Background:</b> Ultraviolet lighting is an alternative to laminar airflow in 

  the operating room that may be as effective for lowering the number of 

  environmental bacteria and possibly lowering infection rates by killing the 

  bacteria rather than simply reducing the number at the operative site. The 

  purpose of the present study was to compare the infection rates following 

  joint replacement procedures performed by one orthopaedic surgeon with and 

  without the use of ultraviolet lighting.</p>

  <p><b>Methods:</b> From July 1986 to July 2005, one surgeon performed 5,980 total joint 

  replacements at one facility. In September 1991, ultraviolet lighting was 

  installed in the operating rooms. All procedures that were performed before 

  the installation of the ultraviolet lighting utilized horizontal laminar 

  airflow, whereas all procedures that were performed after that date utilized 

  ultraviolet lighting without laminar airflow. Factors associated with the rate 

  of infection were analyzed. <br>

  <br>

  <b>Results:</b> Over a nineteen-year period, forty-seven infections occurred 

  following 5,980 joint replacements. The infection rate without ultraviolet 

  lighting (and with laminar airflow) was 1.77%, and the infection rate with 

  ultraviolet lighting was 0.57% (p &lt; 0.0001). The odds of infection were 3.1 

  times greater for procedures performed without ultraviolet lighting (and with 

  laminar airflow) as compared with those performed with only ultraviolet 

  lighting (p &lt; 0.0001). The infection rate associated with total hip 

  replacement decreased from 1.03% to 0.72% (p = 0.5407), and the infection rate 

  associated with total knee replacement decreased from 2.20% to 0.50% (p &lt; 

  0.0001). Revision surgery, previous infection, age, total body mass index, use 

  of cement, disease, and diagnosis were not associated with an elevated 

  infection rate. <br>

  <br>

  <b>Conclusion:</b> When appropriate safety precautions are taken, ultraviolet 

  lighting appears to be an effective way to lower the risk of infection in the 

  operating room during total joint replacement surgery. <br>

  <br>

  <b>Level of Evidence:</b> Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions to Authors for a 

  complete description of levels of evidence.</p>
