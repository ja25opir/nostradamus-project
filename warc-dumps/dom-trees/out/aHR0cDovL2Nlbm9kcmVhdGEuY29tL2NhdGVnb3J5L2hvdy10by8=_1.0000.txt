			<p>Lately, more and more city people have taken to raising their own chickens. Certainly, the benefits are quite obvious as these incredible birds provide us with organic eggs and food. Of course, in order to go about this, you have to choose your chicken coop plans carefully to ensure their well-being and then some.</p>
<p>For someone who wants to save money and have these fresh eggs, purchasing a pre-built coop is often out of the question, due to its high cost. So that would leave you with building your own. But don’t be discouraged, because it really is easy to do when you have step-by-step instructions that you can follow.</p>
<p>The best part is, this is all possible regardless of how handy you are. And it can all be done at a relatively inexpensive cost. So, if you have dreamed of raising and owning your own chickens, you can now go ahead and do it, even if you have a smaller budget.</p>
<p>With regards to the tools that are necessary, most people already own the hand tools that will be required. As for the materials, they can be found pretty much at any local hardware store. So it’s convenient as well.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a commitment involved because you will have to take care of your birds. Since we all have other responsibilities, these designs are specifically made for the urban farmer. This way, it makes it easy to take care of the fowl but also to easily retrieve the eggs.</p>
<p>The design is in keeping with urban living, so there is no fear of something aesthetically unappealing in your backyard. In other words, they can be interesting and attractive.</p>
<p>Many people are choosing a healthier lifestyle which requires eating organic produce. The benefits are obvious. Additionally, people are also looking for ways in which they can live more eco-friendly. One way to do that is with owning their own chickens and it is a growing trend that you too can now get in on.</p>

			<p>Cigars, much to their credit, can burn a long while. The idea of having a long, relaxing smoke is one of their principal selling points and, where truly high-end cigars are concerned, smokers are often willing to pay quite a premium for that experience! There will come a time, however, when one won’t be able to finish their entire cigar without interruption and many smokers wonder if it’s okay to relight a cigar or if the whole thing is ruined if put out before it’s finished. The good news is that a cigar can be relit, though with some change of flavor.</p>
<p>After extinguishing the cigar, many smokers blow through it to get rid of any smoke that may remain in the wrapper. This can lessen the buildup of tar. That buildup is principally what will change the taste of the cigar on the second lighting and it’s unavoidable that this will happen to some degree. Simply drawing smoke through the cigar causes this.</p>
<p>The tobacco in the center of the cigar will likely have a different appearance than that around the edges. In most cases, it will be a bit darker. This is nothing to worry about and the cigar will smoke fine. The lighting process for relighting a cigar is identical to the first light, involving turning the cigar over the flame. Torch lighters, liquid-fuel lighters or butane lighters will work fine, there is nothing at all that differs in the lighting process.</p>
<p>If the cigar is trimmed back, there will likely be some darkening of the tobacco, particularly in the center of the cigar where the smoke tends to be drawn through the most. This is nothing to worry about and the tobacco will still taste good. In fact, some smokers actually prefer this taste as it has a bit more “bite” to it and offers a different smoking experience.</p>
<p>Relight the cigar just as one would light a fresh cigar. The first puff may taste a bit strong but the taste will generally become mellower as one continues smoking. By the time the cigar is burning nice and hot, there should be little appreciable difference in the taste. Good cigars are priced in a way that makes throwing half of one away a total waste. Relighting a half-smoked cigar is sensible in terms of money and, of course, taste!</p>

			<p>Many cigar enthusiasts are quite surprised when they go to check on a batch of cigars only to find that mold has somehow managed to enter the humidor and accumulate on the trays or the cigars themselves. This leads to the question “what causes mold in a humidor?” and the answer is a bit tricky. This is because there are actually a few valid reasons that mold might appear.</p>
<p>The main reason that mold will appear on the inside of a humidor is the existence of too much humidity. Just having a level above 75% is not instantly going to create a widespread problem, and the real trouble tends to come from the moisture being kept to a smaller area within the entire container. For example, a tray full of cigars might be blocking the top of the humidifier which causes the moisture to soak into the tray, and then the cigars. This leads to a remarkably high level of humidity and the quick development of mold.</p>
<p>The first common problem is the water inside of the box. More often than not this water is managed by a humidifier. The humidifier can be attached to any area of the interior of the box, but it can also often become blocked by too many cigars or by a tray without any slats for aeration. This leads to an over accumulation of water in a single area, which could mean that cigars are soaking wet or that the wood of the trays is saturated. This will then lead to mold, especially if the box is not opened on a regular basis.</p>
<p>If water is not the culprit, it is usually bacteria on the trays or the cigars themselves. Like many other activities in life, it is best to thoroughly wash the hands before opening and handling cigars. If not, the oils, bacteria, or even the dirt and food residue which cannot be seen by the eye can find a home on the surface of the object and then begin to thrive in the dark, warm and moist conditions of the humidor.</p>
<p>If mold does appear it is important to remove the cigars (treating moldy ones according to an approved method) and to properly disinfect the entire interior surface with Isopropyl Alcohol in order to kill off any residual spores.</p>

			<p>The economy is suffering, and yet, Americans still refuse to hold off on spending until they can buy and choose instead to take on more and more debt. This raises some interesting issues for the collection industry. For collection companies, business is booming. There is more debt than ever, just waiting to be collected.</p>
<p>Yet carrying through on their job to collect that debt is proving to be harder for debt collection agencies than it ever was before. Either people simply do not have the money to pay back their debt, or the money they do have is to cover their bare essentials: food, shelter, and a car. The local creditor isn’t going to come in and take the average debtor’s house, so creditors are being placed on the back burners for now.</p>
<p>Management in the collection field should try to remember three ideas that I write about in this three part series. The first idea is to network, stay “teched up” and always search for ways to improve the current debt collection team. The second idea is to improve the relationships that they have with their debtors, and the third idea is that management needs to remember to be nice to their star employees.</p>
<p>In the business environment, connections are crucial, and isn’t the internet just one World Wide Web of potential connections? Get online and do that networking. Talk to other collection agencies, creditors that you could potentially do business with, and while you are on the computer, always be on the lookout for the next big trend. Some debt collectors are considering texting debtors to let them know that their account is being sent to collections.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion (but hey, what do I know? I simply get paid to write about this for hours a week) the collections industry should attempt to get the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act updated. The thing was written in the 1970s, is outdated and therefore doesn’t account for cell phones. Many debt collection agencies realize that younger people would rather make payments online and have set up systems to do just that, which is a great idea. Since the economy has gotten so rotten, older people have gone in to debt as well, and accommodations should be made for them too, making it easier for them to pay. If you want a debtor to pay, make it easier for them to do so. It’s as easy as that. To Be Continued In Parts Two And Three</p>

			<p>In the middle of an American economic crisis, and every other industry seems to be cutting back, one seems to be growing rapidly: the debt collection! You heard right! According to one recent study that was conducted as of late, more than fifty five percent of the collection agencies questioned plan to add to the amount of staff that they already employ this fiscal year.</p>
<p>Any manager going through the hiring process is aware of the time and aggravation that comes with finding the right fit for the job, especially a job like a debt collector where attention to detail and motivation are highly necessary. In the collections industry, it is imperative that you hire the right person. A debt collector who is too laid back is not going to collect; a collector who is too high strung might end up getting your company sued. Hiring the wrong person not only leads to an unhappy new hire with the ability to harm the credibility of the hiring manager and even the company, but it also wastes management time that it takes to train. Time and money that could have been put into training the right employee in the first place.</p>
<p>So how should a hiring manager go about conducting interviews to find the best fit? Interviewing styles will vary from business to business. Generally, a number of interviews will involve asking about a candidate’s job history. But if a candidate has an idea of what you are looking for, and they are good at selling you their experience, you may wind up hiring the person who is not best suited for the specific job you have in mind. Thus, the most crucial idea that any potential employer should keep in mind during an interview is to get the candidate to be extremely specific. Studies have shown that it is more effective to go over less material very thoroughly than to have a general sense of everywhere that the candidate has been. It is important not to simply accept their first answer as complete- probe for more details.</p>
<p>In the collection industry, behavioral questions have been proven to be helpful. These are based on the idea that past actions may predict behavior in the future. When it is important that you need to be able to reasonably predict how a new hire will react to any sort of stimulus on the job because the credibility of your agency is at stake, questions such as “give me an example of,” or “what are your best and worst personality traits” can be helpful. Ask the candidate how they generally handle stress. You and I know they are going to be dealing with it after all.</p>
<p>Finally, look for new hires who feel passion about the things that they do. Try to look under the surface to determine if there is an authentic depth underneath what the candidate is claiming. Try asking about hobbies, life goals, etc. It may be unorthodox, but looking beyond qualifications can help you get a hold of some of the details that will give you an idea of how a candidate will approach a job and what their work habits are like.</p>

			<p>In parts one and two in this set of articles on the very basics of debt collection, I spoke about the differences between an in house collector and a third party collection agent. I let you know about the different types of ways that debt collectors will locate the debtors, and described a number of statements that the debt collector must say before they can proceed in their attempt to collect debt from you.</p>
<p>Collection agents call these legal guidelines a “mini Miranda.” If a collections agent does not give this information to you, he or she is violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If questioned, the debt collector is obligated to tell you her name, the name, address and fax number of her agency, and what creditor she is calling on behalf of.</p>
<p>If it is necessary the collections agent will go over the terms of sale with you, or credit contracts. Keep in mind that your conversation will most likely be recorded, and a good collection agent is a sneaky one. They will probably utilize their listening skills to attempt to determine the cause of the delinquency.</p>
<p>Even though you may have heard some incredible anecdotal stories, or you may have read sensational stories in the news, most debt collectors are empathetic people, working to make a buck like you. Even if your debt collector is calling aggressively, it is never a good idea to ignore their calls. A debt collector will have the authority to offer a repayment plan, or some other type of help to make it easier for you to pay off of your debt.</p>
<p>At times, they are capable of finding solutions to your financial problems. After all, they work with people like you every day. They can even offer you some helpful advice or they may be able to tell you about some helpful debt counselors. Unluckily, it has been mentioned that all stereotypes have some truth in them, and there will be an occasional debt collector who may use strong arm or even illegal tactics to collect money that is owed. If a collections agent calls you, and something doesn’t sit right with you, consult the FDCPA, and call your local attorney general’s office to report the incident.</p>

			<p>On February 22nd, 2010, the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act took effect. The CARD Act had one major purpose: to attempt to put a curb on credit card practices and set limits to the fees that credit card companies charge consumers. It was created with consumers in mind, setting limits to the amount of credit that will be available to them in this recession “for their own good.”</p>
<p>Because of the very important CARD Act, most banks and creditors have changed their business models by reducing potential risk to cardholders. They have dropped or restricted some borrowers with a poor financial history, tightened up credit lines, and are marketing less. Analysts predict credit limit reductions to have two main impacts for the collection industry.</p>
<p>One result of the CARD Act has been the setting of restrictions on the average size of accounts that are placed for collection. This, coupled with debtor’s behavior these past couple of years, where people generally spent savings and maxed out personal loans and home equity, raises eyebrows and concern, because for many consumers, credit cards are the only short term credit that is available to them at this moment.</p>
<p>Another giant impact of the CARD Act is a result of the provision that consumers are not able to pay off one credit card debt using a different card. While this may help debtors to be more fiscally responsible, this obviously has massive ramifications for the collection industry. Experts and leaders in the field hypothesize that the best way to deal with the enormous changes that have ensued is to remain flexible and to be creative. In addition to the same old telephone calls and collections letters, the internet can be seen as a good option for payment.</p>
<p>Researchers also remind us of a few ideas that we, as collection professionals should remember about the CARD Act. Excess payments should now go to pay off the accounts with highest interest balances first. The CARD Act also gives consumers the capacity to set their own credit limits that might be less than those set by the creditors, and marketing credit to college students and giving credit card access to people under twenty one will now be severely restricted.</p>
