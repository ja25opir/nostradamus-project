              <td align="left"><span class="style2">One of the questions that is asked the most by both the beginning and experienced Internet Marketer is, What are the best affiliate programs?<br><br>With literally thousands of affiliate programs on the Internet to choose from it is no surprise that people have problems deciding on the best ones to join and promote.<br><br>Today I am going to focus on things you need to take into consideration when trying to tell the difference between an outstanding affiliate program and the ones you should avoid like the plague.<br><br>Target Markets That You Have Some Knowledge In<br><br>When you know something about the market you are entering into it will save you time and money because you will reduce the amount of research that will need to be done in finding products that target customers in that market need.<br><br>If you already know the market you won't be spending a lot of time researching what the market needs because you will recognize these products when you find them.<br><br>Focus Your Efforts on Programs in “HOT” Markets<br><br>The best programs to promote are not only in hot markets but they also offer products that are needed by the target customers in that particular market but also are unique products as well so your competition is at a minimum.<br><br>Look For Affiliate Programs with High Pay Outs<br><br>The best ways to promote affiliate programs will be the same no matter what the price of the product. When you sell “High Ticket” items you will be using the same marketing strategies that you would use for products with small price tags.<br><br>So the question you need to ask yourself is “Why am I wasting my time and advertising dollars promoting products that will take me double or triple the effort to make good money?”<br><br>It is not only common sense but it is simple math as well. If one affiliate program pays $20 dollar per sale and another pays you $40 dollars per sale it is going to take you twice as many sales to generate the same profits from the first program as it will the second.<br><br>Seek Out Income Streams<br><br>If it cost you $1 dollar in advertising to gain one paying customer which would you choose:<br><br>1.A one time sale customer that you will have to continually promote other similar products to on a month to month basis so they spend additional money to increase your profits. -or-<br>2.A customer that pays a reoccurring membership fee every month that you automatically receive a percentage from.<br><br>You don't even have to bother answering the question for me. I already know your answer. If at all possible you want to focus your promotional efforts on the programs that are going to offer you the highest return (your commissions) for the lowest investment (your advertising dollars).<br><br>Some businesses that offer multiple products will offer their affiliates life-time commissions. So if you were the first affiliate to get a customer to buy a product from them you will receive commissions on every product they buy in the future from them no matter how they ended up being referred back to the site. These are also very nice programs to put your efforts into.<br><br>Start Your Own Mini-Affiliate Program<br><br>Some affiliate programs setup what is called a “Two-Tier” commission schedule. With these programs you not only receive commissions on sales that you have referred to the program but you can recruit other affiliates to the program and receive commissions on their referred sales as well.<br><br>The bottom-line is the more of these principles an affiliate program follows the more deserving of your time and effort they are.<br><p> About the Author
