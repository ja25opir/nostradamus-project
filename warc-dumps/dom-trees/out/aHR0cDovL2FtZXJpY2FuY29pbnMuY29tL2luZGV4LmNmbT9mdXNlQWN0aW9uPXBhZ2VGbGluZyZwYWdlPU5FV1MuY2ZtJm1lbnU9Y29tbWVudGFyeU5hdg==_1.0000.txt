But the U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars it wishes at essentially no cost".&nbsp; </i></p>

Its outperformance against equities has been consistent over past one, three, five and ten years and for that matter gold has also been the least volatile asset class.&nbsp; Its correlation with equities has remained zero or modestly negative, giving strong portfolio diversification.&nbsp; On an average monthly return basis gold tends to outperform when equities perform poorly.&nbsp; The presentation contained a fascinating table showing relative performance of different sterling based asset classes in each year from 2002 onwards and also showed that over the past ten years gold's annual return has been 14.3% in sterling terms, compared with 5.9% pa from bonds, 1.6% in cash and just 1.2% in real estate.&nbsp; Equity returns were negative.</p>

The Times article noted that gold's major supporters include liberal financier George Soros, Fox News personality Glenn Beck, and top New York hedge fund manager John A. Paulson who earned billions betting against sub-prime mortgages.<p>Among the people now moving to gold is Daniel J. Arbess, who manages more than $2 billion for a hedge fund. According to the Times, Mr. Arbess would not have taken a second look at gold a few years ago. Now he's a firm believer because of the risk to "fiat" currencies, i.e., currencies which are not backed by gold.</p>

"I would argue that any time the consumers of the two largest countries in the world are competing for a scarce asset, the rest of us should consider owning it."</p>

This is not for short-term profit, but for long-term protection. You would really need it if a monetary crisis or a war gets bad enough and lasts long enough that we have started to universally use coins as the alternative ârealâ currency. It might even not take that long for merchants to get the drift. During the OPEC gas crisis in the â70s when inflation and silver were in a runaway mode and gas prices were exploding, a few enterprising gas-station operators were advertising gas for a dime a gallon -- pre-1965, 90% silver dimes -- because a silver dime was worth more than the posted gas-price-per-gallon.</p>
                                                                                                                <p class="text">Like all insurance, the coins are there to use when bad things happen which you hope wonât happen. All insurance is a bet that bad things will happen. You win your bet only if you have a car crash, or a fire, or if you die. With orthodox insurance, it doesnât matter if you win or lose your bet, the premiums are gone forever. In the case of coin insurance, the premiums are still there forever and appreciating, no matter what.</p>

"I would argue that any time the consumers of the two largest countries in the world are competing for a scarce asset, the rest of us should consider owning it."</p>

About 80% of China's annual gold consumption goes toward making jewelry. The World Gold Council, established by a group of large mining companies to stimulate demand for the yellow metal, wants to increase demand for gold in China for investment purposes.</p>

One program the council hopes to promote as part of its deal with the bank is a "gold accumulation plan," in which investors give the bank money which it uses to buy gold on their behalf in daily increments over a period of time. The goal is to smooth out price differentials for investors, so they aren't put off from investing by gold's daily price volatility. The World Gold Council started a similar program about 20 years ago in Japan, which has worked well, said Albert Cheng, managing director for the Far East....</p>

At current rates of production, China would exhaust its known gold reserves in about six years, he said. While that doesn't mean China will have to stop mining in six years--it is highly likely to find more gold in the meantime--the figure nonetheless underscores the metal's scarcity in China. Telfer said the comparable figure in most countries with large gold reserves is about 15 years....</p>

                                                                                                                <p class="text"><strong><em>1. Obamanomics</em></strong>: Socialist states <em>always inflate </em>the paper currency. Obama, Congress, and the Federal Reserve are diluting the dollar like never before by creating more of it. Accommodating Obama and Congress, the Fed has manufactured trillions of dollars out of nothing at by far the fastest pace in history, and itâs accelerating. The government has given trillions to the big banks, which will loan the dollars into circulation or give them to politicians to spend into circulation. This money expansion currently dwarfs several times over the monetary explosion that led to the Carter-driven metals bull market in the â70s. I canât overstate what is happening. Economists may call this monetary-expansion process âinflationâ but it really should be called âdilutionââdilution of the money supply and consequently its value. Inevitably, sooner or later, consumer prices rise and laymen then mistakenly call that âinflation.â Calling rising prices inflation is like calling falling trees hurricanes. When will the public catch on? Price inflation and gold prices are the chief measurements of public awareness. Sooner or later, awareness becomes a critical mass, the public catches on, and the metals go through the stratosphere.</p>

Real money</em></strong>: Gold and silver (especially silver) have been real money over and over again, in all ages of time and on all continents. Ever since Gutenberg invented the printing press 400 years ago, the world has been littered with worthless dead paper currencies every seventy-five to eighty years, due to runaway money printing. <em>Every time </em>the dominant currency has been inflated, gold and silver coins have become hugely profitable investments, and sometimes the only surviving currency.</p>

Gold and silver as a means of exchange and a store of value have always survived. They have always been symbols of wealth, far more precious in our consciousness than any mere paper.</p>
                                                                                                                <p class="text">During periods of hyperinflation, there always comes a time when people refuse to accept more and more counterfeit, inflated money or base-metal coins in return for their hard-produced goods and services. At that point, society instinctively turns to gold and silver. It has happened over and over again, and as George Santayana said, âThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.â</p>
                                                                                                                <p class="text"><strong><em>3. Itâs early in the game</em></strong>: Gold and silver are <em>early in an historic bull market </em>(in fact, as this is written, itâs only a Golden Calf), making this a low-risk investment with an awesome upside for the long-term investor. Especially silver. This gold and silver bull market will dwarf the last great one in 1973-80, when fortunes were made by relatively small amounts of money invested by amateur investors (many of them my readers). All of the factors that created the last bull market are here again, only amplified several times.</p>
                                                                                                                <p class="text"><strong><em>4. Supply and demand</em></strong>: Both metals are far rarer than most people know. All the gold ever mined since the dawn of history, including that in Central banks, gold fillings, and sunken shipwrecks in the Caribbean, etc. would cover a football field about four-feet deep. It would make a cube about the size of a typical 8-room house. Demand is now leaping past new supplies. </p>
                                                                                                                <p class="text">Likewise, most of the easy silver has been mined over the centuries, even with primitive methods. For example, during the Roman millennium, they used silver coins for currency and exhausted the Spanish silver mines.</p>
                                                                                                                <p class="text">Now that prices are high enough to make gold and silver mining profitable again, it will take as much as seven to ten years to develop new mines, and stagnant supply and rising demand have made higher prices inevitable for the imminent future.</p>

This is telling, both from the perspective that they see some urgency to the matter, and that the acquisition targets are minerals.<br>

                                                                                                                So declared President Ahmadinejad last week. The Islamic republic has produced its first batch of high-level enriched uranium, which they claim is solely for electricity purposes but can also be used to create material for atomic weapons if enriched to 90%. In response, the US imposed new sanctions, and the United Nations is considering adding more of its own sanctions, too.<br>
                                                                                                                <br>
                                                                                                                The West recently proposed that Iran export its uranium for enrichment and then have it returned as fuel rods for a reactor. Iran demanded changes to that plan, which were rejected, so claimed they had "no choice" but to start enriching to higher levels on their own. "God willing," declared Ahmadinejad, "daily production will be tripled."<br>
                                                                                                                <br>

                                                                                                                <strong>#4. The US Government Must Inflate</strong><br>
                                                                                                                Here's another reason we think that sooner or later inflation trumps deflation: By 2020, government economists project that entitlement benefits (Social Security, Medicare, etc.), along with interest payments on the national debt, will devour 80% of all federal revenues.<br>
                                                                                                                <br>
                                                                                                                This assumes entitlement benefits don't grow, which, of course, they will. The overall national debt, meanwhile, will rise to 100% of GDP within a few years, an alarming level by any measure. Even Moody's warned that our credit status could lose its triple-A rating if the nation's finances don't improve, an unheard-of prospect just a few years ago.<br>
                                                                                                                <br>
                                                                                                                So, we're abruptly fleeing our debt-adding habits, right? As you probably heard last month, Obama signed legislation that raised the cap on government debt from $12.4 trillion ? already close to being breached ? to $14.3 trillion to permit more borrowing. As Doug Casey has pointed out numerous times, this is the exact opposite of what the government should be doing and will have serious inflationary ramifications.<br>
                                                                                                                <br>
                                                                                                                There's only one way out: devalue the Dollar to reduce the debt burden. And the direct result of that is a rising Gold Price for US investors. We may very well see another round of deflation, but the endgame is inflation.<br>
                                                                                                                <br>
                                                                                                                What I would point out is that any one of these reasons would be sufficient for wanting to put some gold in your portfolio. It's the cumulative effect that's potentially scary, one that argues we should be overweight precious metals at this point in history. The reasons are numerous and, in my opinion, overwhelming.<br>
                                                                                                                <br>

                                                                                                                  &nbsp; Departing from this&nbsp; analytic framework, we argued back in October 2008 that gold prices would move&nbsp; up to $1500/oz in three steps. The outburst of the credit crisis in August 2007&nbsp; marked the start of the first stage, with gold rising from $650/oz to about&nbsp; $950/oz. The second stage of gold price appreciation, we argued well over a&nbsp; year ago, would primarily be about USD weakness and lack of confidence in fiat currencies.&nbsp; We argued gold could break through $1200/oz in this second stage and strengthen&nbsp; against all currency crosses. The third and final stage will be driven, in our&nbsp; view, by a strong cyclical recovery in energy and commodity prices.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p>... we find that USD depreciation and currency&nbsp; risk have been the key contributors to higher gold prices in the last eight months... the weak dollar is&nbsp; pushing gold prices higher in USD, and the increase in global money supply is&nbsp; driving gold prices up in every currency.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p><strong>Compared to the&nbsp; expansion in the money supply ...</strong><br>
                                                                                                                  In our view, the massive&nbsp; expansion in money supply observed in 2008 represents a competitive debasement&nbsp; of fiat currencies relative to gold (Chart 66). With the exception of the JPY,&nbsp; broad money in local currency expanded at rates between 8.5% for the EUR and&nbsp; nearly 25% for the TRY, compared to an expansion in the global stock of gold of&nbsp; 1.18%. For the time being, however, the rapid increase in real money has not&nbsp; been accompanied by a broad-based increase in consumer prices as the credit&nbsp; multiplier has remained rather muted in most countries.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p><strong>...there is just not&nbsp; enough gold to go around</strong><br>
                                                                                                                  &nbsp; Top holders of currency&nbsp; reserves like China, Russia or India will likely need to increase&nbsp; their exposure to gold (Chart 67) as the value of fiat currency reserve holdings&nbsp; like the USD or the EUR comes into question. The obvious problem with Emerging&nbsp; Market Central Bank (EM CB) diversification is that there is simply not enough&nbsp; gold to go round...</p>
                                                                                                                  <p><strong>Further USD weakness&nbsp; requires a CNY revaluation</strong><br>
                                                                                                                  Of course, further dollar&nbsp; weakness may be required to drive gold prices higher, but there are natural&nbsp; limits to floating G10 currency appreciation against the USD. Our EM Fixed&nbsp; Income and FX Strategy team argues for EM FX appreciation against G10&nbsp; currencies (and against the USD) next year. But most floating EM FX currencies&nbsp; have already surged tremendously in recent months. In the case of the commodity&nbsp; exporters, the risk of catching the âDutch diseaseâ is increasing very rapidly.&nbsp; In our view, further weakness in the trade-weighted dollar would require a CNY&nbsp; revaluation. In turn, as EM CBs can not accumulate CNY, the only practical way&nbsp; to avoid adding EUR at these levels to EM CB portfolios is to buy gold.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p><strong>The point of fiat&nbsp; currencies is to debase them as needed</strong><br>
                                                                                                                  &nbsp; While some investors&nbsp; remain concerned that lax monetary policy could end up resulting in inflation&nbsp; sometime down the road, we would argue instead that the whole point of having a&nbsp; fiat currency is to be able to debase it when the economic conditions require&nbsp; it (Chart 68). As the combination of monetary and fiscal policy measures help&nbsp; create an upswing in economic activity over the next two years, cyclical&nbsp; pressures will come back into the system, likely resulting in a lot more money&nbsp; chasing the same oil barrels. As we expect gold to maintain its long-run relationship&nbsp; with other commodities, we see a third stage of gold price appreciation where&nbsp; prices push above $1500/oz on the back of higher oil and commodity prices.</p></div>

Green shoots of recovery are supposedly popping up all around the country, and the economy is expected to resume growing soon at an annual rate of 3% to 4%. Many of these are the same people who insisted that the economy would continue growing last year, even while it was clear that we were already in the beginning stages of a recession.</p>
                                                                                                                        <p>A false recovery is under way. I am reminded of the outlook in 1930, when the experts were certain that the worst of the Depression was over and that recovery was just around the corner. The economy and stock market seemed to be recovering, and there was optimism that the recession, like many of those before it, would be over in a year or less. Instead, the interventionist policies of Hoover and Roosevelt caused the Depression to worsen, and the Dow Jones industrial average did not recover to 1929 levels until 1954. I fear that our stimulus and bailout programs have already done too much to prevent the economy from recovering in a natural manner and will result in yet another asset bubble.</p>
                                                                                                                        <p>Anytime the central bank intervenes to pump trillions of dollars into the financial system, a bubble is created that must eventually deflate. We have seen the results of Alan Greenspan's excessively low interest rates: the housing bubble, the explosion of sub-prime loans and the subsequent collapse of the bubble, which took down numerous financial institutions. Rather than allow the market to correct itself and clear away the worst excesses of the boom period, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury colluded to put taxpayers on the hook for trillions of dollars. Those banks and financial institutions that took on the largest risks and performed worst were rewarded with billions in taxpayer dollars, allowing them to survive and compete with their better-managed peers.</p>
                                                                                                                        <p>This is nothing less than the creation of another bubble. By attempting to cushion the economy from the worst shocks of the housing bubble's collapse, the Federal Reserve has ensured that the ultimate correction of its flawed economic policies will be more severe than it otherwise would have been. Even with the massive interventions, unemployment is near 10% and likely to increase, foreigners are cutting back on purchases of Treasury debt and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remains bloated at an unprecedented $2 trillion. Can anyone realistically argue that a few small up-ticks in a handful of economic indicators are a sign that the recession is over?</p>
                                                                                                                        <p>What is more likely happening is a repeat of the Great Depression. We might have up to a year or so of an economy growing just slightly above stagnation, followed by a drop in growth worse than anything we have seen in the past two years. As the housing market fails to return to any sense of normalcy, commercial real estate begins to collapse and manufacturers produce goods that cannot be purchased by debt-strapped consumers, the economy will falter. That will go on until we come to our senses and end this wasteful government spending.</p>
                                                                                                                        <p>Government intervention cannot lead to economic growth. Where does the money come from for Tarp (Treasury's program to buy bad bank paper), the stimulus handouts and the cash for clunkers? It can come only from taxpayers, from sales of Treasury debt or through the printing of new money. Paying for these programs out of tax revenues is pure redistribution; it takes money out of one person's pocket and gives it to someone else without creating any new wealth. Besides, tax revenues have fallen drastically as unemployment has risen, yet government spending continues to increase. As for Treasury debt, the Chinese and other foreign investors are more and more reluctant to buy it, denominated as it is in depreciating dollars.</p>

Wait just a minute, you exclaim! What in the world are you talking about? How could gold investing be the only investing? That makes no sense at all! Well, the answer to that question may seem like it doesn't come from this world, and that is partly correct. The world as we know it is about to change and gold investing is going to become the only investing!<p>The U.S. Dollar is being destroyed by the government and the Federal Reserve. The policy that the Fed has introduced, quantitative easing, is going to insure inflation in the the years ahead and for years to come. Gold will be the beneficiary of this misguided policy and that is why gold investing will be the only investing for the next couple of years.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p>Gold is real money, real wealth. The reason that gold is real wealth is because it is in limited supply, in great demand and it cost a lot to coax it out of the ground. In essence it is the anti-fiat currency. It is the direct opposite of everything that paper money is. Fiat currencies are printed for next to nothing and they can be expanded on a whim. Governments can do whatever they want with paper money and pass the consequences on to the taxpayer with out calling it a tax increase. The best of both worlds for the bloated ever expanding government. This is one more reason why, soon, gold investing will be the only investing.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p>Now is the time to be gold investing, because the dollars that are put into gold now will come back triple fold. Physical gold, coins and gold bullion, are your security blanket that will keep you warm when things get cold out there. Investing in gold stocks allows you to leverage your money and go for the moon shot when the dollar really takes a dive!</p>
                                                                                                                  <p>Most people are never willing to see the dramatic changes that are on the horizon, but rather prefer to live in the world of it can't happen here. Those that venture into the world of gold investing and stay the course, will reap substantial rewards in the very near future. In the old days the standard was to have 10 percent of your portfolio in precious metals... It is always wise to remember that the trend is your friend, and right now the trend is changing to gold investing!</p></div>
