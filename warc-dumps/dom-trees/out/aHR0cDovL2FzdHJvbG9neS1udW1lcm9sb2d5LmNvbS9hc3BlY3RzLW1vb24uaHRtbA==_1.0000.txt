            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Mercury</b></dt>

            <dt> The Moon and Mercury in conjunction marks an
increase in your sympathetic and understanding nature. You relate well
to people because of the ease with which you communicate your feelings.
You find it easy to learn new material and you have no problems
retaining what you learn. Your most effective means of learning is by
experiences, not study. At an early age you were taught how important
it was to develop your mind and you are always likely to be interested
in doing so. You adapt readily to change and progress. You may be a
little sensitive to criticism because you read more into circumstances
that may exist. Nonetheless, this aspect will make it easy for you to
work and deal with people even when some aspects of the reading suggest
otherwise. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Venus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The Moon and Venus in conjunction shows an
ability to relate very easily to people. You find it easy to be
friendly with just about everyone. Occasionally, you can be so friendly
that you may arouse suspicions in some more jaded souls. You're never
one to wait for the other person to make the first gesture when
introduced, and you can put anyone at ease with your affable ways. You
are extremely responsive to friendliness and abhor rudeness. There is
little pretense about you. You act the way you do simply because you
think it is and because of your early training. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Mars</b> </dt>

            <dt>The conjunction of the Moon and Mars shows much
emotional anxiety and impatience. It is an aspect that seems to
energize emotions and those emotions may often come out with Martian or
aggressive qualities. Your feelings are usually very active, and always
in a state of turmoil. In short, your emotions are intense. This
conjunction can show passions that are very ardent and demanding, and
actions can sometimes be blind to caution and common sense. There are
tendencies that may lead you to accomplish much if you can only guide
these energies with some wisdom. Often, however, a more destructive
vindictive facet to the personality results from this aspect. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Jupiter</b> </dt>

            <dt>The conjunction of the Moon and Jupiter shows a
deep sensitivity to your environment, which you truly want to
understand as fully as possible. The aspect confers sympathy and
generosity. Often individuals having this combination find jobs working
with the underprivileged, in rehabilitation programs, or a similar type
of occupation. Your honest concern for others brings you the trust and
cooperation of most of those with whom you come in contact. You are a
giving person and you find success because of this. Beware of
over-extending your physical energies. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Saturn</b> </dt>

            <dt>The conjunction of the Moon and Saturn suggests
that you are emotionally defensive, cautious, and reserved. You are apt
to question your self-worth and worry about whether you really make a
difference. It's hard for you to form close emotional ties because of
your negative and restrained attitudes. The affects of this aspect may
stem from harsh discipline or other traumatic experiences in your
formative years. For whatever reason, you have a tendency always to
expect the worse. Success does come easy to you because of your stern,
but always fair management style. Honesty is a hallmark of your nature,
and you can always be relied on to render unbiased opinions. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Uranus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The conjunction of the Moon and Uranus denotes
strong intuitions. It also makes you very independent. You rebel
against set ways of doing acting and orthodox principles. High
emotional tension can produce sudden impulses in your behavior that
cause difficulties. Dull routine duties are a problem for you, and
these can have a damaging effect on your nervous system. You moods
change rapidly, you seem irritated, and you aren't very reliable when
this aspect is active. Often, you are viewed as a character and you
express yourself with verve. You are popular because of your tolerance
and understanding of others and your ability to see both side of almost
any issue. Your optimism and honesty are refreshing and will carry you
far. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Neptune</b> </dt>

            <dt>The conjunction of the Moon and Neptune shows
daydreaming, or at least a highly imaginative and sensitive nature. You
have strong psychic abilities that makes you aware of stimuli others
fail to detect. You're the type who is willing to help anyone. Yet
somehow you end up getting blamed for their failures and rarely get
much credit for their successes. Because your mind wants to wander, you
need stimulating challenges and you must avoid boring and repetitive
tasks. You are a little idealistic in accessing people, and you often
get fooled and disappointed. You're very much the romantic, and it's
hard for anyone to measure up to your expectations. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon conjunct Pluto</b> </dt>

            <dt>The conjunction of the Moon and Pluto produces an
intense romantic nature. You seek relationships with those who feel as
deeply and as tenaciously as you do. You are a very possessive and
demanding person, rarely impulsive or casual. It's hard to satisfy your
emotional needs for the perfect relationship because you are so
idealistic and demanding. These traits often extend to friendships, as
well. Because of this your friends are few but extremely close. You are
a hard person to live with because you require so much of those to whom
you are near. You can be tyrannical and alienating, at times. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><a name="The Sextiles"></a><b>Moon

            <dt>The sextile aspect formed between the Moon and
Venus shows the need and disposition for happy personal relationships.
There is a sense of sharing and communication in partnerships that will
usually produce good results. You succeed socially because you can
usually think of something good to say about nearly anyone. You're
willing to discuss problems, but your optimistic attitude keeps you

well and most of the time they do. Rarely is your progress impeded by
misunderstandings with others. </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon sextile Mars</b> </dt>

            <dt>The sextile aspect of the Moon with Mars gives
the emotional force necessary to win many battles. Any tendency to
argue and flare up on occasion is kept under control, and you aren't a
person apt to have difficulties with people. It does make you an
energetic person, and one who has an infectious and personable manner.
You respond to people eagerly, and your enthusiasm stimulates them to
respond to you as well. While impulsive by nature, you have due respect
for the feelings of others. Even when you do lose control of your
temper, you are not one to hold a grudge. You simply work out your
differences, and proceed. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

people are marked in your nature. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon sextile Saturn</b> </dt>

            <dt>The Moon sextile Saturn shows a degree of reserve
and caution in your feelings in close relationships. You have a
willingness to discuss problems that arise, and you sincerely try to
understand. You are modestly ambitious, but never likely to sacrifice
integrity to get ahead. Determination may be stronger than otherwise
indicated in the chart. You communicate well, and teaching comes
naturally for you. You project knowledge clearly and with real
authority. You seek a partner who is sincere and has clearly
established plans for achieving goals. You respond to people with good
resources of mind and spirit, and besides these traits they must have
stable emotions. In your free time you read or study, recognizing that

            <dt><b>Moon sextile Uranus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The sextile aspect formed between the Moon and
Uranus shows quick emotional responses. This promotes rapport with
people. You are very progressive in your views, looking to the future
with little regard for the past. Your imagination is uniquely designed
to solve everyday problems in unusual ways. You are quick to embrace
new ideas and take advantage of opportunities. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon sextile Neptune</b> </dt>

            <dt>The sextile aspect between the Moon and Neptune
shows such a vivid imagination that you may possess psychic potentials.
Your hunches, that are often accurate, may stem from an unconscious
prompting connected to this placement. Your keen emotional
sensitivities forms empathy with others. There is a tendency to
idealize and sometimes fool yourself, confusing the real and the
imagined. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon sextile Pluto</b> </dt>

            <dt>The sextile between the Moon and Pluto generates
emotional understanding in your nature. You are deeply emotional, but
controlled. You enjoy personal contact with others, yet you will not
waste time with casual relationships. Occasionally, you may withdraw
into yourself, and alienate others. You are an excellent manager
because you can remove the nonessentials in your life. You have the
innate ability to understand and respond to others. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><a name="The Squares"></a><b>Moon
square Mercury</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Mercury
suggests conflict between your mind and your emotions. You have
difficulties making reasonable judgments because your feelings get in
the way. Irrational decisions place you at odds with people sometimes,
and you have the feeling that you're being treated unfairly when this
may not be the case. You dwell on trivial personal matters and may have
a real sense of insecurity. You can communicate well with those that
are very close to you. Yet your peer group outside the family can be a
problem with which you must deal before you can achieve success. Avoid
the tendency to discredit the ideas of others when they disagree with
your ideas or challenge you. Try to evaluate the ideas of others in an
objective and quiet manner. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Venus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Venus
shows you are apprehensive about forming close emotional ties because
of the responsibility they bring. Something in your upbringing or
experiences makes it hard for you to admit your feelings. This aspect
doesn't make you reject companionship, but instead you form connections
that are not desirable or for some reason not workable. It may be
preferable for you to be independent for some time until you have
learned to understand people and have an accurate sense of their
motives. A high degree of emotionalism and sentimentality must be
understood and overcome before entering into a binding commitment. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Mars</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Mars shows
that you have an emotionally volatile nature. It suggests the tendency
to become easily upset. You may take matters entirely too personal and
often loose your cool. This aspect makes human relationships more
difficult because of being demanding or very sensitive. You need to
make your way in the world with no interference, and this is very
difficult for anyone to do. With maturity you will likely learn to be
less demanding on others and refrain from taking offense so easily and
quickly. Channeled properly, your energy is boundless, and you can move
mountains. Often this aspect results in many emotional crises that can
lead to poor health if not handled properly. Harmony in relationships
must be a conscious goal. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Jupiter</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Jupiter
shows a state of emotional excess. This aspect causes you to make
hasty, sometimes regrettable decisions. Often, you have a lack of
concern about what others think when you make snap judgments and
irresponsible decisions on too few facts. You are self-indulgent, and
frequently too indulgent of others, as well. You can be generous to a
fault, periodically finding yourself short of needed funds. Your
happy-go-lucky demeanor makes you popular, but not always stable. Mood
swings vacillate between periods of intense enthusiasm and periods of
nonproductive apathy. This is a difficult aspect that requires constant
restraint and effort to gain balance and moderation. This placement has
a dampening effect on any ambitions shown elsewhere in the chart, and
must be overcome before success can be attained. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Saturn</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Saturn
suggests a serious side to your nature. There is a strong urge to get
ahead. Yet your demeanor can get heavy sometimes and you can turn moody
and depressed. Being temperamental in youth can cause you many
problems. A guilt complex falls away with maturity. There is a lot of
negativism and insecurity associated with this aspect, but there is
also an ability to learn by mistakes. You understand yourself well, and
you work harder than most people to prove yourself. With this aspect in
your chart, you must learn to handle your frustration, depression and
dissatisfaction. Although determined and apparently ardent in emotional
matters, you can be pretty cold when it suits your purposes. Little of
a personal nature is allowed to interfere with the main stream of your
intentions. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Uranus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Uranus
promises an ingenious imagination. It also produces emotional
perversity and sudden inexplicable changes in moods. You become easily
bored, throwing over one activity for something else more exciting.
Frequent upsets and changes in circumstances, may be the order of your
life. Your hair-trigger temper can fly whenever, even toward those
close to you. This aspect denotes much emotional tension. As you
mature, this aspect may mark you as an advanced thinker, but one likely
to remain a law unto self. Tact is something you have to learn to fit
more comfortable into society. Your uncompromising honesty and
painfully truthful criticisms can make life difficult at times. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Neptune</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Neptune
suggests you have difficulty separating fact and fiction. You may be
artistic talent, but reality and imagination often blur. You try to
adjust reality to fit your emotional view of the matter. When this is
not possible there is usually an effort to escape or avoid
confrontation. You feel that you are persecuted by your
responsibilities at home or at work. You may try to escape or reject
them. There is a need to examine situations intellectually instead of
emotionally, and then to make fair and firm judgments. There is a naive
charm to your character. Yet your impractical approach to problems can
impede your progress until you get your feet more firmly planted on the
ground. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon square Pluto</b> </dt>

            <dt>The square formed between the Moon and Pluto
shows you have an intense emotional nature. There are some difficulties
in relationships because of it. Emotional responsibility is a burden
for you. You may forget the past, and break any ties that confine. You
are a loner at heart, but an ardent nature can prompt relationships
that don't impose to many limits. This aspect shows a lack of interest
in material matters. You're likely to be put off by trivialities and
petty details of any sort. You're concerned only with issues that you
consider important or unique in some way. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><a name="The Trines"></a><b>Moon
trine Mercury</b> </dt>

            <dt>The trine formed between the Moon and Mercury
shows a shrewd, careful, and common sense mind. You evaluate your
reactions to people, events and situations quickly. You have much
comprehension in your dealings with people, and an amazingly retentive
memory. You have a logical, judicious, and pleasant way of expressing
yourself and you do so in a straightforward fashion. You have few, if
any, emotional anxieties, and any you have you're very aware of and can
handle. This aspect is favorable for communicating with others and
especially in handling domestic affairs. You don't dwell on negative
thoughts and with your natural compassion and sincere concern for
people, you can often help those that do. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Venus</b> </dt>

            <dt>A trine connecting the Moon and Venus smooths
the disposition, and makes life more harmonious in many ways. There is
an attractiveness and a gentleness in the personality that can help you
socially, if you let it. You trust people, and usually feel secure in
your relationships. Optimism marks your approach to life, and matters
work out well for you. Even when they don't, at least you had good
intentions. You are never coarse or vulgar, and people who display such
traits offend you. Your judgment is good, but you don't try to override
other people's opinion. Unless your chart is a very difficult one, you
are rarely, if ever, negative. Artistic talents are often present with
this aspect. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Mars</b> </dt>

            <dt>The Moon forms a trine with Mars denoting a very
active emotional nature and much psychic energy. You possess the
ability to back your strong imagination with will and action. You do
more than is physically required, whenever you can. You have strong
feelings, but these feelings are controlled and constructive. In
general, you deal with people well. You can be firm and forceful
without becoming abusive and violent. You express a self-confidence
that assures you won't be threatened by associates or competitors. You
have the need to fight for what is right, but you do so in a fair and
evenhanded way. Actions are unbiased and just. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Jupiter</b> </dt>

            <dt>The Moon forms a trine with Jupiter showing you
possess a glowing, generous personality. You relate easily to people
because when everything is said and done, you are a very magnanimous
person. You have a confidence that you can deal with about any crisis
in your life and your enthusiasm generates optimism in those around
you. This position shows a civic-minded person, with altruism and
religious devotion well marked in your makeup. Your imagination is
expansive, and you can see ways to work out most problems. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Saturn</b> </dt>

            <dt>The trine between the Moon and Saturn shows that
early upbringing and experiences have given you a prudent and common
sense approach to life. Honesty runs strong in your nature. A sense of
responsibility and of carrying out obligations are characteristic of
this placement. You can develop a very good business sense. You have a
firm understanding that personal effort and patience are the
ingredients necessary for long-range achievements. You may not develop
a large circle of friends unless other ingredients in your chart
suggest a social attitude. Yet those friends you do make are very
durable and lasting. Personal dignity and a sense of responsibility are
very strong in your outlook and in your actions. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Uranus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The trine formed between the Moon and Uranus
suggests that your early environment and experiences gave you an
inquiring mind. You're mentally alert and able to absorb knowledge
easily. You relate well to people because you listen well and
appreciate the opinions of others. You hold your own in an argument
because you are always well armed with the facts. You're not exactly a
rebel to authority, but you never hesitate to challenge anyone who
assumes power irresponsibly. Your thinking integrates experiences of
the past with a clear vision of the possibilities in the future. You've
learned from your past, yet you're anything but old-fashioned. Your
colorful expression is original and spontaneously imaginative. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Neptune</b> </dt>

            <dt>The trine formed between the Moon and Neptune
denotes close ties with the family. This bond may not be consciously
apparent to you. There is a link from the past producing an unconscious
prompting that plays an important part in your decision making. You
have a keen psychic sensitivity, and you express your creativity in
prophetic or intuitive ways; you are in tune spiritually. This aspect
often gives a love of the arts, especially music. You may dramatize
life, and exaggerate and distort events. Apathy may be one of your
larger liabilities. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon trine Pluto</b> </dt>

            <dt>The favorable aspect formed between the Moon and
Pluto strengthens your will to handle emotional problems in your life.
This aspect provides you the talent to improve domestic and business
matters by uncluttering your life. You're able to relinquish old
emotional habits. You know your capabilities and you know your limits.
You can neither be forced into doing what you don't wish to do, nor
deterred from gaining your intended objectives. You are well respected
because of your character and your ability to hold important issues in
confidence when this is required of you. You have much energy which is
well regulated and controlled. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><a name="The Oppositions"></a><b>Moon
opposed Mercury</b> </dt>

            <dt>The Moon and Mercury in opposition suggests that
it's hard to bring emotions and reason into balance. Issues are clouded
by concern over trivialities, and emotional response often wins over
common sense. Conversely, cold logic sometimes overcomes due concern
for the individual. In either case, you find it hard to integrate
feelings and thinking. It's hard to predict your conclusions on any
particular issue. Occasionally, you become nervous and emotionally
troubled. When this aspect is active by transit, you may be easily
irritated and argue at the slightest provocation. This is not
necessarily your normal mode of response. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Venus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The opposition between the Moon and Venus shows a
degree of conflict in relationships no matter how hard you try to
please. And you do try hard to please. You may be generous in your
praise of others, but somehow your sincerity is called into question.
You may become emotionally over-sensitive, and make special efforts to
avoid disapproval despite your need for acceptance. When you expect too
much from those you are close to, you are often disappointed. As a
substitute for emotional satisfaction, you are somewhat self-indulgent.
You display a weakness for comforts and luxuries. Your money conditions
can cause problems if not carefully controlled. Sexual excesses can be
a product of your feelings of being unloved. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Mars</b> </dt>

            <dt>The opposition between the Moon and Mars shows
continuous crises in relationships because it is so hard for you to
compromise. You get into disputes about the most insignificant matters.
Your personality is sparkling and outgoing, but feelings are intense,
and you are quick to strike back when criticized. You meet people
easily and eagerly. This eagerness often gets you involved with
individual with whom you have little in common. Permanent relationships
are difficult for you to cultivate. This is partly because of the
individuals to whom you are attracted, and in part because you become
so overbearing and dominating. You become emotionally pushy and
intolerant of anyone who refuses to submit to your demands. In business
you meet competition well, but have difficulty dealing with authority.
You have trouble following the rules. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Jupiter</b> </dt>

            <dt>The opposition between the moon and Jupiter shows
a lack of appreciation of your actual worth. You may be a highly
developed individual with much creative ability, and still question the
importance of those abilities. You feel the need to be around people
you highly respect, to have their reassurance of your talent, and their
advice. You often place your faith in those who don't deserve it, and
you can be too generous with these types. You attract money easily, but
your judgment in spending it is sometimes not so sound. You are
generous, but you have a tendency to give to the wrong causes. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Saturn</b> </dt>

            <dt>The opposition between the Moon and Saturn
suggests a negative mental attitude and often a restriction of the
spontaneous flow of ideas. Intellectual responses are somewhat slowed.
Even if you are very bright, the inability to express self in other
than a prosaic manner often hides real mental abilities. Thus, you are
more contemplative than conversational, but nonetheless a good
listener. You are austere in your behavior and having fun is something
that is hard for you to do chiefly because you worry too much. You
function well when you are self-employed or at least have a free hand
in deciding what you do. You lack emotional flexibility and optimism in
your dealing with others, and you may sometimes display a stiff formal
manner that can make others ill at ease. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Uranus</b> </dt>

            <dt>The Moon and Uranus form an opposition in your
chart. This opposition suggests a conflict in your life regarding
emotional matters. The Moon denotes emotions and Uranus produces
unstable situations. Thus, you may be called on to deal with
unpredictable emotions that may appear as nervous tension. It may
require conscious effort on your part to maintain a responsible role in
your domestic affairs. There is a tendency for you to attract a mate
displaying forceful traits. This individual is likely to dominate you.
Males have more difficulties than female with this aspect because it
frequently sets up problems with females, including the mother. In
either sex, there is a constant demand to decide for others that
generates stress between the mental and emotional faculties. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Neptune</b> </dt>

            <dt>The opposition between the Moon and Neptune shows
talent and creativity. Yet emotions govern most of your actions. You
have some difficulty separating truth from fiction, and you may create
illusions about yourself and others. Objectives are obscure, and you
lack the ability to plan your life in an orderly fashion. You may
experience periods when you are lacking in self-confidence. You can
become an escapist at these times. People sometimes take advantage of
you because you become so emotionally involved with their problems. </dt>

            <dt>&nbsp; </dt>

            <dt><b>Moon opposed Pluto</b> </dt>

            <dt>The opposition between the Moon and Pluto
suggests a very demonstrative show of affections and a strong
sensitivity to any signs of rejection. Occasionally, this aspect
denotes the loner. You try to control your family and friends, often
displaying emotional vehemence in your relationships. This aspect may
show an alternating from aggressiveness to austerity in love and
romance. This aspect brings jealousy, impulsiveness and sensuality.
Perhaps because of your relationship with your parents, you may feel
rejected occasionally, and you may seek drastic solutions to your
problems. You must learn to handle your attitude of intolerance in
relationships.&nbsp; </dt>
