<br><u>Acquirer is White Knight Flag</u>: Y' indicates that an acquirer has made a friendly offer or has reached an agreement to acquire a target that is currently the subject of a hostile or unsolicited offer by another company; acquirer is a White Knight. A 'Squire' is very similar to a 'White Knight', the only difference being that the 'Squire' only acquires a blocking minority stake and does not acquire a majority. The result is the same however, the hostile bid is thwarted.
<br><u>Bankruptcy Flag</u>: Yes/No flag set to 'Y' when the target company is bankrupt or goes bankrupt during the transaction.
<br><u>Block Purchase Flag</u>: 'Y' indicates that a company is repurchasing shares or acquiring a stake in a public company from a third party through private negotiations.
<br><u>Collar Deal Flag</u>: 'Y' indicates that the exact consideration offered in a stock swap transaction is based on a set range which is usually determined by the acquirer's average closing stock price prior to the close of the deal. For example, if the acquirer's average closing stock price prior to the close fell into the high end of the range, the target shareholders would receive the number of shares defined in the collar.
<br><u>Creeping Purchase Flag</u>: Yes/No flag set to 'Y' when the acquirer has made creeping purchases; that is, accumulates a majority interest through a series of stake purchases, either through private or open market transactions.
