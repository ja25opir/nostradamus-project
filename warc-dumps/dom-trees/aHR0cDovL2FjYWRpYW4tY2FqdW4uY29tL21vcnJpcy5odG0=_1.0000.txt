                    <p>Halifax, Nova    Scotia, 11   January, 1762. My Lords,—</p>
                    <p>As to the present state of all the Settlements, I beg leave  humbly to refer to a full and exact Account returned me by the Chief Surveyor  and which I have the honour now to transmit of every settled Township in the  Province, the Number of Families and Persons, of their cleared Upland, and  Marsh Acres, comprising likewise a distinct and Minute Description of the  present General State of the Province, its Productions and Advantages for  Commerce, what further Improvements may be yet made for the benefit of Great  Britain and the Province in its Trade and Fishery. This account, My Lords,  contains a proposition for introducing into the Province the Whale Fishery more  particularly enlarged upon in a letter sent me by Mr. Crawley, One of His  Majesty's Council, which I have the honor now to present, with my humblest  Address, for the Consideration, by Your Lordships, of this Plan, so seemingly  beneficial for the Mother Kingdom and this Province. With these Papers are also  humbly transmitted to Your Lordships, a Chart of the Peninsula   of Nova Scotia, containing  delineations of the several Townships, and a Chart of the Basin   of Mines and Cobequid   Bay, with another of the District  of Chignectou and a Plan of the Lands upon St. John's   River. </p>
                    <p>*******</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to be with the highest obedience,</p>
                    <p>My Lords, 
                      Your Lordships Most Dutiful and Most Humbly Devoted Servant, </p>
                    <p>Jonathan Belcher. The Rt. Hon'ble. The Lord Commissioners for Trade and Plantations.</p>
                    <p>Enclosure in letter of J. Belcher, Esqr., to Lords of Trade  dated 11 January 1762.</p>
                    <p>A Description of the several towns in the Province of Nova  Scotia with the Lands comprehended in and bordering upon said Towns, Drawn up  by Order of the Honorable Jonathan Belcher, Esqr., Lieutenant Governor and  Commander in Chief of the said Province.</p>
                    <p><strong>THE TOWN OF HALIFAX.</strong></p>
                    <p>This Town is Situated on one of the finest Harbours in the  Universe, easy of Access, the Channel deep enough for Capital Ships, and  Capacious enough to hold all the Navy of England.</p>
                    <p>Two Hundred Sail have anchored before the Town within  George's Island, and room enough for as many more ; The Town has at present  including both Suburbs, about Seven Hundred Houses, and about Twenty five  Hundred Inhabitants of all sorts ; The principal Support of these Inhabitants  depend on the Navy and Army stationed there, and a few Civil Officers supported  by the Government at Home. The Country about it for fifteen Miles on every side  is in general high Mountainous Rocky Land, incapable of being improved but at  an expense which will greatly exceed the Value of such Lands when improved. Not  one Family in the Town nor in the parts Circumjacent that subsist by Husbandry.  In 1750 General Cornwallis ordered the Division of the Peninsula in which the  Town of Halifax stands, containing about three Thousand Acres, to be divided  into Five Acre Lots among the inhabitants to Improve, and at the same time by  an Excise laid on Spirituous Liquors, a Bounty of Twenty Shillings per Acre was  ordered to be paid for every Acre fenced and cleared of the Woods ; by this the  Inhabitants encouraged, cleared and fenced about two Hundred Lots, containing  about a Thousand Acres, and sowed with Grass Seed, but all the Lind being  covered with fell'n Trees and the moss becoming dry by removing the Trees, was  fired and with extreme Violence (as dry Moss burns like wild Fire,) destroyed  all the Fences, and discovered that the Soil in general was covered with a bed  of Stones, and no attempts have been made since of improving them. 1752 General  Cornwallis, upon the Application of Several Inhabitants granted a Range of Farm  Lots consisting of about Two Hundred Acres to each proprietor, all bordering on  the Harbour of Halifax and Bedford Basin, fronting on the Water ; an  Advantageous Situation for improvement, as the Trees growing on said Grants  were near the Water, and a Market always for Cordwood sufficient to pay the  charges of clearing : The proprietors therefore soon began to clear those parts  near the Water, but when the underbrush and Moss were burnt off, the Soil was  found to be covered with a bed of Stones, and nothing further has been done  since towards any improvement of them, nor is it likely any one proprietor will  expend anything further to prevent a Forfeiture.</p>
                    <p>The late Governor Lawrence, as the Inhabitants were obliged  to purchase their Hay from the Massachusetts at excessive prices, procured an  Act of Assembly giving a Bounty on the erecting Stone Wall fences (the Timber  being for the most part consumed by the Fire) and also a bounty on every gross  Hundred weight of English Hay raised within the Peninsula ; In Consequence of  which about Seventy Acres at an expence of about eighty dollars per Acre have  been enclosed, and by removing the Stones and leveling the soil, and manuring  it with Dung it has produced a few Loads of Hay, and these Lands excepting some  few Garden Lots, are all the Improvements in and about Halifax.</p>
                    <p><strong>DARTMOUTH</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The Town of Dartmouth  situated on the opposite side of the Harbour has at present two Families  residing there who subsist by Cutting Wood.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                      <strong>LAWRENCE TOWN</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In 1754, Governor Lawrence in order to promote the settling  the Country granted to Twenty proprietors Twenty Thousand Acres of Land about  four Leagues East of Halifax, which was erected into a Township by the name of  Lawrence Town. The Proprietors obliging themselves to settle Twenty Families at  their own expence, and the Government promising to build a Block-house, and to  secure them by a guard. Accordingly Twenty Families were settled by the  proprietors, maintained at their Ex- pence and stocked with Cattle ; the  Inhabitants resided there three years, and by their Improvements had just arrived  at a state of supporting themselves when General Hop- son then Commanding the  Troops in Nova Scotia, ordered the Garrison to be removed, and the buildings  and Stockades to be demolished whereby the proprietors sustained a Loss of Six  Hundred Pounds Sterling which they had expended on promoting the Settlement,  and could obtain nothing in Recompence, but an assurance that the Lands should  not by this means, (as it was judged necessary for the preservation of the  Province), be Subject to, a Forfeiture. All the Lands, from Jebucto [Chebucto]  head stretching Westward to St. Margaret's Bay are in general of a Stony Soil,  or rather Rocks covered with moss, for wherever the Inhabitants have endeavored  a Settlement, upon clearing the woods and burning the moss nothing but solid  Rocks appear underneath.</p>
                    <p><strong>ST. MARGARET’S BAY</strong></p>
                    <p>St. Margaret's Bay is a large Capacious Harbour about one  mile and a half wide, at its entrance, but within is four Leagues deep, and  near two Leagues wide, with many Islands within conveniently situated for the  Boat fishery, with good Boat Harbours ; the Linds lying on both sides are well  Timbered, but the Soil stony and in many places Barren Rocks, a few persons  have attempted to settle on the Islands for the sake of tho Boat Cod Fishery, and  Salmon which abound here, but at present not a single person is Settled there.  Within this Bay are several small Rivers, with water enough for Sawmills, and  great Quantities of Spruce &amp;с. for Deal Boards.</p>
                    <p><strong>CHESTER</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The next Lands westward is the Township   of Chester, this township was begun  1760. There is about Thirty Families containing about One Hundred and twenty  persons settled from New England with their Stock, no  Improvements but what the present Inhabitants have made. The front of this  Township is situated at the Bottom of Mahone Bay, has several small Islands  annex'd to it, is very conveniently situated- for the Boat Cod Fishery and  having good Boat Harbours within the Islands. The Lands in this Township are  well Cloathed with Timber of the Spruce and Fir kind in great Quantities.  Several convenient Streams for erecting Saw-mills. The Inhabitants of this  Township will soon be in a good way of supporting themselves by the Lumber  Trade and Fishery.</p>
                    <p><strong>LUNESBURG</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The next Lands lying westward is the Township   of Lunenburg bounded East by Mahone   Bay, South on the Ocean, West by  the Harbour and River of La    Have. This in general is a Tract of good Land,  not so Stony a Soil as the Lands to the eastward, but it is in general very  thick Timbered Birch, Beach. Spruce, Fin-, Hemlock with a- mixture of some Oak,  are the natural growth in general.</p>
                    <p>The Township first began its Settlement in 1753 by the Dutch  and Germans who had been transported into the Colony in the two preceding  years, it then contained about Four Hundred Families and proprietors consisting  of about fifteen Hundred persons. These Inhabitants were furnished with  materials for Building, a Thousand</p>
                    <p>», pound Sterling laid out in Cattle, and maintained by the  Government wholly for nine years, and considerable quantities of Flour, and at  the removal of the French, as many Cattle as they could possibly keep, and  grain from year to year has been given them till the last year. They have  rather diminished than increased. Some Roman Catholics both German and French  deserted from the Settlement to the French : Several Families quitted their  Farms and came back and settled at Halifax.  The present Inhabitants have cleared and improv'd about Ten Acres, one with  another. The}' supply Halifax  chieflv with Roots, Cordwood, Timber and some Boards. They have no inclination  for the Fishery tho well situated for that purpose. As the chief of their time  is spent in clearing and improving their Lands they will soon be able to  support themselves, and afford some assistance to the Neighbouring Settlements.</p>
                    <p><strong>DUBLIN</strong>.</p>
                    <p>This Township seated upon the Harbour, and River   of Le Have was granted 1760 To Two  Hundred and Sixty proprietors in the Colony of Connecticut, very few have  attempted to settle and those without Ability to Support themselves, these few  resided there about nine months and then quitted it : It remains at present  without Inhabitants. The Lands bordering on Le Have Harbour and River are  Mountainous, the Soil Stony, thick Timbered with Spruce, Black Burch, Fir, and  in general with the same kind of Timber as Lunenburg : The West part of the  Township about Petite Riviere is of better Soil, has a great mixture of Oak  with the other Timber, has a good Salmon Fishery, and the Lands more suitable  for Farming. About the Harbour of Le Have are many Islands well situated for  the curing and drying Cod fish, the Outward Harbour lies too open to the Sea  and is full of Shaols, but the River is an excellent Harbour, very capacious  and Navigable, having Nine fathom at its entrance and gradual soundings to  three fathom at Nine Miles and Navigable for Sloops and Smaller Vessels to the  Falls, twelve Miles from its entrance.</p>
                    <p><strong>LIVERPOOL</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Liverpool is the next Town to Dublin  Westward. This town was begun 1760.; Its present inhabitants amount to Ninety  Families, containing rive Hundred and four persons. The present inhabitants are  settled at Port Senior, they Subsist chiefly by the Fishery and by the Lumber  Trade, They have built Seventy Houses, have employed v Seventeen Schooners in  the Fishery and made about eight thousand Quintals of Fish besides which they  have made a considerable quantity of Shingles, Clapboards, Staves, and erected  a Saw mill for Sawing Boards. The Township comprehends the Lands lying on the  Ocean from Port Metway four miles west of the River, and Harbour of Port Senior  ; The Harbour is Barr'd having but Nine feet at low-water, but safe and  convenient within the River, and good Anchoring in three fathom ; The Country  and Soil much the same with Lunenburg, abounds more with Oak and some pine.  High and mountainous within Land.</p>
                    <p>The Lands lying westward from Liverpool to the Township of  Harrington eighteen Leagues are ungranted, except the Port of Port Roseway and  circumjacent Lands which were promised by the late Governor to Mr. McNutt, and  associates to be - preserved for a Township upon his procuring Settlers therefore  in a limited time ; This large Tract has at present no Inhabitants : There are  several Harbours for small Vessels, but no Ship Harbour except Port Mutton and  Port Roseway . This land is of the same kind of Soil and natural growth of  Timber as Liverpool.</p>
                    <p><strong>TOWNSHIP OF BARRINGTON</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Comprehends the Islands commonly called Cape Sable Harbour,  where formerly were settled twelve French Families who had improved about Two  Hundred Acres of Land, their principal subsistence was from the Cod Fishery and  Fur Trade.</p>
                    <p>The Lands in this Township are of the like quality as  Liverpool, with the same natural growth, except the Island called Cape Sable,  which is four Miles in length and two in breadth, Low Land, Soil Sandy and  Barren. The Harbour is very safe and convenient for Fishing Schooners and other  small Vessels. Their Township was granted 1760 to Two Hundred Proprietors, the  most part Fishermen, at Cape Cod Plymouth -' and Nantucket in New England ;  they began their Township this present year with about Twenty Families. A  Hundred more Families are preparing to remove in the Spring with their Vessels  to establish a Fishery, with an intermixture of some Farmers.</p>
                    <p>The Coast from Cape Sable to Long   Island is about twenty Leagues fronting the West. The principal  Harbours in this Tract are at Tobogue, a River and Harbour. This Tract is under  promise to a Number of Fishermen from Marblehead,  a Fishing Town  in New England, a few Families are come down and more  expected this Fall. They propose to complete their number to eighty Families in  the Spring, their principal design is for the Fishery most of the proprietors  being part Owners of Fishing Schooners.</p>
                    <p>Next adjoining is Pubnico and the Township   of Yarmouth, granted to two hundred  Proprietors, Farmers and Fishermen ; about twenty Families have removed and  settled with their Stock, and many others preparing to come in the Spring. In  this Township are a considerable number of Islands, called the Tuskot Islands,  well situated for the Boat Fishery, hereabout a dozen French Families lived  whose chief subsistence was raising Cattle, there being within the Islands and  on the River a considerable quantity of Salt Marsh ; the Soil of the same Nature  and like growth of Timber with the other Parts of the Coast already described.</p>
                    <p>To the Northward of Yarmouth is St. Mary's Bay, a very deep  Bay, full of Rocks and Shoals, shunned by all Navigators as very dangerous. The  Lands lying on both sides are high Mountainous and Rocky. The Shores inaccessible.</p>
                    <p>To the North of St. Mary's Bay is the Island  called Long Island and its Harbour. This Harbour was  frequented by all the French, being in the Bay of Fundy,  for the Cod Fishery during the Summer Season ; and it would be very  advantageous to these Settlements in time to come were this Harbour or Lands  about it reserved for a Fishery in Common.</p>
                    <p>About the whole Coast from Long Island to Cape Sable, and  thence East as far as Cape La Have, during all the Summer Season is a good Cod  Fishery, most of the Fishing Vessels from New England, not less than Two  Hundred Sail, catch their Summer Fairs , about these Coasts; and there is but  little doubt, as the Harbours about this Coast are much more handy and  convenient for the Fishery, that that Branch of Business will be transferred  from New England to this Coast in a few years.</p>
                    <p><strong>THE BAY OF FUNDY AND ITS SETTLEMENTS</strong>.</p>
                    <p>On the South side of the Bay of Fundy, from Long Island to  Cape Fondu, is a Chain of Mountains terminated by the Basin of Minas, inaccessible  on the Sea Coast, without any break except the Passage called Petite Passage  and the Gut of Annapolis ; the Gut of Annapolis is the Entrance to a fine large  Basin, eight Miles in length and four in breadth ; at the West end into this Basin  empties the River of Annapolis, Navigable for Capital Ships to the Foot of  Annapolis, and for small Vessels twenty Miles further.</p>
                    <p>On the North side of the Basin and River Annapolis is the Township   of Granville, , granted to One  hundred and fifty proprietors. This settlement began 1760, and Thirty Families  are now settled there. This Township contains about Fifteen Hundred Acres of  Marsh Lands and about One Thousand Acres of Cleared Upland, the principal part  of the Lands in this Township are high mountainous unimprovable Lands, all the  improvable Lands are those next to the River extending about a mile back to the  foot of the Mountains. The natural growth of Timber chiefly Spruce and Fir.</p>                    </td>

Several other Grants of the  Lands adjoining have been granted and dated to this Township, so that the whole  will consist of One Hundred and fifty proprietors or Shares. This Township  contains about Twenty five Hundred Acres of Marsh   Land, and three Thousand Acres of  cleared upland. The Proprietors having divided the cleared and improvable Land  into Lots it amounts to about Eighty Аcres to each Share, the other Parts of  the Township being the Termination of two long ranges of Mountains is broken  Mountains and Steep precipices, and mostly unimprovable Lands. These  Inhabitants have imported large Quantities of Cattle, and have this year cut  Hay sufficient for supporting them, but the excessive drought of the Summer has  blasted most of their Corn. The River Pisiquid running thro' this Township is  navigable for Sloops to all the Settlements, there being three Fathom at high  Water for Six Miles. The Town is situated in the Center of the Settlement. The  Woods having suffered at the sarre time with Minas, now Horton, the growth of  Timber is small of the same kind with Horton.</p></td>

                <p>This Township granted to Seventy proprietors began its  Settlement in 1761. The present Number of Families is Sixty, containing about  Two Hundred and forty persons ; they imported a sufficient Number Nt. Cattle  and have this Summer cut Hay sufficient for them. They have also raised a considerable  Quantity of English (¡rain, but not enough to subsist them, being cut Short by  the drought. They have but little improved Land in proportion to the other  Townships, it contains about One Thousand Acres of Marsh   Land, and Six hundred Acres of clear  Lands. This Township contains in proportion to its bigness a greater quantity  of improvable Lands than any of the fore- mentioned Townships. The Soil in  general is rich, and great part free from Stones. It is heavy Timber'd not  having suffered by Fire as the other neighboring Townships. Its natural growth  is Firr, Pine, Spruce, Oak, Beach, Birch, Ac. The River Conectcook [Kenetcook]  runs thro' the middle of this Township, navigable for Sloops at high Water for  Ten miles, and on the South-west end the River St. Croix, navigable four miles.</p>
                <p>To the Eastward of Newport on the Basin   of Cobequid and on the River  Subenaccada is a Tract of Land designed for two townships resolved by the late  Governor for Mr. McNutt and his Associates. This Tract of Land contains about  two Thousand Acres of Marsh and about one hundred of Cleared upland, most of  this Tract is improvable land, of a rich Soil and free from Stones, some part  is heavy Timbered and other parts having suffered by Fires have but a small  growth of Wood, not difficult to clear. The natural growth, Spruce, Pine,  Beach, Birch, Hemlock, Elm and several other Sorts. \</p>
                <p><strong>THE TOWNSHIP OF TRURO</strong>.</p>
                <p>This Township is bounded Northerly on the Basin   of Cobequid, and on the Township   of Onslow, Westerly  by the River Subenaccada East and South on ungranted Lands. These granted Lands  were settled this present year by Fifty three of the proprietors transported at  the Government's expence with their Stock consisting of One Hundred and  Seventeen Head of Cattle and Utensils for Fanning ; having met contrary winds  had a long passage and did not arrive till the Latter end of May ; their Crop  of Corn being Sowed late suffered by the Drought and was finally blasted by an  early Frost, they have rais'd potatoes and other Roots sufficient, have cut Hay  more than enough for the Stock, and to assist them in provision the Government  have lent them Six Hundred Bushels of Corn to be repaid when demanded. This  Tract of Land is for the most improvable Lands of a rich Soil, free from  Stones, contains fifteen Hundred Acres of Marsh, and One Hundred Acres of  Cleared Upland : is designed for One Hundred and fifty Families. The Wood Lands  in many places light Timbered where the Fires have prevailed formerly, in other  places very heavy Timbered : the Natural Growth are Spruce, Fir, Hemlock, Pine,  Beach, Birch, Maple, Ash with some oak. The Navigation very difficult, the  Tides very rapid, and the Channel empty for Nine Hours between Tides.</p>
                <p><strong>TOWNSHIP OF ONSLOW</strong>.</p>
                <p>This Township is situated opposite Truro on the North side  of Cobequid Basin This Settlement began this present year ; the Inhabitants are  transported at the public Expence ; their Number consists of Fifty two Families  and heads of Families, who brought with them One Hundred and Seventeen head of Neat  Cattle and Horses, they arrived the latter end of May, and set themselves  immediately to raise what corn they could for their Subsistence, but the  drought first, and an early Frost put an End to their Expectation. They have  raised roots sufficient, have cut Hay enough for their Stock, and the  Government to prevent their suffering for want of provisions have lent them  Eight Hundred Bushels of Corn to be repaid on demand. This Township contains  Fourteen Hundred Acres of Marsh, and Seventy Acres of clear upland, is designed  for One Hundred and Fifty Families. The Soil of the Wood   Land is rich Soil, and free from  Stones as far as the Mountains, about one half of this Township are improvable  Lands, the other Mountainous and Rocky. This Country has suffered formerly by  Fire the Trees small, and the Wood not difficult to clear, the Natural Growth  the same with Truro. </p>
                <p>The Lands lying west of Onslow extending from thence to Cape  Doree are Lands reserved for Mr. McNutt and associates ; this Tract of Lund  from this Township of Onslow to point Conomo being eighteen Miles are  considerable quantifies of Marsh, containing about two Thousand Acres Marsh and  about Five Hundred Acres of Cleared Land, the principal Settlement of the  French at Cobequid, proposed to be laid out into Two Townships. The first  Township next to Onslow, half the Lands are improvable the other mountainous  and unimprovable, the other Township will have One third improvable Lands ; at  present have no Inhabitants. The Natural Growth the same with Truro.  The other points from point Conomo [economy] to Cape   Doree hath about Five Hundred Acres  of Marsh Land,  the Land interspers'd with Mountains and Low Lands to be divided into Two  Townships about one Fourth improvable Lands the other Steep Rocky Mountains.  The natural Growth abounding more with Spruce and Firr, but a mixture of other  Wood as Beach, Birch, &lt;&amp;c.</p>
                <p>From Cape Chignecto to the Coal Mines the Lauds are  Mountainous, no place of embarkation but at Apple River, which is but an  indifferent Harbour, open to the North and North West Winds which are violent  winds. The Lands are covered with thick woods, Beach, Birch, Spruce and Fir,  ¿к.</p>
                <p>From the Coals to the Township   of Amherst is a Township reserved  by the late Governor for the Settling disbanded Soldiers. In this Township are  comprehended the Rivers Le Planch or the River aux Mines and the River Macan  oix the borders of these Rivers are very considerable Marshes, and on the Basin  of Chignecto containing about Ten Thousand Acres uf marsh Land with many small  Spotts of cleared upland ; the Lands of this Township are mostly improvable  Lands, the Marshes extend far into the Country along the Sides of the River.  The upland Country rising with a gentle ascent and those parts that have been  clear d by the French .appear to be Lands very tit for a granary, and for  mowing Lands, and yield good crops of English Hay ; of the same kind and Quality  are the Townships of Amherst, Cumberland, Sackville, Memrimcook and the East  side of Patcootyeak [PetitcodiacJ, some containing more, others a less Quantity  of Marsh Lands. The Marsh next the Basin and Sea have been dik'd and drain'd by  the French Inhabitants and were improved by them, but the Dykes are universally  leveled and scarcely the Traces of them appear. Those Marshes that lye towards  the heads of Rivers are for the most part covered with the Fresh Water, having  never been drained or in any sort improved. The Upland is in general of the  same kind of Soil and rich Loom and covered with the same kind of Timber Trees,  such as Beach, Birch, Ash, Spruce, Firr and Pine. This Country of Cumberland  when fully peopled and all the Marshes improved will be the granary of Nova  ¡Scotia.</p>

                <p>The Township of Cumberland and Sackville, only have any  Settlement ; at Cumberland about Thirty-five Families, and at Sackville  Twenty-five Families, the other Grantees for these two Townships propose  Settling in the ensuing Spring, many having been down to make preparations by  building for the reception of their Families : the Grantees of Amherst refuse,  settling unless they can have transportation of their Stock at the expence of  the Government.</p>
                <p>The Lands lying on the West of the River of Patiostyeak have  very considerable Marshes at the Turns of the River, interspersed with  improvable uplands which extend from the River about the distance of two miles,  in some places more, in others less, and the same at Chipodée, but the Inlands  are mountainous rocky and barren, they extend as far as St. John's River ; the  Coast from C'hepodé to St. John's River is mountainous, Steep Shoars, and no  place of Imbarkation, the River St. John's is navigable for small Vessels to  St, Ann's, about Twenty Leagues, where the French had a pitched Fort and kept a  Party of Soldiers till the Fort at the Mouth of the River was taken possession  of by General Monckton. Upon his approach with the English Troops they quitted  both Forts and retired to Canady. About Twenty French Families only lived at  St. Ann's till the French Acadians were removed out of the Peninsula, and then  a considerable number tied here for refuge, where they continued till General  Monckton's arrival ; about Ten Leagues above the mouth of the River the Lands  are improvable and from thence to St. Ann's great part of the borders of the  River are Interval Lands, overflow'd in the Spring of the Year by the  Freshetts. There have been no Improvements but at St. Aim's, where about Six  Hundred Acres of Land have been clear'd, no Marshes on this River. The natural  growth of the Upland is Spruce, Fir,  Pine, Beach, and the Intervalls, Elm, Oak, Ash, Maple, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>West of St. John's River about three Leagues is a harbour  for small Vessels called Musquash Cove and a River—here lived about a dozen  French Families who subsisted chiefly by a Trade with the Indians, very little  Improvements of Land from thence to Le Proc [Lepreau] about six leagues the  coast is inaccessible ; Point Le Proc forms the Eastern Point of the Bay of  Passamaquody ; This is a large Bay full of Islands, under cover of which are  several Commodious Harbours for Fishing Vessels within this Bay is the River  St. Croix, the Western Boundaries of Sir William Alexander's Grant of the Lands  called Nova Scotia, the Lands bordering upon this Bay and on the River St.  Croix as well as most of the Islands are good improveable Lands. The Harbours  are conveniently situated for the Summer Cod Fishery. The Natural produce are  Spruce, Pine, Firr, Ash, Beach, Birch &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The Lands lying West from hence to Penobscot   River are full of Bays, Islands and  Harbours and but little known to any but Indian Traders. This Tract from the  River St. Croix to Georges, a Settlement in New England was esteemed by the French  part of Acadia, and so called by the French Inhabitants, and one of the  Dependances on Port Royal now Annapolis ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht to the  Crown of Great Britain.</p>
                <p><strong>LANDS ON THE GULF   OF ST. LAWRENCE</strong>.</p>
                <p>There was a Settlement of the French at the Bay of Gaspee  for carrying on the Fishery, the Inhabitants were removed after the Reduction  of Louisburg ; The Country about this Bay is Mountainous a long range call'd  the Lady Mountains extending from Gaspe reach within a few Leagues at Quebec.  The Coast from thence to the Bay of Verte has several Bays and Rivers emptying  into the Gulf with convenient Harbours for small Vessels ; This Part of the  Country is little known to the English, it having been the Retreat of the  French Aeadians who have supported themselves by depredations made on the  Provision Vessels bound from the Continent to Quebec ; This Coast having been  well guarded this Year by His Majesty's Ships, both Indians and Acadians have  been driven to great distress, The former have this Summer sent their Chiefs  and made their Submission to the Government, and near Two Hundred of the  Acadians have come in and submitted but many still keep out. As there are  convenient Ports, and several Rivers navigable for small Vessels abounding with  Salmon, and as the Sea Coast  abounds with Cod Fish, this part of Nova Scotia  may in time be settled.</p>
                <p>Bay Verte was the Port of Embarkation for the French Troops,  and Stores when they were in possession of Beausejour ; 'Tis an open Bay and  Shoal, Ships cannot come nearer then three Leagues, the embarkation is made  with Boats and Small Vessels. Tide rises about Six feet; The Townships of  Cumberland and Amherst extend from the Basin   of Chignecto to this Bay.</p>
                <p>From the Bay Verte to Ramsheek is Twenty Seven Miles, no place  of Embarkation, Ramsheek was a small French Settlement not above three Families  who followed the Fishery, very little improvement of Land, a Harbour for small  Craft, from thence to Tatmagoush is three miles across Land, here is an  indifferent good Harbour, a very convenient Port for a Communication with St.  John's Island, it being but Seven Leagues from this Port, to Port Joye in St.  John's Island. The Soil is good, here lived about a dozen French Families who  have made some considerable Improvements, which will be useful to begin a  Settlement ; it is well situated for the Cod and Whale Fishery, which last in  the Summer Season abound in the Bay, taking their Rout, as I conceive from the  Southern Ocean, thro' the straits of Belle Isle into the Northern Sea ; Several  Vessels from New England have this summer met with good Success in that Fishery  in the Gulph and at the mouth of Canada River ; An advantageous Settlement  might be made at this Port, as the Lands in general are good, the Roads nre now  open'd thro' the Woods from this Port to Halifax, from whence it is distant as  the Roads runs Ninety Miles.</p>
                <p>From Tatmagoush to the Gut of Canso no Harbour, but a good  Road under the Isle Poitee.  No Inhabitants ever settled in this part of the Country, and consequently no  kind of Improvement. South of the Gut of Canso is Chida Couch. This is a large  Bay three Leagues over, the French attempted a Settlement at the Bottom of this  Bay but it proved unsuccessful in Improvements.</p>
                <p>South of Chidabucto lyes Cape Canso and the Islands  about it, being the South eastermost promontary of the Peninsula   of Nova Scotia. The Islands of  Canso form an Indifferent good Harbour, it is a port in high esteem among all  the Fishermen of New England ; a Block house was erected here in 1722, and a  Guard kept to secure the Fishermen from the Depradations of the Indians. This  drew a Vast Concourse of Fishing Schooners from New England  in 17'25. Above two Hundred Schooners made their Fish, and above Twenty Topsail  Vessels were loaded here with Fish for Spain and Portugal, and were the like  Encouragement given for the protection of Fishermen, there's not the least  doubt but it would in a year or two be restored to as much as formerly,  application having been made from New England, for that and would be a great  means of inducing and promoting a Settlement on the main Land. It is in the  Center of the most frequented Banks for Fishery.</p>
                <p>From Canso to Lawrence   Town are several good ports for  Shipping but at present known only to Coasters. The Lands are indifferent in  general, being rocky, principally low Spruce and Fir but notwithstanding are  intermixed with good improvable Lands. All the Ports lying Eastward of Halifax  are better Situated for the Fishery than the Ports to the Westward, the Cod  coming sooner upon the Banks in the Spring. Fish are caught off the Isle of  Sable Bank, and the Banks East of Canso and West end of the Grand Bank of Newfoundland.  As to the Inland parts of the Peninsula, as far as ]  have had opportunity of seeing them, they are much broken into Mountains and  Lakes which are Innumerable.</p>
                <p>On the Settlement of the Province   of Nova Scotia with British  Subjects depends the Security of the Fishery both in Newfoundland  and New England; but many other advantages may accrue to  Great Britain  upon the increase of its Inhabitants, which will appear from the following  observations.</p>
                <p><strong>DEALS, &amp;c.</strong></p>
                <p>From the foregoing description of the Natural growth of  Timber on the Lands of Nova Scotia, it appears that in every Township there  will be found great quantities of Spruce, Fir, Pine and other Species for  Masts, Spars, Deals, «.tc., and considering the extent of Nova Scotia being  from Three Hundred Miles from East to West, and as many North and South there  will be found a sufficient Quantity to supply Great Britain with all those  Materials for Ages to come. Great part of the Supplies of those Commodities are  brought to Great Britain in foreign Bottoms, and the Freight and purchase paid  for principally in cash, and not with British Manufacture ; and therefore a  disadvantageous Trade. The difficulties at present of transferring this Channel  of Trade to the Plantations is the want of a sufficient Number of Hands to fell  the Timber and saw into Boards, and the distance of the Place, and consequently  a longer Voyage and higher Freight : to remedy this last, if an additional Duty  was laid on Deals so as to make the Freight equal, as for instance.</p>
                <p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty on Deals is 28s p. 100, equal to 1,000 feet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – ₤1&nbsp; 8 0<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freight of 100 Deals from Norway  and and the Baltic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – ₤3 &nbsp;0 0<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supposed additional Duty 12s p. 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – ₤&nbsp; 12 0<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - £5&nbsp; 0 0</p>
                <p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freight from Nova Scotia,  50s p. Ton, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;0 0<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 of Deals of 1,000 feet equal to Two Tons.</p>
                <p>This would leave the first purchase of Deals equal at the  place of Shipping, but the great number of Streams fit for erecting Saw-mills  abounding in every part of the Province   of Nova Scotia. The Timber in the  greatest plenty near to those Streams, nothing would be wanted but a sufficient  number of Hands to furnish Great Britain with those Commodities with this  advantage, That their own Ships to the great increase of the British  navigation, would be employed, and the original purchase made with British  Manufactures. There is already Fifteen Saw Mills built and building in the New  Townships, which in a year or two will cut deals more than sufficient for their  own Consumption ; as the Colony is daily increasing and there is the greatest  probability of having large Embarkations of Protestants from the North of  Ireland, this business would not only be a ready means of giving many of them a  speedy Subsistance but greatly assist them in clearing the Wood Land to  cultivate for the support of their Stock. In the mean time such a duty would  increase the public Revenue.</p>
                <p><strong>POT ASH.</strong></p>
                <p>Nova Scotia  abounding also in Beach, Birch, Ash, &amp;c., whose Ashes upon repeated Trials  have been found to contain a greater Quantity of Salts than the Timber growing  in the Southern Colonies, the Pot Ash manufactory might be carried on with  great success here. As in this manufacture great Quantities of Wood are  consumed in melting and refining the Salts, as an encouragement to the erecting  of proper Furnaces and to keep them with a sufficient Stock of Wood a Thousand  Acres ought to be destined to each Furnace which I conceive would be a good  Inducement to Gentlemen of ability to erect them in every Township for a proper  Furnace with building necessary for Walts, and to store the ashes will cost the  proprietor at least Three Hundred Pounds Sterling. This would be a Singular  advantage to the New Settler who would find immediate employment for his Subsistence  and pay for the Labour of clearing his own Lands, and furnish Great    Britain with the material in exchange for  her own manufactures which she now purchases with Cash.</p>
                <p><strong>HEMP.</strong></p>
                <p>The raising of Hemp in the Southern Colonies has fail'd  principally from the excessive Heats of the Summer which Stunt it and prevents  its growing to a suitable Length nor could they ever bring it to a proper  growth but in grounds strongly manured, and thick sown, which forced up early  by the great quantity of Dung has shaded the Lands, from the excessive heats.  Hut the Air of this province being more moderate in the Summer and more subject  to Rain anil Damps from the Seas surrounding it, there is great Reason to hope,  This useful material will succeed here, few essays have been made here thro'  the Scarcity of Seed, but what has been sowed, has been on upland without manure,  and has grown this Summer, (tho' uncommonly dry) to 'the height of eight and  ten feet, the Inhabitants lately arrived from Ireland are of opinion that the  natural Soil of this Country is sufficiently rich to produce it in great Quantity  without manure. </p>
