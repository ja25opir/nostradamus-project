<h2>CRATYLUS</h2>
<br>by Plato
<br>Translated by Benjamin Jowett
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p><p>The Cratylus has always been a source of perplexity to the student of
<br>Plato.&nbsp; While in fancy and humour, and perfection of style and metaphysical
<br>originality, this dialogue may be ranked with the best of the Platonic
<br>writings, there has been an uncertainty about the motive of the piece,
<br>which interpreters have hitherto not succeeded in dispelling.&nbsp;
We need not
<br>suppose that Plato used words in order to conceal his thoughts, or
that he
<br>would have been unintelligible to an educated contemporary.&nbsp; In
the
<br>Phaedrus and Euthydemus we also find a difficulty in determining the
<br>precise aim of the author.&nbsp; Plato wrote satires in the form of
dialogues,
<br>and his meaning, like that of other satirical writers, has often slept
in
<br>the ear of posterity.&nbsp; Two causes may be assigned for this obscurity:&nbsp;
1st,
<br>the subtlety and allusiveness of this species of composition; 2nd,
the
<br>difficulty of reproducing a state of life and literature which has
passed
<br>away.&nbsp; A satire is unmeaning unless we can place ourselves back
among the
<br>persons and thoughts of the age in which it was written.&nbsp; Had
the treatise
<br>of Antisthenes upon words, or the speculations of Cratylus, or some
other
<br>Heracleitean of the fourth century B.C., on the nature of language
been
<br>preserved to us; or if we had lived at the time, and been 'rich enough
to
<br>attend the fifty-drachma course of Prodicus,' we should have understood
<br>Plato better, and many points which are now attributed to the extravagance
<br>of Socrates' humour would have been found, like the allusions of
<br>Aristophanes in the Clouds, to have gone home to the sophists and
<br>grammarians of the day.
</p><p>For the age was very busy with philological speculation; and many questions
<br>were beginning to be asked about language which were parallel to other
<br>questions about justice, virtue, knowledge, and were illustrated in
a
<br>similar manner by the analogy of the arts.&nbsp; Was there a correctness
in
<br>words, and were they given by nature or convention?&nbsp; In the presocratic
<br>philosophy mankind had been striving to attain an expression of their
<br>ideas, and now they were beginning to ask themselves whether the expression
<br>might not be distinguished from the idea?&nbsp; They were also seeking
to
<br>distinguish the parts of speech and to enquire into the relation of
subject
<br>and predicate.&nbsp; Grammar and logic were moving about somewhere
in the depths
<br>of the human soul, but they were not yet awakened into consciousness
and
<br>had not found names for themselves, or terms by which they might be
<br>expressed.&nbsp; Of these beginnings of the study of language we know
little,
<br>and there necessarily arises an obscurity when the surroundings of
such a
<br>work as the Cratylus are taken away.&nbsp; Moreover, in this, as in
most of the
<br>dialogues of Plato, allowance has to be made for the character of Socrates.
<br>For the theory of language can only be propounded by him in a manner
which
<br>is consistent with his own profession of ignorance.&nbsp; Hence his
ridicule of
<br>the new school of etymology is interspersed with many declarations
'that he
<br>knows nothing,' 'that he has learned from Euthyphro,' and the like.&nbsp;
Even
<br>the truest things which he says are depreciated by himself.&nbsp; He
professes
<br>to be guessing, but the guesses of Plato are better than all the other
<br>theories of the ancients respecting language put together.
</p><p>The dialogue hardly derives any light from Plato's other writings, and
<br>still less from Scholiasts and Neoplatonist writers.&nbsp; Socrates
must be
<br>interpreted from himself, and on first reading we certainly have a
<br>difficulty in understanding his drift, or his relation to the two other
<br>interlocutors in the dialogue.&nbsp; Does he agree with Cratylus or
with
<br>Hermogenes, and is he serious in those fanciful etymologies, extending
over
<br>more than half the dialogue, which he seems so greatly to relish?&nbsp;
Or is he
<br>serious in part only; and can we separate his jest from his earnest?--Sunt
<br>bona, sunt quaedum mediocria, sunt mala plura.&nbsp; Most of them are
<br>ridiculously bad, and yet among them are found, as if by accident,
<br>principles of philology which are unsurpassed in any ancient writer,
and
<br>even in advance of any philologer of the last century.&nbsp; May we
suppose that
<br>Plato, like Lucian, has been amusing his fancy by writing a comedy
in the
<br>form of a prose dialogue?&nbsp; And what is the final result of the
enquiry?&nbsp; Is
<br>Plato an upholder of the conventional theory of language, which he
<br>acknowledges to be imperfect? or does he mean to imply that a perfect
<br>language can only be based on his own theory of ideas?&nbsp; Or if
this latter
<br>explanation is refuted by his silence, then in what relation does his
<br>account of language stand to the rest of his philosophy?&nbsp; Or may
we be so
<br>bold as to deny the connexion between them?&nbsp; (For the allusion
to the ideas
<br>at the end of the dialogue is merely intended to show that we must
not put
<br>words in the place of things or realities, which is a thesis strongly
<br>insisted on by Plato in many other passages)...These are some of the
first
<br>thoughts which arise in the mind of the reader of the Cratylus.&nbsp;
And the
<br>consideration of them may form a convenient introduction to the general
<br>subject of the dialogue.
</p><p>We must not expect all the parts of a dialogue of Plato to tend equally
to
<br>some clearly-defined end.&nbsp; His idea of literary art is not the
absolute
<br>proportion of the whole, such as we appear to find in a Greek temple
or
<br>statue; nor should his works be tried by any such standard.&nbsp; They
have
<br>often the beauty of poetry, but they have also the freedom of conversation.
<br>'Words are more plastic than wax' (Rep.), and may be moulded into any
form.
<br>He wanders on from one topic to another, careless of the unity of his
work,
<br>not fearing any 'judge, or spectator, who may recall him to the point'
<br>(Theat.), 'whither the argument blows we follow' (Rep.).&nbsp; To have
<br>determined beforehand, as in a modern didactic treatise, the nature
and
<br>limits of the subject, would have been fatal to the spirit of enquiry
or
<br>discovery, which is the soul of the dialogue...These remarks are applicable
<br>to nearly all the works of Plato, but to the Cratylus and Phaedrus
more
<br>than any others.&nbsp; See Phaedrus, Introduction.
</p><p>There is another aspect under which some of the dialogues of Plato may
be
<br>more truly viewed:--they are dramatic sketches of an argument.&nbsp;
We have
<br>found that in the Lysis, Charmides, Laches, Protagoras, Meno, we arrived
at
<br>no conclusion--the different sides of the argument were personified
in the
<br>different speakers; but the victory was not distinctly attributed to
any of
<br>them, nor the truth wholly the property of any.&nbsp; And in the Cratylus
we
<br>have no reason to assume that Socrates is either wholly right or wholly
<br>wrong, or that Plato, though he evidently inclines to him, had any
other
<br>aim than that of personifying, in the characters of Hermogenes, Socrates,
<br>and Cratylus, the three theories of language which are respectively
<br>maintained by them.
</p><p>The two subordinate persons of the dialogue, Hermogenes and Cratylus,
are
<br>at the opposite poles of the argument.&nbsp; But after a while the
disciple of
<br>the Sophist and the follower of Heracleitus are found to be not so
far
<br>removed from one another as at first sight appeared; and both show
an
<br>inclination to accept the third view which Socrates interposes between
<br>them.&nbsp; First, Hermogenes, the poor brother of the rich Callias,
expounds
<br>the doctrine that names are conventional; like the names of slaves,
they
<br>may be given and altered at pleasure.&nbsp; This is one of those principles
<br>which, whether applied to society or language, explains everything
and
<br>nothing.&nbsp; For in all things there is an element of convention;
but the
<br>admission of this does not help us to understand the rational ground
or
<br>basis in human nature on which the convention proceeds.&nbsp; Socrates
first of
<br>all intimates to Hermogenes that his view of language is only a part
of a
<br>sophistical whole, and ultimately tends to abolish the distinction
between
<br>truth and falsehood.&nbsp; Hermogenes is very ready to throw aside
the
<br>sophistical tenet, and listens with a sort of half admiration, half
belief,
<br>to the speculations of Socrates.
</p><p>Cratylus is of opinion that a name is either a true name or not a name
at
<br>all.&nbsp; He is unable to conceive of degrees of imitation; a word
is either
<br>the perfect expression of a thing, or a mere inarticulate sound (a
fallacy
<br>which is still prevalent among theorizers about the origin of language).
<br>He is at once a philosopher and a sophist; for while wanting to rest
<br>language on an immutable basis, he would deny the possibility of falsehood.
<br>He is inclined to derive all truth from language, and in language he
sees
<br>reflected the philosophy of Heracleitus.&nbsp; His views are not like
those of
<br>Hermogenes, hastily taken up, but are said to be the result of mature
<br>consideration, although he is described as still a young man.&nbsp;
With a
<br>tenacity characteristic of the Heracleitean philosophers, he clings
to the
<br>doctrine of the flux.&nbsp; (Compare Theaet.)&nbsp; Of the real Cratylus
we know
<br>nothing, except that he is recorded by Aristotle to have been the friend
or
<br>teacher of Plato; nor have we any proof that he resembled the likeness
of
<br>him in Plato any more than the Critias of Plato is like the real Critias,
<br>or the Euthyphro in this dialogue like the other Euthyphro, the diviner,
in
<br>the dialogue which is called after him.
</p><p>Between these two extremes, which have both of them a sophistical
<br>character, the view of Socrates is introduced, which is in a manner
the
<br>union of the two.&nbsp; Language is conventional and also natural,
and the true
<br>conventional-natural is the rational.&nbsp; It is a work not of chance,
but of
<br>art; the dialectician is the artificer of words, and the legislator
gives
<br>authority to them.&nbsp; They are the expressions or imitations in
sound of
<br>things.&nbsp; In a sense, Cratylus is right in saying that things have
by nature
<br>names; for nature is not opposed either to art or to law.&nbsp; But
vocal
<br>imitation, like any other copy, may be imperfectly executed; and in
this
<br>way an element of chance or convention enters in.&nbsp; There is much
which is
<br>accidental or exceptional in language.&nbsp; Some words have had their
original
<br>meaning so obscured, that they require to be helped out by convention.&nbsp;
But
<br>still the true name is that which has a natural meaning.&nbsp; Thus
nature, art,
<br>chance, all combine in the formation of language.&nbsp; And the three
views
<br>respectively propounded by Hermogenes, Socrates, Cratylus, may be described
<br>as the conventional, the artificial or rational, and the natural.&nbsp;
The view
<br>of Socrates is the meeting-point of the other two, just as conceptualism
is
<br>the meeting-point of nominalism and realism.
</p><p>We can hardly say that Plato was aware of the truth, that 'languages
are
<br>not made, but grow.'&nbsp; But still, when he says that 'the legislator
made
<br>language with the dialectician standing on his right hand,' we need
not
<br>infer from this that he conceived words, like coins, to be issued from
the
<br>mint of the State.&nbsp; The creator of laws and of social life is
naturally
<br>regarded as the creator of language, according to Hellenic notions,
and the
<br>philosopher is his natural advisor.&nbsp; We are not to suppose that
the
<br>legislator is performing any extraordinary function; he is merely the
<br>Eponymus of the State, who prescribes rules for the dialectician and
for
<br>all other artists.&nbsp; According to a truly Platonic mode of approaching
the
<br>subject, language, like virtue in the Republic, is examined by the
analogy
<br>of the arts.&nbsp; Words are works of art which may be equally made
in different
<br>materials, and are well made when they have a meaning.&nbsp; Of the
process
<br>which he thus describes, Plato had probably no very definite notion.&nbsp;
But
<br>he means to express generally that language is the product of intelligence,
<br>and that languages belong to States and not to individuals.
</p><p>A better conception of language could not have been formed in Plato's
age,
<br>than that which he attributes to Socrates.&nbsp; Yet many persons have
thought
<br>that the mind of Plato is more truly seen in the vague realism of Cratylus.
<br>This misconception has probably arisen from two causes:&nbsp; first,
the desire
<br>to bring Plato's theory of language into accordance with the received
<br>doctrine of the Platonic ideas; secondly, the impression created by
<br>Socrates himself, that he is not in earnest, and is only indulging
the
<br>fancy of the hour.
</p><p>1.&nbsp; We shall have occasion to show more at length, in the Introduction
to
<br>future dialogues, that the so-called Platonic ideas are only a semi-
<br>mythical form, in which he attempts to realize abstractions, and that
they
<br>are replaced in his later writings by a rational theory of psychology.
<br>(See introductions to the Meno and the Sophist.)&nbsp; And in the Cratylus
he
<br>gives a general account of the nature and origin of language, in which
Adam
<br>Smith, Rousseau, and other writers of the last century, would have
<br>substantially agreed.&nbsp; At the end of the dialogue, he speaks as
in the
<br>Symposium and Republic of absolute beauty and good; but he never supposed
<br>that they were capable of being embodied in words.&nbsp; Of the names
of the
<br>ideas, he would have said, as he says of the names of the Gods, that
we
<br>know nothing.&nbsp; Even the realism of Cratylus is not based upon
the ideas of
<br>Plato, but upon the flux of Heracleitus.&nbsp; Here, as in the Sophist
and
<br>Politicus, Plato expressly draws attention to the want of agreement
in
<br>words and things.&nbsp; Hence we are led to infer, that the view of
Socrates is
<br>not the less Plato's own, because not based upon the ideas; 2nd, that
<br>Plato's theory of language is not inconsistent with the rest of his
<br>philosophy.
</p><p>2.&nbsp; We do not deny that Socrates is partly in jest and partly in
earnest.
<br>He is discoursing in a high-flown vein, which may be compared to the
<br>'dithyrambics of the Phaedrus.'&nbsp; They are mysteries of which he
is
<br>speaking, and he professes a kind of ludicrous fear of his imaginary
<br>wisdom.&nbsp; When he is arguing out of Homer, about the names of Hector's
son,
<br>or when he describes himself as inspired or maddened by Euthyphro,
with
<br>whom he has been sitting from the early dawn (compare Phaedrus and
Lysias;
<br>Phaedr.) and expresses his intention of yielding to the illusion to-day,
<br>and to-morrow he will go to a priest and be purified, we easily see
that
<br>his words are not to be taken seriously.&nbsp; In this part of the
dialogue his
<br>dread of committing impiety, the pretended derivation of his wisdom
from
<br>another, the extravagance of some of his etymologies, and, in general,
the
<br>manner in which the fun, fast and furious, vires acquirit eundo, remind
us
<br>strongly of the Phaedrus.&nbsp; The jest is a long one, extending over
more than
<br>half the dialogue.&nbsp; But then, we remember that the Euthydemus
is a still
<br>longer jest, in which the irony is preserved to the very end.&nbsp;
There he is
<br>parodying the ingenious follies of early logic; in the Cratylus he
is
<br>ridiculing the fancies of a new school of sophists and grammarians.&nbsp;
The
<br>fallacies of the Euthydemus are still retained at the end of our logic
<br>books; and the etymologies of the Cratylus have also found their way
into
<br>later writers.&nbsp; Some of these are not much worse than the conjectures
of
<br>Hemsterhuis, and other critics of the last century; but this does not
prove
<br>that they are serious.&nbsp; For Plato is in advance of his age in
his
<br>conception of language, as much as he is in his conception of mythology.
<br>(Compare Phaedrus.)
</p><p>When the fervour of his etymological enthusiasm has abated, Socrates
ends,
<br>as he has begun, with a rational explanation of language.&nbsp; Still
he
<br>preserves his 'know nothing' disguise, and himself declares his first
<br>notions about names to be reckless and ridiculous.&nbsp; Having explained
<br>compound words by resolving them into their original elements, he now
<br>proceeds to analyse simple words into the letters of which they are
<br>composed.&nbsp; The Socrates who 'knows nothing,' here passes into
the teacher,
<br>the dialectician, the arranger of species.&nbsp; There is nothing in
this part
<br>of the dialogue which is either weak or extravagant.&nbsp; Plato is
a supporter
<br>of the Onomatopoetic theory of language; that is to say, he supposes
words
<br>to be formed by the imitation of ideas in sounds; he also recognises
the
<br>effect of time, the influence of foreign languages, the desire of euphony,
<br>to be formative principles; and he admits a certain element of chance.&nbsp;
But
<br>he gives no imitation in all this that he is preparing the way for
the
<br>construction of an ideal language.&nbsp; Or that he has any Eleatic
speculation
<br>to oppose to the Heracleiteanism of Cratylus.
</p><p>The theory of language which is propounded in the Cratylus is in accordance
<br>with the later phase of the philosophy of Plato, and would have been
<br>regarded by him as in the main true.&nbsp; The dialogue is also a satire
on the
<br>philological fancies of the day.&nbsp; Socrates in pursuit of his vocation
as a
<br>detector of false knowledge, lights by accident on the truth.&nbsp;
He is
<br>guessing, he is dreaming; he has heard, as he says in the Phaedrus,
from
<br>another:&nbsp; no one is more surprised than himself at his own discoveries.
<br>And yet some of his best remarks, as for example his view of the derivation
<br>of Greek words from other languages, or of the permutations of letters,
or
<br>again, his observation that in speaking of the Gods we are only speaking
of
<br>our names of them, occur among these flights of humour.
</p><p>We can imagine a character having a profound insight into the nature
of men
<br>and things, and yet hardly dwelling upon them seriously; blending
<br>inextricably sense and nonsense; sometimes enveloping in a blaze of
jests
<br>the most serious matters, and then again allowing the truth to peer
<br>through; enjoying the flow of his own humour, and puzzling mankind
by an
<br>ironical exaggeration of their absurdities.&nbsp; Such were Aristophanes
and
<br>Rabelais; such, in a different style, were Sterne, Jean Paul, Hamann,--
<br>writers who sometimes become unintelligible through the extravagance
of
<br>their fancies.&nbsp; Such is the character which Plato intends to depict
in some
<br>of his dialogues as the Silenus Socrates; and through this medium we
have
<br>to receive our theory of language.
</p><p>There remains a difficulty which seems to demand a more exact answer:&nbsp;
In
<br>what relation does the satirical or etymological portion of the dialogue
<br>stand to the serious?&nbsp; Granting all that can be said about the
provoking
<br>irony of Socrates, about the parody of Euthyphro, or Prodicus, or
<br>Antisthenes, how does the long catalogue of etymologies furnish any
answer
<br>to the question of Hermogenes, which is evidently the main thesis of
the
<br>dialogue:&nbsp; What is the truth, or correctness, or principle of
names?
</p><p>After illustrating the nature of correctness by the analogy of the arts,
<br>and then, as in the Republic, ironically appealing to the authority
of the
<br>Homeric poems, Socrates shows that the truth or correctness of names
can
<br>only be ascertained by an appeal to etymology.&nbsp; The truth of names
is to be
<br>found in the analysis of their elements.&nbsp; But why does he admit
etymologies
<br>which are absurd, based on Heracleitean fancies, fourfold interpretations
<br>of words, impossible unions and separations of syllables and letters?
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The answer to this difficulty has been already anticipated
in part:
<br>Socrates is not a dogmatic teacher, and therefore he puts on this wild
and
<br>fanciful disguise, in order that the truth may be permitted to appear:&nbsp;
2.
<br>as Benfey remarks, an erroneous example may illustrate a principle
of
<br>language as well as a true one:&nbsp; 3. many of these etymologies,
as, for
<br>example, that of dikaion, are indicated, by the manner in which Socrates
<br>speaks of them, to have been current in his own age:&nbsp; 4. the philosophy
of
<br>language had not made such progress as would have justified Plato in
<br>propounding real derivations.&nbsp; Like his master Socrates, he saw
through the
<br>hollowness of the incipient sciences of the day, and tries to move
in a
<br>circle apart from them, laying down the conditions under which they
are to
<br>be pursued, but, as in the Timaeus, cautious and tentative, when he
is
<br>speaking of actual phenomena.&nbsp; To have made etymologies seriously,
would
<br>have seemed to him like the interpretation of the myths in the Phaedrus,
<br>the task 'of a not very fortunate individual, who had a great deal
of time
<br>on his hands.'&nbsp; The irony of Socrates places him above and beyond
the
<br>errors of his contemporaries.
</p><p>The Cratylus is full of humour and satirical touches:&nbsp; the inspiration
<br>which comes from Euthyphro, and his prancing steeds, the light admixture
of
<br>quotations from Homer, and the spurious dialectic which is applied
to them;
<br>the jest about the fifty-drachma course of Prodicus, which is declared
on
<br>the best authority, viz. his own, to be a complete education in grammar
and
<br>rhetoric; the double explanation of the name Hermogenes, either as
'not
<br>being in luck,' or 'being no speaker;' the dearly-bought wisdom of
Callias,
<br>the Lacedaemonian whose name was 'Rush,' and, above all, the pleasure
which
<br>Socrates expresses in his own dangerous discoveries, which 'to-morrow
he
<br>will purge away,' are truly humorous.&nbsp; While delivering a lecture
on the
<br>philosophy of language, Socrates is also satirizing the endless fertility
<br>of the human mind in spinning arguments out of nothing, and employing
the
<br>most trifling and fanciful analogies in support of a theory.&nbsp;
Etymology in
<br>ancient as in modern times was a favourite recreation; and Socrates
makes
<br>merry at the expense of the etymologists.&nbsp; The simplicity of Hermogenes,
<br>who is ready to believe anything that he is told, heightens the effect.
<br>Socrates in his genial and ironical mood hits right and left at his
<br>adversaries:&nbsp; Ouranos is so called apo tou oran ta ano, which,
as some
<br>philosophers say, is the way to have a pure mind; the sophists are
by a
<br>fanciful explanation converted into heroes; 'the givers of names were
like
<br>some philosophers who fancy that the earth goes round because their
heads
<br>are always going round.'&nbsp; There is a great deal of 'mischief'
lurking in
<br>the following:&nbsp; 'I found myself in greater perplexity about justice
than I
<br>was before I began to learn;'&nbsp; 'The rho in katoptron must be the
addition
<br>of some one who cares nothing about truth, but thinks only of putting
the
<br>mouth into shape;'&nbsp; 'Tales and falsehoods have generally to do
with the
<br>Tragic and goatish life, and tragedy is the place of them.'&nbsp; Several
<br>philosophers and sophists are mentioned by name:&nbsp; first, Protagoras
and
<br>Euthydemus are assailed; then the interpreters of Homer, oi palaioi
<br>Omerikoi (compare Arist. Met.) and the Orphic poets are alluded to
by the
<br>way; then he discovers a hive of wisdom in the philosophy of Heracleitus;--
<br>the doctrine of the flux is contained in the word ousia (= osia the
pushing
<br>principle), an anticipation of Anaxagoras is found in psuche and selene.
<br>Again, he ridicules the arbitrary methods of pulling out and putting
in
<br>letters which were in vogue among the philologers of his time; or slightly
<br>scoffs at contemporary religious beliefs.&nbsp; Lastly, he is impatient
of
<br>hearing from the half-converted Cratylus the doctrine that falsehood
can
<br>neither be spoken, nor uttered, nor addressed; a piece of sophistry
<br>attributed to Gorgias, which reappears in the Sophist.&nbsp; And he
proceeds to
<br>demolish, with no less delight than he had set up, the Heracleitean
theory
<br>of language.
</p><p>In the latter part of the dialogue Socrates becomes more serious, though
he
<br>does not lay aside but rather aggravates his banter of the Heracleiteans,
<br>whom here, as in the Theaetetus, he delights to ridicule.&nbsp; What
was the
<br>origin of this enmity we can hardly determine:--was it due to the natural
<br>dislike which may be supposed to exist between the 'patrons of the
flux'
<br>and the 'friends of the ideas' (Soph.)? or is it to be attributed to
the
<br>indignation which Plato felt at having wasted his time upon 'Cratylus
and
<br>the doctrines of Heracleitus' in the days of his youth?&nbsp; Socrates,
touching
<br>on some of the characteristic difficulties of early Greek philosophy,
<br>endeavours to show Cratylus that imitation may be partial or imperfect,
<br>that a knowledge of things is higher than a knowledge of names, and
that
<br>there can be no knowledge if all things are in a state of transition.&nbsp;
But
<br>Cratylus, who does not easily apprehend the argument from common sense,
<br>remains unconvinced, and on the whole inclines to his former opinion.&nbsp;
Some
<br>profound philosophical remarks are scattered up and down, admitting
of an
<br>application not only to language but to knowledge generally; such as
the
<br>assertion that 'consistency is no test of truth:' or again, 'If we
are
<br>over-precise about words, truth will say "too late" to us as to the
belated
<br>traveller in Aegina.'
</p><p>The place of the dialogue in the series cannot be determined with
<br>certainty.&nbsp; The style and subject, and the treatment of the character
of
<br>Socrates, have a close resemblance to the earlier dialogues, especially
to
<br>the Phaedrus and Euthydemus.&nbsp; The manner in which the ideas are
spoken of
<br>at the end of the dialogue, also indicates a comparatively early date.&nbsp;
The
<br>imaginative element is still in full vigour; the Socrates of the Cratylus
<br>is the Socrates of the Apology and Symposium, not yet Platonized; and
he
<br>describes, as in the Theaetetus, the philosophy of Heracleitus by
<br>'unsavoury' similes--he cannot believe that the world is like 'a leaky
<br>vessel,' or 'a man who has a running at the nose'; he attributes the
flux
<br>of the world to the swimming in some folks' heads.&nbsp; On the other
hand, the
<br>relation of thought to language is omitted here, but is treated of
in the
<br>Sophist.&nbsp; These grounds are not sufficient to enable us to arrive
at a
<br>precise conclusion.&nbsp; But we shall not be far wrong in placing
the Cratylus
<br>about the middle, or at any rate in the first half, of the series.
</p><p>Cratylus, the Heracleitean philosopher, and Hermogenes, the brother
of
<br>Callias, have been arguing about names; the former maintaining that
they
<br>are natural, the latter that they are conventional.&nbsp; Cratylus
affirms that
<br>his own is a true name, but will not allow that the name of Hermogenes
is
<br>equally true.&nbsp; Hermogenes asks Socrates to explain to him what
Cratylus
<br>means; or, far rather, he would like to know, What Socrates himself
thinks
<br>about the truth or correctness of names?&nbsp; Socrates replies, that
hard is
<br>knowledge, and the nature of names is a considerable part of knowledge:&nbsp;
he
<br>has never been to hear the fifty-drachma course of Prodicus; and having
<br>only attended the single-drachma course, he is not competent to give
an
<br>opinion on such matters.&nbsp; When Cratylus denies that Hermogenes
is a true
<br>name, he supposes him to mean that he is not a true son of Hermes,
because
<br>he is never in luck.&nbsp; But he would like to have an open council
and to hear
<br>both sides.
</p><p>Hermogenes is of opinion that there is no principle in names; they may
be
<br>changed, as we change the names of slaves, whenever we please, and
the
<br>altered name is as good as the original one.
</p><p>You mean to say, for instance, rejoins Socrates, that if I agree to
call a
<br>man a horse, then a man will be rightly called a horse by me, and a
man by
<br>the rest of the world?&nbsp; But, surely, there is in words a true
and a false,
<br>as there are true and false propositions.&nbsp; If a whole proposition
be true
<br>or false, then the parts of a proposition may be true or false, and
the
<br>least parts as well as the greatest; and the least parts are names,
and
<br>therefore names may be true or false.&nbsp; Would Hermogenes maintain
that
<br>anybody may give a name to anything, and as many names as he pleases;
and
<br>would all these names be always true at the time of giving them?
<br>Hermogenes replies that this is the only way in which he can conceive
that
<br>names are correct; and he appeals to the practice of different nations,
and
<br>of the different Hellenic tribes, in confirmation of his view.&nbsp;
Socrates
<br>asks, whether the things differ as the words which represent them differ:--
<br>Are we to maintain with Protagoras, that what appears is?&nbsp; Hermogenes
has
<br>always been puzzled about this, but acknowledges, when he is pressed
by
<br>Socrates, that there are a few very good men in the world, and a great
many
<br>very bad; and the very good are the wise, and the very bad are the
foolish;
<br>and this is not mere appearance but reality.&nbsp; Nor is he disposed
to say
<br>with Euthydemus, that all things equally and always belong to all men;
in
<br>that case, again, there would be no distinction between bad and good
men.
<br>But then, the only remaining possibility is, that all things have their
<br>several distinct natures, and are independent of our notions about
them.
<br>And not only things, but actions, have distinct natures, and are done
by
<br>different processes.&nbsp; There is a natural way of cutting or burning,
and a
<br>natural instrument with which men cut or burn, and any other way will
<br>fail;--this is true of all actions.&nbsp; And speaking is a kind of
action, and
<br>naming is a kind of speaking, and we must name according to a natural
<br>process, and with a proper instrument.&nbsp; We cut with a knife, we
pierce with
<br>an awl, we weave with a shuttle, we name with a name.&nbsp; And as
a shuttle
<br>separates the warp from the woof, so a name distinguishes the natures
of
<br>things.&nbsp; The weaver will use the shuttle well,--that is, like
a weaver; and
<br>the teacher will use the name well,--that is, like a teacher.&nbsp;
The shuttle
<br>will be made by the carpenter; the awl by the smith or skilled person.&nbsp;
But
<br>who makes a name?&nbsp; Does not the law give names, and does not the
teacher
<br>receive them from the legislator?&nbsp; He is the skilled person who
makes them,
<br>and of all skilled workmen he is the rarest.&nbsp; But how does the
carpenter
<br>make or repair the shuttle, and to what will he look?&nbsp; Will he
not look at
<br>the ideal which he has in his mind?&nbsp; And as the different kinds
of work
<br>differ, so ought the instruments which make them to differ.&nbsp; The
several
<br>kinds of shuttles ought to answer in material and form to the several
kinds
<br>of webs.&nbsp; And the legislator ought to know the different materials
and
<br>forms of which names are made in Hellas and other countries.&nbsp;
But who is to
<br>be the judge of the proper form?&nbsp; The judge of shuttles is the
weaver who
<br>uses them; the judge of lyres is the player of the lyre; the judge
of ships
<br>is the pilot.&nbsp; And will not the judge who is able to direct the
legislator
<br>in his work of naming, be he who knows how to use the names--he who
can ask
<br>and answer questions--in short, the dialectician?&nbsp; The pilot directs
the
<br>carpenter how to make the rudder, and the dialectician directs the
<br>legislator how he is to impose names; for to express the ideal forms
of
<br>things in syllables and letters is not the easy task, Hermogenes, which
you
<br>imagine.
</p><p>'I should be more readily persuaded, if you would show me this natural
<br>correctness of names.'
</p><p>Indeed I cannot; but I see that you have advanced; for you now admit
that
<br>there is a correctness of names, and that not every one can give a
name.
<br>But what is the nature of this correctness or truth, you must learn
from
<br>the Sophists, of whom your brother Callias has bought his reputation
for
<br>wisdom rather dearly; and since they require to be paid, you, having
no
<br>money, had better learn from him at second-hand.&nbsp; 'Well, but I
have just
<br>given up Protagoras, and I should be inconsistent in going to learn
of
<br>him.'&nbsp; Then if you reject him you may learn of the poets, and
in particular
<br>of Homer, who distinguishes the names given by Gods and men to the
same
<br>things, as in the verse about the river God who fought with Hephaestus,
<br>'whom the Gods call Xanthus, and men call Scamander;' or in the lines
in
<br>which he mentions the bird which the Gods call 'Chalcis,' and men
<br>'Cymindis;' or the hill which men call 'Batieia,' and the Gods 'Myrinna's
<br>Tomb.'&nbsp; Here is an important lesson; for the Gods must of course
be right
<br>in their use of names.&nbsp; And this is not the only truth about philology
<br>which may be learnt from Homer.&nbsp; Does he not say that Hector's
son had two
<br>names--
</p><p>'Hector called him Scamandrius, but the others Astyanax'?
</p><p>Now, if the men called him Astyanax, is it not probable that the other
name
<br>was conferred by the women?&nbsp; And which are more likely to be right--the
<br>wiser or the less wise, the men or the women?&nbsp; Homer evidently
agreed with
<br>the men:&nbsp; and of the name given by them he offers an explanation;--the
boy
<br>was called Astyanax ('king of the city'), because his father saved
the
<br>city.&nbsp; The names Astyanax and Hector, moreover, are really the
same,--the
<br>one means a king, and the other is 'a holder or possessor.'&nbsp; For
as the
<br>lion's whelp may be called a lion, or the horse's foal a foal, so the
son
<br>of a king may be called a king.&nbsp; But if the horse had produced
a calf, then
<br>that would be called a calf.&nbsp; Whether the syllables of a name
are the same
<br>or not makes no difference, provided the meaning is retained.&nbsp;
For example;
<br>the names of letters, whether vowels or consonants, do not correspond
to
<br>their sounds, with the exception of epsilon, upsilon, omicron, omega.&nbsp;
The
<br>name Beta has three letters added to the sound--and yet this does not
alter
<br>the sense of the word, or prevent the whole name having the value which
the
<br>legislator intended.&nbsp; And the same may be said of a king and the
son of a
<br>king, who like other animals resemble each other in the course of nature;
<br>the words by which they are signified may be disguised, and yet amid
<br>differences of sound the etymologist may recognise the same notion,
just as
<br>the physician recognises the power of the same drugs under different
<br>disguises of colour and smell.&nbsp; Hector and Astyanax have only
one letter
<br>alike, but they have the same meaning; and Agis (leader) is altogether
<br>different in sound from Polemarchus (chief in war), or Eupolemus (good
<br>warrior); but the two words present the same idea of leader or general,
<br>like the words Iatrocles and Acesimbrotus, which equally denote a
<br>physician.&nbsp; The son succeeds the father as the foal succeeds the
horse, but
<br>when, out of the course of nature, a prodigy occurs, and the offspring
no
<br>longer resembles the parent, then the names no longer agree.&nbsp;
This may be
<br>illustrated by the case of Agamemnon and his son Orestes, of whom the
<br>former has a name significant of his patience at the siege of Troy;
while
<br>the name of the latter indicates his savage, man-of-the-mountain nature.
<br>Atreus again, for his murder of Chrysippus, and his cruelty to Thyestes,
is
<br>rightly named Atreus, which, to the eye of the etymologist, is ateros
<br>(destructive), ateires (stubborn), atreotos (fearless); and Pelops
is o ta
<br>pelas oron (he who sees what is near only), because in his eagerness
to win
<br>Hippodamia, he was unconscious of the remoter consequences which the
murder
<br>of Myrtilus would entail upon his race.&nbsp; The name Tantalus, if
slightly
<br>changed, offers two etymologies; either apo tes tou lithou talanteias,
or
<br>apo tou talantaton einai, signifying at once the hanging of the stone
over
<br>his head in the world below, and the misery which he brought upon his
<br>country.&nbsp; And the name of his father, Zeus, Dios, Zenos, has an
excellent
<br>meaning, though hard to be understood, because really a sentence which
is
<br>divided into two parts (Zeus, Dios).&nbsp; For he, being the lord and
king of
<br>all, is the author of our being, and in him all live:&nbsp; this is
implied in
<br>the double form, Dios, Zenos, which being put together and interpreted
is
<br>di on ze panta.&nbsp; There may, at first sight, appear to be some
irreverence
<br>in calling him the son of Cronos, who is a proverb for stupidity; but
the
<br>meaning is that Zeus himself is the son of a mighty intellect; Kronos,
<br>quasi koros, not in the sense of a youth, but quasi to katharon kai
<br>akeraton tou nou--the pure and garnished mind, which in turn is begotten
of
<br>Uranus, who is so called apo tou oran ta ano, from looking upwards;
which,
<br>as philosophers say, is the way to have a pure mind.&nbsp; The earlier
portion
<br>of Hesiod's genealogy has escaped my memory, or I would try more
<br>conclusions of the same sort.&nbsp; 'You talk like an oracle.'&nbsp;
I caught the
<br>infection from Euthyphro, who gave me a long lecture which began at
dawn,
<br>and has not only entered into my ears, but filled my soul, and my intention
<br>is to yield to the inspiration to-day; and to-morrow I will be exorcised
by
<br>some priest or sophist.&nbsp; 'Go on; I am anxious to hear the rest.'&nbsp;
Now that
<br>we have a general notion, how shall we proceed?&nbsp; What names will
afford the
<br>most crucial test of natural fitness?&nbsp; Those of heroes and ordinary
men are
<br>often deceptive, because they are patronymics or expressions of a wish;
let
<br>us try gods and demi-gods.&nbsp; Gods are so called, apo tou thein,
from the
<br>verb 'to run;' because the sun, moon, and stars run about the heaven;
and
<br>they being the original gods of the Hellenes, as they still are of
the
<br>Barbarians, their name is given to all Gods.&nbsp; The demons are the
golden
<br>race of Hesiod, and by golden he means not literally golden, but good;
and
<br>they are called demons, quasi daemones, which in old Attic was used
for
<br>daimones--good men are well said to become daimones when they die,
because
<br>they are knowing.&nbsp; Eros (with an epsilon) is the same word as
eros (with an
<br>eta):&nbsp; 'the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
fair;' or
<br>perhaps they were a species of sophists or rhetoricians, and so called
apo
<br>tou erotan, or eirein, from their habit of spinning questions; for
eirein
<br>is equivalent to legein.&nbsp; I get all this from Euthyphro; and now
a new and
<br>ingenious idea comes into my mind, and, if I am not careful, I shall
be
<br>wiser than I ought to be by to-morrow's dawn.&nbsp; My idea is, that
we may put
<br>in and pull out letters at pleasure and alter the accents (as, for
example,
<br>Dii philos may be turned into Diphilos), and we may make words into
<br>sentences and sentences into words.&nbsp; The name anthrotos is a case
in point,
<br>for a letter has been omitted and the accent changed; the original
meaning
<br>being o anathron a opopen--he who looks up at what he sees.&nbsp; Psuche
may be
<br>thought to be the reviving, or refreshing, or animating principle--e
<br>anapsuchousa to soma; but I am afraid that Euthyphro and his disciples
will
<br>scorn this derivation, and I must find another:&nbsp; shall we identify
the soul
<br>with the 'ordering mind' of Anaxagoras, and say that psuche, quasi
phuseche
<br>= e phusin echei or ochei?--this might easily be refined into psyche.
<br>'That is a more artistic etymology.'
</p><p>After psuche follows soma; this, by a slight permutation, may be either
=
<br>(1) the 'grave' of the soul, or (2) may mean 'that by which the soul
<br>signifies (semainei) her wishes.'&nbsp; But more probably, the word
is Orphic,
<br>and simply denotes that the body is the place of ward in which the
soul
<br>suffers the penalty of sin,--en o sozetai.&nbsp; 'I should like to
hear some
<br>more explanations of the names of the Gods, like that excellent one
of
<br>Zeus.'&nbsp; The truest names of the Gods are those which they give
themselves;
<br>but these are unknown to us.&nbsp; Less true are those by which we
propitiate
<br>them, as men say in prayers, 'May he graciously receive any name by
which I
<br>call him.'&nbsp; And to avoid offence, I should like to let them know
beforehand
<br>that we are not presuming to enquire about them, but only about the
names
<br>which they usually bear.&nbsp; Let us begin with Hestia.&nbsp; What
did he mean who
<br>gave the name Hestia?&nbsp; 'That is a very difficult question.'&nbsp;
O, my dear
<br>Hermogenes, I believe that there was a power of philosophy and talk
among
<br>the first inventors of names, both in our own and in other languages;
for
<br>even in foreign words a principle is discernible.&nbsp; Hestia is the
same with
<br>esia, which is an old form of ousia, and means the first principle
of
<br>things:&nbsp; this agrees with the fact that to Hestia the first sacrifices
are
<br>offered.&nbsp; There is also another reading--osia, which implies that
'pushing'
<br>(othoun) is the first principle of all things.&nbsp; And here I seem
to discover
<br>a delicate allusion to the flux of Heracleitus--that antediluvian
<br>philosopher who cannot walk twice in the same stream; and this flux
of his
<br>may accomplish yet greater marvels.&nbsp; For the names Cronos and
Rhea cannot
<br>have been accidental; the giver of them must have known something about
the
<br>doctrine of Heracleitus.&nbsp; Moreover, there is a remarkable coincidence
in
<br>the words of Hesiod, when he speaks of Oceanus, 'the origin of Gods;'
and
<br>in the verse of Orpheus, in which he describes Oceanus espousing his
sister
<br>Tethys.&nbsp; Tethys is nothing more than the name of a spring--to
diattomenon
<br>kai ethoumenon.&nbsp; Poseidon is posidesmos, the chain of the feet,
because you
<br>cannot walk on the sea--the epsilon is inserted by way of ornament;
or
<br>perhaps the name may have been originally polleidon, meaning, that
the God
<br>knew many things (polla eidos):&nbsp; he may also be the shaker, apo
tou
<br>seiein,--in this case, pi and delta have been added.&nbsp; Pluto is
connected
<br>with ploutos, because wealth comes out of the earth; or the word may
be a
<br>euphemism for Hades, which is usually derived apo tou aeidous, because
the
<br>God is concerned with the invisible.&nbsp; But the name Hades was really
given
<br>him from his knowing (eidenai) all good things.&nbsp; Men in general
are
<br>foolishly afraid of him, and talk with horror of the world below from
which
<br>no one may return.&nbsp; The reason why his subjects never wish to
come back,
<br>even if they could, is that the God enchains them by the strongest
of
<br>spells, namely by the desire of virtue, which they hope to obtain by
<br>constant association with him.&nbsp; He is the perfect and accomplished
Sophist
<br>and the great benefactor of the other world; for he has much more than
he
<br>wants there, and hence he is called Pluto or the rich.&nbsp; He will
have
<br>nothing to do with the souls of men while in the body, because he cannot
<br>work his will with them so long as they are confused and entangled
by
<br>fleshly lusts.&nbsp; Demeter is the mother and giver of food--e didousa
meter
<br>tes edodes.&nbsp; Here is erate tis, or perhaps the legislator may
have been
<br>thinking of the weather, and has merely transposed the letters of the
word
<br>aer.&nbsp; Pherephatta, that word of awe, is pheretapha, which is only
an
<br>euphonious contraction of e tou pheromenou ephaptomene,--all things
are in
<br>motion, and she in her wisdom moves with them, and the wise God Hades
<br>consorts with her--there is nothing very terrible in this, any more
than in
<br>the her other appellation Persephone, which is also significant of
her
<br>wisdom (sophe).&nbsp; Apollo is another name, which is supposed to
have some
<br>dreadful meaning, but is susceptible of at least four perfectly innocent
<br>explanations.&nbsp; First, he is the purifier or purger or absolver
(apolouon);
<br>secondly, he is the true diviner, Aplos, as he is called in the Thessalian
<br>dialect (aplos = aplous, sincere); thirdly, he is the archer (aei ballon),
<br>always shooting; or again, supposing alpha to mean ama or omou, Apollo
<br>becomes equivalent to ama polon, which points to both his musical and
his
<br>heavenly attributes; for there is a 'moving together' alike in music
and in
<br>the harmony of the spheres.&nbsp; The second lambda is inserted in
order to
<br>avoid the ill-omened sound of destruction.&nbsp; The Muses are so called--apo
<br>tou mosthai.&nbsp; The gentle Leto or Letho is named from her willingness
<br>(ethelemon), or because she is ready to forgive and forget (lethe).
<br>Artemis is so called from her healthy well-balanced nature, dia to
artemes,
<br>or as aretes istor; or as a lover of virginity, aroton misesasa.&nbsp;
One of
<br>these explanations is probably true,--perhaps all of them.&nbsp; Dionysus
is o
<br>didous ton oinon, and oinos is quasi oionous because wine makes those
think
<br>(oiesthai) that they have a mind (nous) who have none.&nbsp; The established
<br>derivation of Aphrodite dia ten tou athrou genesin may be accepted
on the
<br>authority of Hesiod.&nbsp; Again, there is the name of Pallas, or Athene,
which
<br>we, who are Athenians, must not forget.&nbsp; Pallas is derived from
armed
<br>dances--apo tou pallein ta opla.&nbsp; For Athene we must turn to the
<br>allegorical interpreters of Homer, who make the name equivalent to
theonoe,
<br>or possibly the word was originally ethonoe and signified moral
<br>intelligence (en ethei noesis).&nbsp; Hephaestus, again, is the lord
of light--o
<br>tou phaeos istor.&nbsp; This is a good notion; and, to prevent any
other getting
<br>into our heads, let us go on to Ares.&nbsp; He is the manly one (arren),
or the
<br>unchangeable one (arratos).&nbsp; Enough of the Gods; for, by the Gods,
I am
<br>afraid of them; but if you suggest other words, you will see how the
horses
<br>of Euthyphro prance.&nbsp; 'Only one more God; tell me about my godfather
<br>Hermes.'&nbsp; He is ermeneus, the messenger or cheater or thief or
bargainer;
<br>or o eirein momenos, that is, eiremes or ermes--the speaker or contriver
of
<br>speeches.&nbsp; 'Well said Cratylus, then, that I am no son of Hermes.'&nbsp;
Pan, as
<br>the son of Hermes, is speech or the brother of speech, and is called
Pan
<br>because speech indicates everything--o pan menuon.&nbsp; He has two
forms, a
<br>true and a false; and is in the upper part smooth, and in the lower
part
<br>shaggy.&nbsp; He is the goat of Tragedy, in which there are plenty
of
<br>falsehoods.
</p><p>'Will you go on to the elements--sun, moon, stars, earth, aether, air,
<br>fire, water, seasons, years?'&nbsp; Very good:&nbsp; and which shall
I take first?
<br>Let us begin with elios, or the sun.&nbsp; The Doric form elios helps
us to see
<br>that he is so called because at his rising he gathers (alizei) men
<br>together, or because he rolls about (eilei) the earth, or because he
<br>variegates (aiolei = poikillei) the earth.&nbsp; Selene is an anticipation
of
<br>Anaxagoras, being a contraction of selaenoneoaeia, the light (selas)
which
<br>is ever old and new, and which, as Anaxagoras says, is borrowed from
the
<br>sun; the name was harmonized into selanaia, a form which is still in
use.
<br>'That is a true dithyrambic name.'&nbsp; Meis is so called apo tou
meiousthai,
<br>from suffering diminution, and astron is from astrape (lightning),
which is
<br>an improvement of anastrope, that which turns the eyes inside out.&nbsp;
'How do
<br>you explain pur n udor?'&nbsp; I suspect that pur, which, like udor
n kuon, is
<br>found in Phrygian, is a foreign word; for the Hellenes have borrowed
much
<br>from the barbarians, and I always resort to this theory of a foreign
origin
<br>when I am at a loss.&nbsp; Aer may be explained, oti airei ta apo tes
ges; or,
<br>oti aei rei; or, oti pneuma ex autou ginetai (compare the poetic word
<br>aetai).&nbsp; So aither quasi aeitheer oti aei thei peri ton aera:&nbsp;
ge, gaia
<br>quasi genneteira (compare the Homeric form gegaasi); ora (with an omega),
<br>or, according to the old Attic form ora (with an omicron), is derived
apo
<br>tou orizein, because it divides the year; eniautos and etos are the
same
<br>thought--o en eauto etazon, cut into two parts, en eauto and etazon,
like
<br>di on ze into Dios and Zenos.
</p><p>'You make surprising progress.'&nbsp; True; I am run away with, and
am not even
<br>yet at my utmost speed.&nbsp; 'I should like very much to hear your
account of
<br>the virtues.&nbsp; What principle of correctness is there in those
charming
<br>words, wisdom, understanding, justice, and the rest?'&nbsp; To explain
all that
<br>will be a serious business; still, as I have put on the lion's skin,
<br>appearances must be maintained.&nbsp; My opinion is, that primitive
men were
<br>like some modern philosophers, who, by always going round in their
search
<br>after the nature of things, become dizzy; and this phenomenon, which
was
<br>really in themselves, they imagined to take place in the external world.
<br>You have no doubt remarked, that the doctrine of the universal flux,
or
<br>generation of things, is indicated in names.&nbsp; 'No, I never did.'&nbsp;
Phronesis
<br>is only phoras kai rou noesis, or perhaps phoras onesis, and in any
case is
<br>connected with pheresthai; gnome is gones skepsis kai nomesis; noesis
is
<br>neou or gignomenon esis; the word neos implies that creation is always
<br>going on--the original form was neoesis; sophrosune is soteria phroneseos;
<br>episteme is e epomene tois pragmasin--the faculty which keeps close,
<br>neither anticipating nor lagging behind; sunesis is equivalent to sunienai,
<br>sumporeuesthai ten psuche, and is a kind of conclusion--sullogismos
tis,
<br>akin therefore in idea to episteme; sophia is very difficult, and has
a
<br>foreign look--the meaning is, touching the motion or stream of things,
and
<br>may be illustrated by the poetical esuthe and the Lacedaemonian proper
name
<br>Sous, or Rush; agathon is ro agaston en te tachuteti,--for all things
are
<br>in motion, and some are swifter than others:&nbsp; dikaiosune is clearly
e tou
<br>dikaiou sunesis.&nbsp; The word dikaion is more troublesome, and appears
to mean
<br>the subtle penetrating power which, as the lovers of motion say, preserves
<br>all things, and is the cause of all things, quasi diaion going through--the
<br>letter kappa being inserted for the sake of euphony.&nbsp; This is
a great
<br>mystery which has been confided to me; but when I ask for an explanation
I
<br>am thought obtrusive, and another derivation is proposed to me.&nbsp;
Justice is
<br>said to be o kaion, or the sun; and when I joyfully repeat this beautiful
<br>notion, I am answered, 'What, is there no justice when the sun is down?'
<br>And when I entreat my questioner to tell me his own opinion, he replies,
<br>that justice is fire in the abstract, or heat in the abstract; which
is not
<br>very intelligible.&nbsp; Others laugh at such notions, and say with
Anaxagoras,
<br>that justice is the ordering mind.&nbsp; 'I think that some one must
have told
<br>you this.'&nbsp; And not the rest?&nbsp; Let me proceed then, in the
hope of proving
<br>to you my originality.&nbsp; Andreia is quasi anpeia quasi e ano roe,
the stream
<br>which flows upwards, and is opposed to injustice, which clearly hinders
the
<br>principle of penetration; arren and aner have a similar derivation;
gune is
<br>the same as gone; thelu is derived apo tes theles, because the teat
makes
<br>things flourish (tethelenai), and the word thallein itself implies
increase
<br>of youth, which is swift and sudden ever (thein and allesthai).&nbsp;
I am
<br>getting over the ground fast:&nbsp; but much has still to be explained.&nbsp;
There
<br>is techne, for instance.&nbsp; This, by an aphaeresis of tau and an
epenthesis
<br>of omicron in two places, may be identified with echonoe, and signifies
<br>'that which has mind.'
</p><p>'A very poor etymology.'&nbsp; Yes; but you must remember that all language
is
<br>in process of change; letters are taken in and put out for the sake
of
<br>euphony, and time is also a great alterer of words.&nbsp; For example,
what
<br>business has the letter rho in the word katoptron, or the letter sigma
in
<br>the word sphigx?&nbsp; The additions are often such that it is impossible
to
<br>make out the original word; and yet, if you may put in and pull out,
as you
<br>like, any name is equally good for any object.&nbsp; The fact is, that
great
<br>dictators of literature like yourself should observe the rules of
<br>moderation.&nbsp; 'I will do my best.'&nbsp; But do not be too much
of a precisian,
<br>or you will paralyze me.&nbsp; If you will let me add mechane, apo
tou mekous,
<br>which means polu, and anein, I shall be at the summit of my powers,
from
<br>which elevation I will examine the two words kakia and arete.&nbsp;
The first is
<br>easily explained in accordance with what has preceded; for all things
being
<br>in a flux, kakia is to kakos ion.&nbsp; This derivation is illustrated
by the
<br>word deilia, which ought to have come after andreia, and may be regarded
as
<br>o lian desmos tes psuches, just as aporia signifies an impediment to
motion
<br>(from alpha not, and poreuesthai to go), and arete is euporia, which
is the
<br>opposite of this--the everflowing (aei reousa or aeireite), or the
<br>eligible, quasi airete.&nbsp; You will think that I am inventing, but
I say that
<br>if kakia is right, then arete is also right.&nbsp; But what is kakon?&nbsp;
That is a
<br>very obscure word, to which I can only apply my old notion and declare
that
<br>kakon is a foreign word.&nbsp; Next, let us proceed to kalon, aischron.&nbsp;
The
<br>latter is doubtless contracted from aeischoroun, quasi aei ischon roun.
<br>The inventor of words being a patron of the flux, was a great enemy
to
<br>stagnation.&nbsp; Kalon is to kaloun ta pragmata--this is mind (nous
or
<br>dianoia); which is also the principle of beauty; and which doing the
works
<br>of beauty, is therefore rightly called the beautiful.&nbsp; The meaning
of
<br>sumpheron is explained by previous examples;--like episteme, signifying
<br>that the soul moves in harmony with the world (sumphora, sumpheronta).
<br>Kerdos is to pasi kerannumenon--that which mingles with all things:
<br>lusiteloun is equivalent to to tes phoras luon to telos, and is not
to be
<br>taken in the vulgar sense of gainful, but rather in that of swift,
being
<br>the principle which makes motion immortal and unceasing; ophelimon
is apo
<br>tou ophellein--that which gives increase:&nbsp; this word, which is
Homeric, is
<br>of foreign origin.&nbsp; Blaberon is to blamton or boulomenon aptein
tou rou--
<br>that which injures or seeks to bind the stream.&nbsp; The proper word
would be
<br>boulapteroun, but this is too much of a mouthful--like a prelude on
the
<br>flute in honour of Athene.&nbsp; The word zemiodes is difficult; great
changes,
<br>as I was saying, have been made in words, and even a small change will
<br>alter their meaning very much.&nbsp; The word deon is one of these
disguised
<br>words.&nbsp; You know that according to the old pronunciation, which
is
<br>especially affected by the women, who are great conservatives, iota
and
<br>delta were used where we should now use eta and zeta:&nbsp; for example,
what we
<br>now call emera was formerly called imera; and this shows the meaning
of the
<br>word to have been 'the desired one coming after night,' and not, as
is
<br>often supposed, 'that which makes things gentle' (emera).&nbsp; So
again, zugon
<br>is duogon, quasi desis duein eis agogen--(the binding of two together
for
<br>the purpose of drawing.&nbsp; Deon, as ordinarily written, has an evil
sense,
<br>signifying the chain (desmos) or hindrance of motion; but in its ancient
<br>form dion is expressive of good, quasi diion, that which penetrates
or goes
<br>through all.&nbsp; Zemiodes is really demiodes, and means that which
binds
<br>motion (dounti to ion):&nbsp; edone is e pros ten onrsin teinousa praxis--the
<br>delta is an insertion:&nbsp; lupe is derived apo tes dialuseos tou
somatos: ania
<br>is from alpha and ienai, to go:&nbsp; algedon is a foreign word, and
is so
<br>called apo tou algeinou:&nbsp; odune is apo tes enduseos tes lupes:&nbsp;
achthedon
<br>is in its very sound a burden:&nbsp; chapa expresses the flow of soul:&nbsp;
terpsis
<br>is apo tou terpnou, and terpnon is properly erpnon, because the sensation
<br>of pleasure is likened to a breath (pnoe) which creeps (erpei) through
the
<br>soul:&nbsp; euphrosune is named from pheresthai, because the soul moves
in
<br>harmony with nature:&nbsp; epithumia is e epi ton thumon iousa dunamis:&nbsp;
thumos
<br>is apo tes thuseos tes psuches:&nbsp; imeros--oti eimenos pei e psuche:&nbsp;
pothos,
<br>the desire which is in another place, allothi pou:&nbsp; eros was anciently
<br>esros, and so called because it flows into (esrei) the soul from without:
<br>doxa is e dioxis tou eidenai, or expresses the shooting from a bow
(toxon).
<br>The latter etymology is confirmed by the words boulesthai, boule, aboulia,
<br>which all have to do with shooting (bole):&nbsp; and similarly oiesis
is nothing
<br>but the movement (oisis) of the soul towards essence.&nbsp; Ekousion
is to
<br>eikon--the yielding--anagke is e an agke iousa, the passage through
ravines
<br>which impede motion:&nbsp; aletheia is theia ale, divine motion.&nbsp;
Pseudos is the
<br>opposite of this, implying the principle of constraint and forced repose,
<br>which is expressed under the figure of sleep, to eudon; the psi is
an
<br>addition.&nbsp; Onoma, a name, affirms the real existence of that which
is
<br>sought after--on ou masma estin.&nbsp; On and ousia are only ion with
an iota
<br>broken off; and ouk on is ouk ion.&nbsp; 'And what are ion, reon, doun?'&nbsp;
One
<br>way of explaining them has been already suggested--they may be of foreign
<br>origin; and possibly this is the true answer.&nbsp; But mere antiquity
may often
<br>prevent our recognizing words, after all the complications which they
have
<br>undergone; and we must remember that however far we carry back our
analysis
<br>some ultimate elements or roots will remain which can be no further
<br>analyzed.&nbsp; For example; the word agathos was supposed by us to
be a
<br>compound of agastos and thoos, and probably thoos may be further
<br>resolvable.&nbsp; But if we take a word of which no further resolution
seems
<br>attainable, we may fairly conclude that we have reached one of these
<br>original elements, and the truth of such a word must be tested by some
new
<br>method.&nbsp; Will you help me in the search?
</p><p>All names, whether primary or secondary, are intended to show the nature
of
<br>things; and the secondary, as I conceive, derive their significance
from
<br>the primary.&nbsp; But then, how do the primary names indicate anything?&nbsp;
And
<br>let me ask another question,--If we had no faculty of speech, how should
we
<br>communicate with one another?&nbsp; Should we not use signs, like the
deaf and
<br>dumb?&nbsp; The elevation of our hands would mean lightness--heaviness
would be
<br>expressed by letting them drop.&nbsp; The running of any animal would
be
<br>described by a similar movement of our own frames.&nbsp; The body can
only
<br>express anything by imitation; and the tongue or mouth can imitate
as well
<br>as the rest of the body.&nbsp; But this imitation of the tongue or
voice is not
<br>yet a name, because people may imitate sheep or goats without naming
them.
<br>What, then, is a name?&nbsp; In the first place, a name is not a musical,
or,
<br>secondly, a pictorial imitation, but an imitation of that kind which
<br>expresses the nature of a thing; and is the invention not of a musician,
or
<br>of a painter, but of a namer.
</p><p>And now, I think that we may consider the names about which you were
<br>asking.&nbsp; The way to analyze them will be by going back to the
letters, or
<br>primary elements of which they are composed.&nbsp; First, we separate
the
<br>alphabet into classes of letters, distinguishing the consonants, mutes,
<br>vowels, and semivowels; and when we have learnt them singly, we shall
learn
<br>to know them in their various combinations of two or more letters;
just as
<br>the painter knows how to use either a single colour, or a combination
of
<br>colours.&nbsp; And like the painter, we may apply letters to the expression
of
<br>objects, and form them into syllables; and these again into words,
until
<br>the picture or figure--that is, language--is completed.&nbsp; Not that
I am
<br>literally speaking of ourselves, but I mean to say that this was the
way in
<br>which the ancients framed language.&nbsp; And this leads me to consider
whether
<br>the primary as well as the secondary elements are rightly given.&nbsp;
I may
<br>remark, as I was saying about the Gods, that we can only attain to
<br>conjecture of them.&nbsp; But still we insist that ours is the true
and only
<br>method of discovery; otherwise we must have recourse, like the tragic
<br>poets, to a Deus ex machina, and say that God gave the first names,
and
<br>therefore they are right; or that the barbarians are older than we
are, and
<br>that we learnt of them; or that antiquity has cast a veil over the
truth.
<br>Yet all these are not reasons; they are only ingenious excuses for
having
<br>no reasons.
</p><p>I will freely impart to you my own notions, though they are somewhat
<br>crude:--the letter rho appears to me to be the general instrument which
the
<br>legislator has employed to express all motion or kinesis.&nbsp; (I
ought to
<br>explain that kinesis is just iesis (going), for the letter eta was
unknown
<br>to the ancients; and the root, kiein, is a foreign form of ienai:&nbsp;
of
<br>kinesis or eisis, the opposite is stasis).&nbsp; This use of rho is
evident in
<br>the words tremble, break, crush, crumble, and the like; the imposer
of
<br>names perceived that the tongue is most agitated in the pronunciation
of
<br>this letter, just as he used iota to express the subtle power which
<br>penetrates through all things.&nbsp; The letters phi, psi, sigma, zeta,
which
<br>require a great deal of wind, are employed in the imitation of such
notions
<br>as shivering, seething, shaking, and in general of what is windy.&nbsp;
The
<br>letters delta and tau convey the idea of binding and rest in a place:&nbsp;
the
<br>lambda denotes smoothness, as in the words slip, sleek, sleep, and
the
<br>like.&nbsp; But when the slipping tongue is detained by the heavier
sound of
<br>gamma, then arises the notion of a glutinous clammy nature:&nbsp; nu
is sounded
<br>from within, and has a notion of inwardness:&nbsp; alpha is the expression
of
<br>size; eta of length; omicron of roundness, and therefore there is plenty
of
<br>omicron in the word goggulon.&nbsp; That is my view, Hermogenes, of
the
<br>correctness of names; and I should like to hear what Cratylus would
say.
<br>'But, Socrates, as I was telling you, Cratylus mystifies me; I should
like
<br>to ask him, in your presence, what he means by the fitness of names?'&nbsp;
To
<br>this appeal, Cratylus replies 'that he cannot explain so important
a
<br>subject all in a moment.'&nbsp; 'No, but you may "add little to little,"
as
<br>Hesiod says.'&nbsp; Socrates here interposes his own request, that
Cratylus will
<br>give some account of his theory.&nbsp; Hermogenes and himself are mere
<br>sciolists, but Cratylus has reflected on these matters, and has had
<br>teachers.&nbsp; Cratylus replies in the words of Achilles:&nbsp; '"Illustrious
Ajax,
<br>you have spoken in all things much to my mind," whether Euthyphro,
or some
<br>Muse inhabiting your own breast, was the inspirer.'&nbsp; Socrates
replies, that
<br>he is afraid of being self-deceived, and therefore he must 'look fore
and
<br>aft,' as Homer remarks.&nbsp; Does not Cratylus agree with him that
names teach
<br>us the nature of things?&nbsp; 'Yes.'&nbsp; And naming is an art, and
the artists are
<br>legislators, and like artists in general, some of them are better and
some
<br>of them are worse than others, and give better or worse laws, and make
<br>better or worse names.&nbsp; Cratylus cannot admit that one name is
better than
<br>another; they are either true names, or they are not names at all;
and when
<br>he is asked about the name of Hermogenes, who is acknowledged to have
no
<br>luck in him, he affirms this to be the name of somebody else.&nbsp;
Socrates
<br>supposes him to mean that falsehood is impossible, to which his own
answer
<br>would be, that there has never been a lack of liars.&nbsp; Cratylus
presses him
<br>with the old sophistical argument, that falsehood is saying that which
is
<br>not, and therefore saying nothing;--you cannot utter the word which
is not.
<br>Socrates complains that this argument is too subtle for an old man
to
<br>understand:&nbsp; Suppose a person addressing Cratylus were to say,
Hail,
<br>Athenian Stranger, Hermogenes! would these words be true or false?&nbsp;
'I
<br>should say that they would be mere unmeaning sounds, like the hammering
of
<br>a brass pot.'&nbsp; But you would acknowledge that names, as well as
pictures,
<br>are imitations, and also that pictures may give a right or wrong
<br>representation of a man or woman:--why may not names then equally give
a
<br>representation true and right or false and wrong?&nbsp; Cratylus admits
that
<br>pictures may give a true or false representation, but denies that names
<br>can.&nbsp; Socrates argues, that he may go up to a man and say 'this
is year
<br>picture,' and again, he may go and say to him 'this is your name'--in
the
<br>one case appealing to his sense of sight, and in the other to his sense
of
<br>hearing;--may he not?&nbsp; 'Yes.'&nbsp; Then you will admit that there
is a right or
<br>a wrong assignment of names, and if of names, then of verbs and nouns;
and
<br>if of verbs and nouns, then of the sentences which are made up of them;
and
<br>comparing nouns to pictures, you may give them all the appropriate
sounds,
<br>or only some of them.&nbsp; And as he who gives all the colours makes
a good
<br>picture, and he who gives only some of them, a bad or imperfect one,
but
<br>still a picture; so he who gives all the sounds makes a good name,
and he
<br>who gives only some of them, a bad or imperfect one, but a name still.&nbsp;
The
<br>artist of names, that is, the legislator, may be a good or he may be
a bad
<br>artist.&nbsp; 'Yes, Socrates, but the cases are not parallel; for if
you
<br>subtract or misplace a letter, the name ceases to be a name.'&nbsp;
Socrates
<br>admits that the number 10, if an unit is subtracted, would cease to
be 10,
<br>but denies that names are of this purely quantitative nature.&nbsp;
Suppose that
<br>there are two objects--Cratylus and the image of Cratylus; and let
us
<br>imagine that some God makes them perfectly alike, both in their outward
<br>form and in their inner nature and qualities:&nbsp; then there will
be two
<br>Cratyluses, and not merely Cratylus and the image of Cratylus.&nbsp;
But an
<br>image in fact always falls short in some degree of the original, and
if
<br>images are not exact counterparts, why should names be? if they were,
they
<br>would be the doubles of their originals, and indistinguishable from
them;
<br>and how ridiculous would this be!&nbsp; Cratylus admits the truth of
Socrates'
<br>remark.&nbsp; But then Socrates rejoins, he should have the courage
to
<br>acknowledge that letters may be wrongly inserted in a noun, or a noun
in a
<br>sentence; and yet the noun or the sentence may retain a meaning.&nbsp;
Better to
<br>admit this, that we may not be punished like the traveller in Egina
who
<br>goes about at night, and that Truth herself may not say to us, 'Too
late.'
<br>And, errors excepted, we may still affirm that a name to be correct
must
<br>have proper letters, which bear a resemblance to the thing signified.&nbsp;
I
<br>must remind you of what Hermogenes and I were saying about the letter
rho
<br>accent, which was held to be expressive of motion and hardness, as
lambda
<br>is of smoothness;--and this you will admit to be their natural meaning.
<br>But then, why do the Eritreans call that skleroter which we call sklerotes?
<br>We can understand one another, although the letter rho accent is not
<br>equivalent to the letter s:&nbsp; why is this?&nbsp; You reply, because
the two
<br>letters are sufficiently alike for the purpose of expressing motion.&nbsp;
Well,
<br>then, there is the letter lambda; what business has this in a word
meaning
<br>hardness?&nbsp; 'Why, Socrates, I retort upon you, that we put in and
pull out
<br>letters at pleasure.'&nbsp; And the explanation of this is custom or
agreement:
<br>we have made a convention that the rho shall mean s and a convention
may
<br>indicate by the unlike as well as by the like.&nbsp; How could there
be names
<br>for all the numbers unless you allow that convention is used?&nbsp;
Imitation is
<br>a poor thing, and has to be supplemented by convention, which is another
<br>poor thing; although I agree with you in thinking that the most perfect
<br>form of language is found only where there is a perfect correspondence
of
<br>sound and meaning.&nbsp; But let me ask you what is the use and force
of names?
<br>'The use of names, Socrates, is to inform, and he who knows names knows
<br>things.'&nbsp; Do you mean that the discovery of names is the same
as the
<br>discovery of things?&nbsp; 'Yes.'&nbsp; But do you not see that there
is a degree of
<br>deception about names?&nbsp; He who first gave names, gave them according
to his
<br>conception, and that may have been erroneous.&nbsp; 'But then, why,
Socrates, is
<br>language so consistent? all words have the same laws.'&nbsp; Mere consistency
is
<br>no test of truth.&nbsp; In geometrical problems, for example, there
may be a
<br>flaw at the beginning, and yet the conclusion may follow consistently.
<br>And, therefore, a wise man will take especial care of first principles.
<br>But are words really consistent; are there not as many terms of praise
<br>which signify rest as which signify motion?&nbsp; There is episteme,
which is
<br>connected with stasis, as mneme is with meno.&nbsp; Bebaion, again,
is the
<br>expression of station and position; istoria is clearly descriptive
of the
<br>stopping istanai of the stream; piston indicates the cessation of motion;
<br>and there are many words having a bad sense, which are connected with
ideas
<br>of motion, such as sumphora, amartia, etc.:&nbsp; amathia, again, might
be
<br>explained, as e ama theo iontos poreia, and akolasia as e akolouthia
tois
<br>pragmasin.&nbsp; Thus the bad names are framed on the same principle
as the
<br>good, and other examples might be given, which would favour a theory
of
<br>rest rather than of motion.&nbsp; 'Yes; but the greater number of words
express
<br>motion.'&nbsp; Are we to count them, Cratylus; and is correctness of
names to be
<br>determined by the voice of a majority?
</p><p>Here is another point:&nbsp; we were saying that the legislator gives
names; and
<br>therefore we must suppose that he knows the things which he names:&nbsp;
but how
<br>can he have learnt things from names before there were any names?&nbsp;
'I
<br>believe, Socrates, that some power more than human first gave things
their
<br>names, and that these were necessarily true names.'&nbsp; Then how
came the
<br>giver of names to contradict himself, and to make some names expressive
of
<br>rest, and others of motion?&nbsp; 'I do not suppose that he did make
them both.'
<br>Then which did he make--those which are expressive of rest, or those
which
<br>are expressive of motion?...But if some names are true and others false,
we
<br>can only decide between them, not by counting words, but by appealing
to
<br>things.&nbsp; And, if so, we must allow that things may be known without
names;
<br>for names, as we have several times admitted, are the images of things;
and
<br>the higher knowledge is of things, and is not to be derived from names;
and
<br>though I do not doubt that the inventors of language gave names, under
the
<br>idea that all things are in a state of motion and flux, I believe that
they
<br>were mistaken; and that having fallen into a whirlpool themselves,
they are
<br>trying to drag us after them.&nbsp; For is there not a true beauty
and a true
<br>good, which is always beautiful and always good?&nbsp; Can the thing
beauty be
<br>vanishing away from us while the words are yet in our mouths?&nbsp;
And they
<br>could not be known by any one if they are always passing away--for
if they
<br>are always passing away, the observer has no opportunity of observing
their
<br>state.&nbsp; Whether the doctrine of the flux or of the eternal nature
be the
<br>truer, is hard to determine.&nbsp; But no man of sense will put himself,
or the
<br>education of his mind, in the power of names:&nbsp; he will not condemn
himself
<br>to be an unreal thing, nor will he believe that everything is in a
flux
<br>like the water in a leaky vessel, or that the world is a man who has
a
<br>running at the nose.&nbsp; This doctrine may be true, Cratylus, but
is also very
<br>likely to be untrue; and therefore I would have you reflect while you
are
<br>young, and find out the truth, and when you know come and tell me.&nbsp;
'I have
<br>thought, Socrates, and after a good deal of thinking I incline to
<br>Heracleitus.'&nbsp; Then another day, my friend, you shall give me
a lesson.
<br>'Very good, Socrates, and I hope that you will continue to study these
<br>things yourself.'
</p><p>...
</p><p>We may now consider (I) how far Plato in the Cratylus has discovered
the
<br>true principles of language, and then (II) proceed to compare modern
<br>speculations respecting the origin and nature of language with the
<br>anticipations of his genius.
</p><p>I.&nbsp; (1) Plato is aware that language is not the work of chance;
nor does he
<br>deny that there is a natural fitness in names.&nbsp; He only insists
that this
<br>natural fitness shall be intelligibly explained.&nbsp; But he has no
idea that
<br>language is a natural organism.&nbsp; He would have heard with surprise
that
<br>languages are the common work of whole nations in a primitive or semi-
<br>barbarous age.&nbsp; How, he would probably have argued, could men
devoid of art
<br>have contrived a structure of such complexity?&nbsp; No answer could
have been
<br>given to this question, either in ancient or in modern times, until
the
<br>nature of primitive antiquity had been thoroughly studied, and the
<br>instincts of man had been shown to exist in greater force, when his
state
<br>approaches more nearly to that of children or animals.&nbsp; The philosophers
of
<br>the last century, after their manner, would have vainly endeavoured
to
<br>trace the process by which proper names were converted into common,
and
<br>would have shown how the last effort of abstraction invented prepositions
<br>and auxiliaries.&nbsp; The theologian would have proved that language
must have
<br>had a divine origin, because in childhood, while the organs are pliable,
<br>the intelligence is wanting, and when the intelligence is able to frame
<br>conceptions, the organs are no longer able to express them.&nbsp; Or,
as others
<br>have said:&nbsp; Man is man because he has the gift of speech; and
he could not
<br>have invented that which he is.&nbsp; But this would have been an 'argument
too
<br>subtle' for Socrates, who rejects the theological account of the origin
of
<br>language 'as an excuse for not giving a reason,' which he compares
to the
<br>introduction of the 'Deus ex machina' by the tragic poets when they
have to
<br>solve a difficulty; thus anticipating many modern controversies in
which
<br>the primary agency of the divine Being is confused with the secondary
<br>cause; and God is assumed to have worked a miracle in order to fill
up a
<br>lacuna in human knowledge.&nbsp; (Compare Timaeus.)
</p><p>Neither is Plato wrong in supposing that an element of design and art
<br>enters into language.&nbsp; The creative power abating is supplemented
by a
<br>mechanical process.&nbsp; 'Languages are not made but grow,' but they
are made
<br>as well as grow; bursting into life like a plant or a flower, they
are also
<br>capable of being trained and improved and engrafted upon one another.&nbsp;
The
<br>change in them is effected in earlier ages by musical and euphonic
<br>improvements, at a later stage by the influence of grammar and logic,
and
<br>by the poetical and literary use of words.&nbsp; They develope rapidly
in
<br>childhood, and when they are full grown and set they may still put
forth
<br>intellectual powers, like the mind in the body, or rather we may say
that
<br>the nobler use of language only begins when the frame-work is complete.
<br>The savage or primitive man, in whom the natural instinct is strongest,
is
<br>also the greatest improver of the forms of language.&nbsp; He is the
poet or
<br>maker of words, as in civilised ages the dialectician is the definer
or
<br>distinguisher of them.&nbsp; The latter calls the second world of abstract
terms
<br>into existence, as the former has created the picture sounds which
<br>represent natural objects or processes.&nbsp; Poetry and philosophy--these
two,
<br>are the two great formative principles of language, when they have
passed
<br>their first stage, of which, as of the first invention of the arts
in
<br>general, we only entertain conjecture.&nbsp; And mythology is a link
between
<br>them, connecting the visible and invisible, until at length the sensuous
<br>exterior falls away, and the severance of the inner and outer world,
of the
<br>idea and the object of sense, becomes complete.&nbsp; At a later period,
logic
<br>and grammar, sister arts, preserve and enlarge the decaying instinct
of
<br>language, by rule and method, which they gather from analysis and
<br>observation.
</p><p>(2) There is no trace in any of Plato's writings that he was acquainted
<br>with any language but Greek.&nbsp; Yet he has conceived very truly
the relation
<br>of Greek to foreign languages, which he is led to consider, because
he
<br>finds that many Greek words are incapable of explanation.&nbsp; Allowing
a good
<br>deal for accident, and also for the fancies of the conditores linguae
<br>Graecae, there is an element of which he is unable to give an account.
<br>These unintelligible words he supposes to be of foreign origin, and
to have
<br>been derived from a time when the Greeks were either barbarians, or
in
<br>close relations to the barbarians.&nbsp; Socrates is aware that this
principle
<br>is liable to great abuse; and, like the 'Deus ex machina,' explains
<br>nothing.&nbsp; Hence he excuses himself for the employment of such
a device,
<br>and remarks that in foreign words there is still a principle of
<br>correctness, which applies equally both to Greeks and barbarians.
</p><p>(3)&nbsp; But the greater number of primary words do not admit of derivation
<br>from foreign languages; they must be resolved into the letters out
of which
<br>they are composed, and therefore the letters must have a meaning.&nbsp;
The
<br>framers of language were aware of this; they observed that alpha was
<br>adapted to express size; eta length; omicron roundness; nu inwardness;
rho
<br>accent rush or roar; lambda liquidity; gamma lambda the detention of
the
<br>liquid or slippery element; delta and tau binding; phi, psi, sigma,
xi,
<br>wind and cold, and so on.&nbsp; Plato's analysis of the letters of
the alphabet
<br>shows a wonderful insight into the nature of language.&nbsp; He does
not
<br>expressively distinguish between mere imitation and the symbolical
use of
<br>sound to express thought, but he recognises in the examples which he
gives
<br>both modes of imitation.&nbsp; Gesture is the mode which a deaf and
dumb person
<br>would take of indicating his meaning.&nbsp; And language is the gesture
of the
<br>tongue; in the use of the letter rho accent, to express a rushing or
<br>roaring, or of omicron to express roundness, there is a direct imitation;
<br>while in the use of the letter alpha to express size, or of eta to
express
<br>length, the imitation is symbolical.&nbsp; The use of analogous or
similar
<br>sounds, in order to express similar analogous ideas, seems to have
escaped
<br>him.
</p><p>In passing from the gesture of the body to the movement of the tongue,
<br>Plato makes a great step in the physiology of language.&nbsp; He was
probably
<br>the first who said that 'language is imitative sound,' which is the
<br>greatest and deepest truth of philology; although he is not aware of
the
<br>laws of euphony and association by which imitation must be regulated.&nbsp;
He
<br>was probably also the first who made a distinction between simple and
<br>compound words, a truth second only in importance to that which has
just
<br>been mentioned.&nbsp; His great insight in one direction curiously
contrasts
<br>with his blindness in another; for he appears to be wholly unaware
(compare
<br>his derivation of agathos from agastos and thoos) of the difference
between
<br>the root and termination.&nbsp; But we must recollect that he was necessarily
<br>more ignorant than any schoolboy of Greek grammar, and had no table
of the
<br>inflexions of verbs and nouns before his eyes, which might have suggested
<br>to him the distinction.
</p><p>(4) Plato distinctly affirms that language is not truth, or 'philosophie
<br>une langue bien faite.'&nbsp; At first, Socrates has delighted himself
with
<br>discovering the flux of Heracleitus in language.&nbsp; But he is covertly
<br>satirising the pretence of that or any other age to find philosophy
in
<br>words; and he afterwards corrects any erroneous inference which might
be
<br>gathered from his experiment.&nbsp; For he finds as many, or almost
as many,
<br>words expressive of rest, as he had previously found expressive of
motion.
<br>And even if this had been otherwise, who would learn of words when
he might
<br>learn of things?&nbsp; There is a great controversy and high argument
between
<br>Heracleiteans and Eleatics, but no man of sense would commit his soul
in
<br>such enquiries to the imposers of names...In this and other passages
Plato
<br>shows that he is as completely emancipated from the influence of 'Idols
of
<br>the tribe' as Bacon himself.
</p><p>The lesson which may be gathered from words is not metaphysical or moral,
<br>but historical.&nbsp; They teach us the affinity of races, they tell
us
<br>something about the association of ideas, they occasionally preserve
the
<br>memory of a disused custom; but we cannot safely argue from them about
<br>right and wrong, matter and mind, freedom and necessity, or the other
<br>problems of moral and metaphysical philosophy.&nbsp; For the use of
words on
<br>such subjects may often be metaphorical, accidental, derived from other
<br>languages, and may have no relation to the contemporary state of thought
<br>and feeling.&nbsp; Nor in any case is the invention of them the result
of
<br>philosophical reflection; they have been commonly transferred from
matter
<br>to mind, and their meaning is the very reverse of their etymology.&nbsp;
Because
<br>there is or is not a name for a thing, we cannot argue that the thing
has
<br>or has not an actual existence; or that the antitheses, parallels,
<br>conjugates, correlatives of language have anything corresponding to
them in
<br>nature.&nbsp; There are too many words as well as too few; and they
generalize
<br>the objects or ideas which they represent.&nbsp; The greatest lesson
which the
<br>philosophical analysis of language teaches us is, that we should be
above
<br>language, making words our servants, and not allowing them to be our
<br>masters.
</p><p>Plato does not add the further observation, that the etymological meaning
<br>of words is in process of being lost.&nbsp; If at first framed on a
principle of
<br>intelligibility, they would gradually cease to be intelligible, like
those
<br>of a foreign language, he is willing to admit that they are subject
to many
<br>changes, and put on many disguises.&nbsp; He acknowledges that the
'poor
<br>creature' imitation is supplemented by another 'poor creature,'--
<br>convention.&nbsp; But he does not see that 'habit and repute,' and
their
<br>relation to other words, are always exercising an influence over them.
<br>Words appear to be isolated, but they are really the parts of an organism
<br>which is always being reproduced.&nbsp; They are refined by civilization,
<br>harmonized by poetry, emphasized by literature, technically applied
in
<br>philosophy and art; they are used as symbols on the border-ground of
human
<br>knowledge; they receive a fresh impress from individual genius, and
come
<br>with a new force and association to every lively-minded person.&nbsp;
They are
<br>fixed by the simultaneous utterance of millions, and yet are always
<br>imperceptibly changing;--not the inventors of language, but writing
and
<br>speaking, and particularly great writers, or works which pass into
the
<br>hearts of nations, Homer, Shakespear, Dante, the German or English
Bible,
<br>Kant and Hegel, are the makers of them in later ages.&nbsp; They carry
with them
<br>the faded recollection of their own past history; the use of a word
in a
<br>striking and familiar passage gives a complexion to its use everywhere
<br>else, and the new use of an old and familiar phrase has also a peculiar
<br>power over us.&nbsp; But these and other subtleties of language escaped
the
<br>observation of Plato.&nbsp; He is not aware that the languages of the
world are
<br>organic structures, and that every word in them is related to every
other;
<br>nor does he conceive of language as the joint work of the speaker and
the
<br>hearer, requiring in man a faculty not only of expressing his thoughts
but
<br>of understanding those of others.
</p><p>On the other hand, he cannot be justly charged with a desire to frame
<br>language on artificial principles.&nbsp; Philosophers have sometimes
dreamed of
<br>a technical or scientific language, in words which should have fixed
<br>meanings, and stand in the same relation to one another as the substances
<br>which they denote.&nbsp; But there is no more trace of this in Plato
than there
<br>is of a language corresponding to the ideas; nor, indeed, could the
want of
<br>such a language be felt until the sciences were far more developed.&nbsp;
Those
<br>who would extend the use of technical phraseology beyond the limits
of
<br>science or of custom, seem to forget that freedom and suggestiveness
and
<br>the play of association are essential characteristics of language.&nbsp;
The
<br>great master has shown how he regarded pedantic distinctions of words
or
<br>attempts to confine their meaning in the satire on Prodicus in the
<br>Protagoras.
</p><p>(5) In addition to these anticipations of the general principles of
<br>philology, we may note also a few curious observations on words and
sounds.
<br>'The Eretrians say sklerotes for skleroter;' 'the Thessalians call
Apollo
<br>Amlos;' 'The Phrygians have the words pur, udor, kunes slightly changed;'
<br>'there is an old Homeric word emesato, meaning "he contrived";' 'our
<br>forefathers, and especially the women, who are most conservative of
the
<br>ancient language, loved the letters iota and delta; but now iota is
changed
<br>into eta and epsilon, and delta into zeta; this is supposed to increase
the
<br>grandeur of the sound.'&nbsp; Plato was very willing to use inductive
arguments,
<br>so far as they were within his reach; but he would also have assigned
a
<br>large influence to chance.&nbsp; Nor indeed is induction applicable
to philology
<br>in the same degree as to most of the physical sciences.&nbsp; For after
we have
<br>pushed our researches to the furthest point, in language as in all
the
<br>other creations of the human mind, there will always remain an element
of
<br>exception or accident or free-will, which cannot be eliminated.
</p><p>The question, 'whether falsehood is impossible,' which Socrates
<br>characteristically sets aside as too subtle for an old man (compare
<br>Euthyd.), could only have arisen in an age of imperfect consciousness,
<br>which had not yet learned to distinguish words from things.&nbsp; Socrates
<br>replies in effect that words have an independent existence; thus
<br>anticipating the solution of the mediaeval controversy of Nominalism
and
<br>Realism.&nbsp; He is aware too that languages exist in various degrees
of
<br>perfection, and that the analysis of them can only be carried to a
certain
<br>point.&nbsp; 'If we could always, or almost always, use likenesses,
which are
<br>the appropriate expressions, that would be the most perfect state of
<br>language.'&nbsp; These words suggest a question of deeper interest
than the
<br>origin of language; viz. what is the ideal of language, how far by
any
<br>correction of their usages existing languages might become clearer
and more
<br>expressive than they are, more poetical, and also more logical; or
whether
<br>they are now finally fixed and have received their last impress from
time
<br>and authority.
</p><p>On the whole, the Cratylus seems to contain deeper truths about language
<br>than any other ancient writing.&nbsp; But feeling the uncertain ground
upon
<br>which he is walking, and partly in order to preserve the character
of
<br>Socrates, Plato envelopes the whole subject in a robe of fancy, and
allows
<br>his principles to drop out as if by accident.
</p><p>II.&nbsp; What is the result of recent speculations about the origin
and nature
<br>of language?&nbsp; Like other modern metaphysical enquiries, they end
at last in
<br>a statement of facts.&nbsp; But, in order to state or understand the
facts, a
<br>metaphysical insight seems to be required.&nbsp; There are more things
in
<br>language than the human mind easily conceives.&nbsp; And many fallacies
have to
<br>be dispelled, as well as observations made.&nbsp; The true spirit of
philosophy
<br>or metaphysics can alone charm away metaphysical illusions, which are
<br>always reappearing, formerly in the fancies of neoplatonist writers,
now in
<br>the disguise of experience and common sense.&nbsp; An analogy, a figure
of
<br>speech, an intelligible theory, a superficial observation of the
<br>individual, have often been mistaken for a true account of the origin
of
<br>language.
</p><p>Speaking is one of the simplest natural operations, and also the most
<br>complex.&nbsp; Nothing would seem to be easier or more trivial than
a few words
<br>uttered by a child in any language.&nbsp; Yet into the formation of
those words
<br>have entered causes which the human mind is not capable of calculating.
<br>They are a drop or two of the great stream or ocean of speech which
has
<br>been flowing in all ages.&nbsp; They have been transmitted from one
language to
<br>another; like the child himself, they go back to the beginnings of
the
<br>human race.&nbsp; How they originated, who can tell?&nbsp; Nevertheless
we can
<br>imagine a stage of human society in which the circle of men's minds
was
<br>narrower and their sympathies and instincts stronger; in which their
organs
<br>of speech were more flexible, and the sense of hearing finer and more
<br>discerning; in which they lived more in company, and after the manner
of
<br>children were more given to express their feelings; in which 'they
moved
<br>all together,' like a herd of wild animals, 'when they moved at all.'
<br>Among them, as in every society, a particular person would be more
<br>sensitive and intelligent than the rest.&nbsp; Suddenly, on some occasion
of
<br>interest (at the approach of a wild beast, shall we say?), he first,
they
<br>following him, utter a cry which resounds through the forest.&nbsp;
The cry is
<br>almost or quite involuntary, and may be an imitation of the roar of
the
<br>animal.&nbsp; Thus far we have not speech, but only the inarticulate
expression
<br>of feeling or emotion in no respect differing from the cries of animals;
<br>for they too call to one another and are answered.&nbsp; But now suppose
that
<br>some one at a distance not only hears the sound, but apprehends the
<br>meaning:&nbsp; or we may imagine that the cry is repeated to a member
of the
<br>society who had been absent; the others act the scene over again when
he
<br>returns home in the evening.&nbsp; And so the cry becomes a word.&nbsp;
The hearer in
<br>turn gives back the word to the speaker, who is now aware that he has
<br>acquired a new power.&nbsp; Many thousand times he exercises this power;
like a
<br>child learning to talk, he repeats the same cry again, and again he
is
<br>answered; he tries experiments with a like result, and the speaker
and the
<br>hearer rejoice together in their newly-discovered faculty.&nbsp; At
first there
<br>would be few such cries, and little danger of mistaking or confusing
them.
<br>For the mind of primitive man had a narrow range of perceptions and
<br>feelings; his senses were microscopic; twenty or thirty sounds or gestures
<br>would be enough for him, nor would he have any difficulty in finding
them.
<br>Naturally he broke out into speech--like the young infant he laughed
and
<br>babbled; but not until there were hearers as well as speakers did language
<br>begin.&nbsp; Not the interjection or the vocal imitation of the object,
but the
<br>interjection or the vocal imitation of the object understood, is the
first
<br>rudiment of human speech.
</p><p>After a while the word gathers associations, and has an independent
<br>existence.&nbsp; The imitation of the lion's roar calls up the fears
and hopes
<br>of the chase, which are excited by his appearance.&nbsp; In the moment
of
<br>hearing the sound, without any appreciable interval, these and other
latent
<br>experiences wake up in the mind of the hearer.&nbsp; Not only does
he receive an
<br>impression, but he brings previous knowledge to bear upon that impression.
<br>Necessarily the pictorial image becomes less vivid, while the association
<br>of the nature and habits of the animal is more distinctly perceived.&nbsp;
The
<br>picture passes into a symbol, for there would be too many of them and
they
<br>would crowd the mind; the vocal imitation, too, is always in process
of
<br>being lost and being renewed, just as the picture is brought back again
in
<br>the description of the poet.&nbsp; Words now can be used more freely
because
<br>there are more of them.&nbsp; What was once an involuntary expression
becomes
<br>voluntary.&nbsp; Not only can men utter a cry or call, but they can
communicate
<br>and converse; they can not only use words, but they can even play with
<br>them.&nbsp; The word is separated both from the object and from the
mind; and
<br>slowly nations and individuals attain to a fuller consciousness of
<br>themselves.
</p><p>Parallel with this mental process the articulation of sounds is gradually
<br>becoming perfected.&nbsp; The finer sense detects the differences of
them, and
<br>begins, first to agglomerate, then to distinguish them.&nbsp; Times,
persons,
<br>places, relations of all kinds, are expressed by modifications of them.
<br>The earliest parts of speech, as we may call them by anticipation,
like the
<br>first utterances of children, probably partook of the nature of
<br>interjections and nouns; then came verbs; at length the whole sentence
<br>appeared, and rhythm and metre followed.&nbsp; Each stage in the progress
of
<br>language was accompanied by some corresponding stage in the mind and
<br>civilisation of man.&nbsp; In time, when the family became a nation,
the wild
<br>growth of dialects passed into a language.&nbsp; Then arose poetry
and
<br>literature.&nbsp; We can hardly realize to ourselves how much with
each
<br>improvement of language the powers of the human mind were enlarged;
how the
<br>inner world took the place of outer; how the pictorial or symbolical
or
<br>analogical word was refined into a notion; how language, fair and large
and
<br>free, was at last complete.
</p><p>So we may imagine the speech of man to have begun as with the cries
of
<br>animals, or the stammering lips of children, and to have attained by
<br>degrees the perfection of Homer and Plato.&nbsp; Yet we are far from
saying that
<br>this or any other theory of language is proved by facts.&nbsp; It is
not
<br>difficult to form an hypothesis which by a series of imaginary transitions
<br>will bridge over the chasm which separates man from the animals.
<br>Differences of kind may often be thus resolved into differences of
degree.
<br>But we must not assume that we have in this way discovered the true
account
<br>of them.&nbsp; Through what struggles the harmonious use of the organs
of speech
<br>was acquired; to what extent the conditions of human life were different;
<br>how far the genius of individuals may have contributed to the discovery
of
<br>this as of the other arts, we cannot say:&nbsp; Only we seem to see
that
<br>language is as much the creation of the ear as of the tongue, and the
<br>expression of a movement stirring the hearts not of one man only but
of
<br>many, 'as the trees of the wood are stirred by the wind.'&nbsp; The
theory is
<br>consistent or not inconsistent with our own mental experience, and
throws
<br>some degree of light upon a dark corner of the human mind.
</p><p>In the later analysis of language, we trace the opposite and contrasted
<br>elements of the individual and nation, of the past and present, of
the
<br>inward and outward, of the subject and object, of the notional and
<br>relational, of the root or unchanging part of the word and of the changing
<br>inflexion, if such a distinction be admitted, of the vowel and the
<br>consonant, of quantity and accent, of speech and writing, of poetry
and
<br>prose.&nbsp; We observe also the reciprocal influence of sounds and
conceptions
<br>on each other, like the connexion of body and mind; and further remark
that
<br>although the names of objects were originally proper names, as the
<br>grammarian or logician might call them, yet at a later stage they become
<br>universal notions, which combine into particulars and individuals,
and are
<br>taken out of the first rude agglomeration of sounds that they may be
<br>replaced in a higher and more logical order.&nbsp; We see that in the
simplest
<br>sentences are contained grammar and logic--the parts of speech, the
Eleatic
<br>philosophy and the Kantian categories.&nbsp; So complex is language,
and so
<br>expressive not only of the meanest wants of man, but of his highest
<br>thoughts; so various are the aspects in which it is regarded by us.&nbsp;
Then
<br>again, when we follow the history of languages, we observe that they
are
<br>always slowly moving, half dead, half alive, half solid, half fluid;
the
<br>breath of a moment, yet like the air, continuous in all ages and
<br>countries,--like the glacier, too, containing within them a trickling
<br>stream which deposits debris of the rocks over which it passes.&nbsp;
There were
<br>happy moments, as we may conjecture, in the lives of nations, at which
they
<br>came to the birth--as in the golden age of literature, the man and
the time
<br>seem to conspire; the eloquence of the bard or chief, as in later times
the
<br>creations of the great writer who is the expression of his age, became
<br>impressed on the minds of their countrymen, perhaps in the hour of
some
<br>crisis of national development--a migration, a conquest, or the like.&nbsp;
The
<br>picture of the word which was beginning to be lost, is now revived;
the
<br>sound again echoes to the sense; men find themselves capable not only
of
<br>expressing more feelings, and describing more objects, but of expressing
<br>and describing them better.&nbsp; The world before the flood, that
is to say,
<br>the world of ten, twenty, a hundred thousand years ago, has passed
away and
<br>left no sign.&nbsp; But the best conception that we can form of it,
though
<br>imperfect and uncertain, is gained from the analogy of causes still
in
<br>action, some powerful and sudden, others working slowly in the course
of
<br>infinite ages.&nbsp; Something too may be allowed to 'the persistency
of the
<br>strongest,' to 'the survival of the fittest,' in this as in the other
<br>realms of nature.
</p><p>These are some of the reflections which the modern philosophy of language
<br>suggests to us about the powers of the human mind and the forces and
<br>influences by which the efforts of men to utter articulate sounds were
<br>inspired.&nbsp; Yet in making these and similar generalizations we
may note also
<br>dangers to which we are exposed.&nbsp; (1) There is the confusion of
ideas with
<br>facts--of mere possibilities, and generalities, and modes of conception
<br>with actual and definite knowledge.&nbsp; The words 'evolution,' 'birth,'
'law,'
<br>development,' 'instinct,' 'implicit,' 'explicit,' and the like, have
a
<br>false clearness or comprehensiveness, which adds nothing to our knowledge.
<br>The metaphor of a flower or a tree, or some other work of nature or
art, is
<br>often in like manner only a pleasing picture.&nbsp; (2) There is the
fallacy of
<br>resolving the languages which we know into their parts, and then imagining
<br>that we can discover the nature of language by reconstructing them.&nbsp;
(3)
<br>There is the danger of identifying language, not with thoughts but
with
<br>ideas.&nbsp; (4) There is the error of supposing that the analysis
of grammar
<br>and logic has always existed, or that their distinctions were familiar
to
<br>Socrates and Plato.&nbsp; (5) There is the fallacy of exaggerating,
and also of
<br>diminishing the interval which separates articulate from inarticulate
<br>language--the cries of animals from the speech of man--the instincts
of
<br>animals from the reason of man.&nbsp; (6) There is the danger which
besets all
<br>enquiries into the early history of man--of interpreting the past by
the
<br>present, and of substituting the definite and intelligible for the
true but
<br>dim outline which is the horizon of human knowledge.
</p><p>The greatest light is thrown upon the nature of language by analogy.&nbsp;
We
<br>have the analogy of the cries of animals, of the songs of birds ('man,
like
<br>the nightingale, is a singing bird, but is ever binding up thoughts
with
<br>musical notes'), of music, of children learning to speak, of barbarous
<br>nations in which the linguistic instinct is still undecayed, of ourselves
<br>learning to think and speak a new language, of the deaf and dumb who
have
<br>words without sounds, of the various disorders of speech; and we have
the
<br>after-growth of mythology, which, like language, is an unconscious
creation
<br>of the human mind.&nbsp; We can observe the social and collective instincts
of
<br>animals, and may remark how, when domesticated, they have the power
of
<br>understanding but not of speaking, while on the other hand, some birds
<br>which are comparatively devoid of intelligence, make a nearer approach
to
<br>articulate speech.&nbsp; We may note how in the animals there is a
want of that
<br>sympathy with one another which appears to be the soul of language.&nbsp;
We can
<br>compare the use of speech with other mental and bodily operations;
for
<br>speech too is a kind of gesture, and in the child or savage accompanied
<br>with gesture.&nbsp; We may observe that the child learns to speak,
as he learns
<br>to walk or to eat, by a natural impulse; yet in either case not without
a
<br>power of imitation which is also natural to him--he is taught to read,
but
<br>he breaks forth spontaneously in speech.&nbsp; We can trace the impulse
to bind
<br>together the world in ideas beginning in the first efforts to speak
and
<br>culminating in philosophy.&nbsp; But there remains an element which
cannot be
<br>explained, or even adequately described.&nbsp; We can understand how
man creates
<br>or constructs consciously and by design; and see, if we do not understand,
<br>how nature, by a law, calls into being an organised structure.&nbsp;
But the
<br>intermediate organism which stands between man and nature, which is
the
<br>work of mind yet unconscious, and in which mind and matter seem to
meet,
<br>and mind unperceived to herself is really limited by all other minds,
is
<br>neither understood nor seen by us, and is with reluctance admitted
to be a
<br>fact.
</p><p>Language is an aspect of man, of nature, and of nations, the
<br>transfiguration of the world in thought, the meeting-point of the physical
<br>and mental sciences, and also the mirror in which they are reflected,
<br>present at every moment to the individual, and yet having a sort of
eternal
<br>or universal nature.&nbsp; When we analyze our own mental processes,
we find
<br>words everywhere in every degree of clearness and consistency, fading
away
<br>in dreams and more like pictures, rapidly succeeding one another in
our
<br>waking thoughts, attaining a greater distinctness and consecutiveness
in
<br>speech, and a greater still in writing, taking the place of one another
<br>when we try to become emancipated from their influence.&nbsp; For in
all
<br>processes of the mind which are conscious we are talking to ourselves;
the
<br>attempt to think without words is a mere illusion,--they are always
<br>reappearing when we fix our thoughts.&nbsp; And speech is not a separate
<br>faculty, but the expression of all our faculties, to which all our
other
<br>powers of expression, signs, looks, gestures, lend their aid, of which
the
<br>instrument is not the tongue only, but more than half the human frame.
</p><p>The minds of men are sometimes carried on to think of their lives and
of
<br>their actions as links in a chain of causes and effects going back
to the
<br>beginning of time.&nbsp; A few have seemed to lose the sense of their
own
<br>individuality in the universal cause or nature.&nbsp; In like manner
we might
<br>think of the words which we daily use, as derived from the first speech
of
<br>man, and of all the languages in the world, as the expressions or varieties
<br>of a single force or life of language of which the thoughts of men
are the
<br>accident.&nbsp; Such a conception enables us to grasp the power and
wonder of
<br>languages, and is very natural to the scientific philologist.&nbsp;
For he, like
<br>the metaphysician, believes in the reality of that which absorbs his
own
<br>mind.&nbsp; Nor do we deny the enormous influence which language has
exercised
<br>over thought.&nbsp; Fixed words, like fixed ideas, have often governed
the
<br>world.&nbsp; But in such representations we attribute to language too
much the
<br>nature of a cause, and too little of an effect,--too much of an absolute,
<br>too little of a relative character,--too much of an ideal, too little
of a
<br>matter-of-fact existence.
</p><p>Or again, we may frame a single abstract notion of language of which
all
<br>existent languages may be supposed to be the perversion.&nbsp; But
we must not
<br>conceive that this logical figment had ever a real existence, or is
<br>anything more than an effort of the mind to give unity to infinitely
<br>various phenomena.&nbsp; There is no abstract language 'in rerum natura,'
any
<br>more than there is an abstract tree, but only languages in various
stages
<br>of growth, maturity, and decay.&nbsp; Nor do other logical distinctions
or even
<br>grammatical exactly correspond to the facts of language; for they too
are
<br>attempts to give unity and regularity to a subject which is partly
<br>irregular.
</p><p>We find, however, that there are distinctions of another kind by which
this
<br>vast field of language admits of being mapped out.&nbsp; There is the
<br>distinction between biliteral and triliteral roots, and the various
<br>inflexions which accompany them; between the mere mechanical cohesion
of
<br>sounds or words, and the 'chemical' combination of them into a new
word;
<br>there is the distinction between languages which have had a free and
full
<br>development of their organisms, and languages which have been stunted
in
<br>their growth,--lamed in their hands or feet, and never able to acquire
<br>afterwards the powers in which they are deficient; there is the distinction
<br>between synthetical languages like Greek and Latin, which have retained
<br>their inflexions, and analytical languages like English or French,
which
<br>have lost them.&nbsp; Innumerable as are the languages and dialects
of mankind,
<br>there are comparatively few classes to which they can be referred.
</p><p>Another road through this chaos is provided by the physiology of speech.
<br>The organs of language are the same in all mankind, and are only capable
of
<br>uttering a certain number of sounds.&nbsp; Every man has tongue, teeth,
lips,
<br>palate, throat, mouth, which he may close or open, and adapt in various
<br>ways; making, first, vowels and consonants; and secondly, other classes
of
<br>letters.&nbsp; The elements of all speech, like the elements of the
musical
<br>scale, are few and simple, though admitting of infinite gradations
and
<br>combinations.&nbsp; Whatever slight differences exist in the use or
formation of
<br>these organs, owing to climate or the sense of euphony or other causes,
<br>they are as nothing compared with their agreement.&nbsp; Here then
is a real
<br>basis of unity in the study of philology, unlike that imaginary abstract
<br>unity of which we were just now speaking.
</p><p>Whether we regard language from the psychological, or historical, or
<br>physiological point of view, the materials of our knowledge are
<br>inexhaustible.&nbsp; The comparisons of children learning to speak,
of barbarous
<br>nations, of musical notes, of the cries of animals, of the song of
birds,
<br>increase our insight into the nature of human speech.&nbsp; Many observations
<br>which would otherwise have escaped us are suggested by them.&nbsp;
But they do
<br>not explain why, in man and in man only, the speaker met with a response
<br>from the hearer, and the half articulate sound gradually developed
into
<br>Sanscrit and Greek.&nbsp; They hardly enable us to approach any nearer
the
<br>secret of the origin of language, which, like some of the other great
<br>secrets of nature,--the origin of birth and death, or of animal life,--
<br>remains inviolable.&nbsp; That problem is indissolubly bound up with
the origin
<br>of man; and if we ever know more of the one, we may expect to know
more of
<br>the other.&nbsp; (Compare W. Humboldt, 'Ueber die Verschiedenheit des
<br>menschlichen Sprachbaues;' M. Muller, 'Lectures on the Science of
<br>Language;' Steinthal, 'Einleitung in die Psychologie und
<br>Sprachwissenschaft.'
</p><p>...
</p><p>It is more than sixteen years since the preceding remarks were written,
<br>which with a few alterations have now been reprinted.&nbsp; During
the interval
<br>the progress of philology has been very great.&nbsp; More languages
have been
<br>compared; the inner structure of language has been laid bare; the relations
<br>of sounds have been more accurately discriminated; the manner in which
<br>dialects affect or are affected by the literary or principal form of
a
<br>language is better understood.&nbsp; Many merely verbal questions have
been
<br>eliminated; the remains of the old traditional methods have died away.&nbsp;
The
<br>study has passed from the metaphysical into an historical stage.&nbsp;
Grammar
<br>is no longer confused with language, nor the anatomy of words and sentences
<br>with their life and use.&nbsp; Figures of speech, by which the vagueness
of
<br>theories is often concealed, have been stripped off; and we see language
<br>more as it truly was.&nbsp; The immensity of the subject is gradually
revealed
<br>to us, and the reign of law becomes apparent.&nbsp; Yet the law is
but partially
<br>seen; the traces of it are often lost in the distance.&nbsp; For languages
have
<br>a natural but not a perfect growth; like other creations of nature
into
<br>which the will of man enters, they are full of what we term accident
and
<br>irregularity.&nbsp; And the difficulties of the subject become not
less, but
<br>greater, as we proceed--it is one of those studies in which we seem
to know
<br>less as we know more; partly because we are no longer satisfied with
the
<br>vague and superficial ideas of it which prevailed fifty years ago;
partly
<br>also because the remains of the languages with which we are acquainted
<br>always were, and if they are still living, are, in a state of transition;
<br>and thirdly, because there are lacunae in our knowledge of them which
can
<br>never be filled up.&nbsp; Not a tenth, not a hundredth part of them
has been
<br>preserved.&nbsp; Yet the materials at our disposal are far greater
than any
<br>individual can use.&nbsp; Such are a few of the general reflections
which the
<br>present state of philology calls up.
</p><p>(1)&nbsp; Language seems to be composite, but into its first elements
the
<br>philologer has never been able to penetrate.&nbsp; However far he goes
back, he
<br>never arrives at the beginning; or rather, as in Geology or in Astronomy,
<br>there is no beginning.&nbsp; He is too apt to suppose that by breaking
up the
<br>existing forms of language into their parts he will arrive at a previous
<br>stage of it, but he is merely analyzing what never existed, or is never
<br>known to have existed, except in a composite form.&nbsp; He may divide
nouns and
<br>verbs into roots and inflexions, but he has no evidence which will
show
<br>that the omega of tupto or the mu of tithemi, though analogous to ego,
me,
<br>either became pronouns or were generated out of pronouns.&nbsp; To
say that
<br>'pronouns, like ripe fruit, dropped out of verbs,' is a misleading
figure
<br>of speech.&nbsp; Although all languages have some common principles,
there is no
<br>primitive form or forms of language known to us, or to be reasonably
<br>imagined, from which they are all descended.&nbsp; No inference can
be drawn
<br>from language, either for or against the unity of the human race.&nbsp;
Nor is
<br>there any proof that words were ever used without any relation to each
<br>other.&nbsp; Whatever may be the meaning of a sentence or a word when
applied to
<br>primitive language, it is probable that the sentence is more akin to
the
<br>original form than the word, and that the later stage of language is
the
<br>result rather of analysis than of synthesis, or possibly is a combination
<br>of the two.&nbsp; Nor, again, are we sure that the original process
of learning
<br>to speak was the same in different places or among different races
of men.
<br>It may have been slower with some, quicker with others.&nbsp; Some
tribes may
<br>have used shorter, others longer words or cries:&nbsp; they may have
been more
<br>or less inclined to agglutinate or to decompose them:&nbsp; they may
have
<br>modified them by the use of prefixes, suffixes, infixes; by the lengthening
<br>and strengthening of vowels or by the shortening and weakening of them,
by
<br>the condensation or rarefaction of consonants.&nbsp; But who gave to
language
<br>these primeval laws; or why one race has triliteral, another biliteral
<br>roots; or why in some members of a group of languages b becomes p,
or d, t,
<br>or ch, k; or why two languages resemble one another in certain parts
of
<br>their structure and differ in others; or why in one language there
is a
<br>greater development of vowels, in another of consonants, and the like--are
<br>questions of which we only 'entertain conjecture.'&nbsp; We must remember
the
<br>length of time that has elapsed since man first walked upon the earth,
and
<br>that in this vast but unknown period every variety of language may
have
<br>been in process of formation and decay, many times over.
</p><p>(Compare Plato, Laws):--
</p><p>'ATHENIAN STRANGER:&nbsp; And what then is to be regarded as the origin
of
<br>government?&nbsp; Will not a man be able to judge best from a point
of view in
<br>which he may behold the progress of states and their transitions to
good
<br>and evil?
</p><p>CLEINIAS:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>ATHENIAN STRANGER:&nbsp; I mean that he might watch them from the point
of view
<br>of time, and observe the changes which take place in them during infinite
<br>ages.
</p><p>CLEINIAS:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>ATHENIAN STRANGER:&nbsp; Why, do you think that you can reckon the time
which
<br>has elapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them?
</p><p>CLEINIAS:&nbsp; Hardly.
</p><p>ATHENIAN STRANGER:&nbsp; But you are quite sure that it must be vast
and
<br>incalculable?
</p><p>CLEINIAS:&nbsp; No doubt.
</p><p>ATHENIAN STRANGER:&nbsp; And have there not been thousands and thousands
of
<br>cities which have come into being and perished during this period?&nbsp;
And has
<br>not every place had endless forms of government, and been sometimes
rising,
<br>and at other times falling, and again improving or waning?'
</p><p>Aristot. Metaph.:--
</p><p>'And if a person should conceive the tales of mythology to mean only
that
<br>men thought the gods to be the first essences of things, he would deem
the
<br>reflection to have been inspired and would consider that, whereas probably
<br>every art and part of wisdom had been DISCOVERED AND LOST MANY TIMES
OVER,
<br>such notions were but a remnant of the past which has survived to our
<br>day.')
</p><p>It can hardly be supposed that any traces of an original language still
<br>survive, any more than of the first huts or buildings which were
<br>constructed by man.&nbsp; Nor are we at all certain of the relation,
if any, in
<br>which the greater families of languages stand to each other.&nbsp;
The influence
<br>of individuals must always have been a disturbing element.&nbsp; Like
great
<br>writers in later times, there may have been many a barbaric genius
who
<br>taught the men of his tribe to sing or speak, showing them by example
how
<br>to continue or divide their words, charming their souls with rhythm
and
<br>accent and intonation, finding in familiar objects the expression of
their
<br>confused fancies--to whom the whole of language might in truth be said
to
<br>be a figure of speech.&nbsp; One person may have introduced a new custom
into
<br>the formation or pronunciation of a word; he may have been imitated
by
<br>others, and the custom, or form, or accent, or quantity, or rhyme which
he
<br>introduced in a single word may have become the type on which many
other
<br>words or inflexions of words were framed, and may have quickly ran
through
<br>a whole language.&nbsp; For like the other gifts which nature has bestowed
upon
<br>man, that of speech has been conveyed to him through the medium, not
of the
<br>many, but of the few, who were his 'law-givers'--'the legislator with
the
<br>dialectician standing on his right hand,' in Plato's striking image,
who
<br>formed the manners of men and gave them customs, whose voice and look
and
<br>behaviour, whose gesticulations and other peculiarities were instinctively
<br>imitated by them,--the 'king of men' who was their priest, almost their
<br>God...But these are conjectures only:&nbsp; so little do we know of
the origin
<br>of language that the real scholar is indisposed to touch the subject
at
<br>all.
</p><p>(2)&nbsp; There are other errors besides the figment of a primitive
or original
<br>language which it is time to leave behind us.&nbsp; We no longer divide
<br>languages into synthetical and analytical, or suppose similarity of
<br>structure to be the safe or only guide to the affinities of them.&nbsp;
We do
<br>not confuse the parts of speech with the categories of Logic.&nbsp;
Nor do we
<br>conceive languages any more than civilisations to be in a state of
<br>dissolution; they do not easily pass away, but are far more tenacious
of
<br>life than the tribes by whom they are spoken.&nbsp; 'Where two or three
are
<br>gathered together,' they survive.&nbsp; As in the human frame, as in
the state,
<br>there is a principle of renovation as well as of decay which is at
work in
<br>all of them.&nbsp; Neither do we suppose them to be invented by the
wit of man.
<br>With few exceptions, e.g. technical words or words newly imported from
a
<br>foreign language, and the like, in which art has imitated nature, 'words
<br>are not made but grow.'&nbsp; Nor do we attribute to them a supernatural
origin.
<br>The law which regulates them is like the law which governs the circulation
<br>of the blood, or the rising of the sap in trees; the action of it is
<br>uniform, but the result, which appears in the superficial forms of
men and
<br>animals or in the leaves of trees, is an endless profusion and variety.
<br>The laws of vegetation are invariable, but no two plants, no two leaves
of
<br>the forest are precisely the same.&nbsp; The laws of language are invariable,
<br>but no two languages are alike, no two words have exactly the same
meaning.
<br>No two sounds are exactly of the same quality, or give precisely the
same
<br>impression.
</p><p>It would be well if there were a similar consensus about some other
points
<br>which appear to be still in dispute.&nbsp; Is language conscious or
unconscious?
<br>In speaking or writing have we present to our minds the meaning or
the
<br>sound or the construction of the words which we are using?--No more
than
<br>the separate drops of water with which we quench our thirst are present:
<br>the whole draught may be conscious, but not the minute particles of
which
<br>it is made up:&nbsp; So the whole sentence may be conscious, but the
several
<br>words, syllables, letters are not thought of separately when we are
<br>uttering them.&nbsp; Like other natural operations, the process of
speech, when
<br>most perfect, is least observed by us.&nbsp; We do not pause at each
mouthful to
<br>dwell upon the taste of it:&nbsp; nor has the speaker time to ask himself
the
<br>comparative merits of different modes of expression while he is uttering
<br>them.&nbsp; There are many things in the use of language which may
be observed
<br>from without, but which cannot be explained from within.&nbsp; Consciousness
<br>carries us but a little way in the investigation of the mind; it is
not the
<br>faculty of internal observation, but only the dim light which makes
such
<br>observation possible.&nbsp; What is supposed to be our consciousness
of language
<br>is really only the analysis of it, and this analysis admits of innumerable
<br>degrees.&nbsp; But would it not be better if this term, which is so
misleading,
<br>and yet has played so great a part in mental science, were either banished
<br>or used only with the distinct meaning of 'attention to our own minds,'
<br>such as is called forth, not by familiar mental processes, but by the
<br>interruption of them?&nbsp; Now in this sense we may truly say that
we are not
<br>conscious of ordinary speech, though we are commonly roused to attention
by
<br>the misuse or&nbsp; mispronunciation of a word.&nbsp; Still less, even
in schools and
<br>academies, do we ever attempt to invent new words or to alter the meaning
<br>of old ones, except in the case, mentioned above, of technical or borrowed
<br>words which are artificially made or imported because a need of them
is
<br>felt.&nbsp; Neither in our own nor in any other age has the conscious
effort of
<br>reflection in man contributed in an appreciable degree to the formation
of
<br>language.&nbsp; 'Which of us by taking thought' can make new words
or
<br>constructions?&nbsp; Reflection is the least of the causes by which
language is
<br>affected, and is likely to have the least power, when the linguistic
<br>instinct is greatest, as in young children and in the infancy of nations.
</p><p>A kindred error is the separation of the phonetic from the mental element
<br>of language; they are really inseparable--no definite line can be drawn
<br>between them, any more than in any other common act of mind and body.&nbsp;
It
<br>is true that within certain limits we possess the power of varying
sounds
<br>by opening and closing the mouth, by touching the palate or the teeth
with
<br>the tongue, by lengthening or shortening the vocal instrument, by greater
<br>or less stress, by a higher or lower pitch of the voice, and we can
<br>substitute one note or accent for another.&nbsp; But behind the organs
of speech
<br>and their action there remains the informing mind, which sets them
in
<br>motion and works together with them.&nbsp; And behind the great structure
of
<br>human speech and the lesser varieties of language which arise out of
the
<br>many degrees and kinds of human intercourse, there is also the unknown
or
<br>over-ruling law of God or nature which gives order to it in its infinite
<br>greatness, and variety in its infinitesimal minuteness--both equally
<br>inscrutable to us.&nbsp; We need no longer discuss whether philology
is to be
<br>classed with the Natural or the Mental sciences, if we frankly recognize
<br>that, like all the sciences which are concerned with man, it has a
double
<br>aspect,--inward and outward; and that the inward can only be known
through
<br>the outward.&nbsp; Neither need we raise the question whether the laws
of
<br>language, like the other laws of human action, admit of exceptions.&nbsp;
The
<br>answer in all cases is the same--that the laws of nature are uniform,
<br>though the consistency or continuity of them is not always perceptible
to
<br>us.&nbsp; The superficial appearances of language, as of nature, are
irregular,
<br>but we do not therefore deny their deeper uniformity.&nbsp; The comparison
of
<br>the growth of language in the individual and in the nation cannot be
wholly
<br>discarded, for nations are made up of individuals.&nbsp; But in this,
as in the
<br>other political sciences, we must distinguish between collective and
<br>individual actions or processes, and not attribute to the one what
belongs
<br>to the other.&nbsp; Again, when we speak of the hereditary or paternity
of a
<br>language, we must remember that the parents are alive as well as the
<br>children, and that all the preceding generations survive (after a manner)
<br>in the latest form of it.&nbsp; And when, for the purposes of comparison,
we
<br>form into groups the roots or terminations of words, we should not
forget
<br>how casual is the manner in which their resemblances have arisen--they
were
<br>not first written down by a grammarian in the paradigms of a grammar
and
<br>learned out of a book, but were due to many chance attractions of sound
or
<br>of meaning, or of both combined.&nbsp; So many cautions have to be
borne in
<br>mind, and so many first thoughts to be dismissed, before we can proceed
<br>safely in the path of philological enquiry.&nbsp; It might be well
sometimes to
<br>lay aside figures of speech, such as the 'root' and the 'branches,'
the
<br>'stem,' the 'strata' of Geology, the 'compounds' of Chemistry, 'the
ripe
<br>fruit of pronouns dropping from verbs' (see above), and the like, which
are
<br>always interesting, but are apt to be delusive.&nbsp; Yet such figures
of speech
<br>are far nearer the truth than the theories which attribute the invention
<br>and improvement of language to the conscious action of the human
<br>mind...Lastly, it is doubted by recent philologians whether climate
can be
<br>supposed to have exercised any influence worth speaking of on a language:
<br>such a view is said to be unproven:&nbsp; it had better therefore not
be
<br>silently assumed.
</p><p>'Natural selection' and the 'survival of the fittest' have been applied
in
<br>the field of philology, as well as in the other sciences which are
<br>concerned with animal and vegetable life.&nbsp; And a Darwinian school
of
<br>philologists has sprung up, who are sometimes accused of putting words
in
<br>the place of things.&nbsp; It seems to be true, that whether applied
to language
<br>or to other branches of knowledge, the Darwinian theory, unless very
<br>precisely defined, hardly escapes from being a truism.&nbsp; If by
'the natural
<br>selection' of words or meanings of words or by the 'persistence and
<br>survival of the fittest' the maintainer of the theory intends to affirm
<br>nothing more than this--that the word 'fittest to survive' survives,
he
<br>adds not much to the knowledge of language.&nbsp; But if he means that
the word
<br>or the meaning of the word or some portion of the word which comes
into use
<br>or drops out of use is selected or rejected on the ground of economy
or
<br>parsimony or ease to the speaker or clearness or euphony or expressiveness,
<br>or greater or less demand for it, or anything of this sort, he is affirming
<br>a proposition which has several senses, and in none of these senses
can be
<br>assisted to be uniformly true.&nbsp; For the laws of language are precarious,
<br>and can only act uniformly when there is such frequency of intercourse
<br>among neighbours as is sufficient to enforce them.&nbsp; And there
are many
<br>reasons why a man should prefer his own way of speaking to that of
others,
<br>unless by so doing he becomes unintelligible.&nbsp; The struggle for
existence
<br>among words is not of that fierce and irresistible kind in which birds,
<br>beasts and fishes devour one another, but of a milder sort, allowing
one
<br>usage to be substituted for another, not by force, but by the persuasion,
<br>or rather by the prevailing habit, of a majority.&nbsp; The favourite
figure, in
<br>this, as in some other uses of it, has tended rather to obscure than
<br>explain the subject to which it has been applied.&nbsp; Nor in any
case can the
<br>struggle for existence be deemed to be the sole or principal cause
of
<br>changes in language, but only one among many, and one of which we cannot
<br>easily measure the importance.&nbsp; There is a further objection which
may be
<br>urged equally against all applications of the Darwinian theory.&nbsp;
As in
<br>animal life and likewise in vegetable, so in languages, the process
of
<br>change is said to be insensible:&nbsp; sounds, like animals, are supposed
to
<br>pass into one another by imperceptible gradation.&nbsp; But in both
cases the
<br>newly-created forms soon become fixed; there are few if any vestiges
of the
<br>intermediate links, and so the better half of the evidence of the change
is
<br>wanting.
</p><p>(3)&nbsp; Among the incumbrances or illusions of language may be reckoned
many
<br>of the rules and traditions of grammar, whether ancient grammar or
the
<br>corrections of it which modern philology has introduced.&nbsp; Grammar,
like
<br>law, delights in definition:&nbsp; human speech, like human action,
though very
<br>far from being a mere chaos, is indefinite, admits of degrees, and
is
<br>always in a state of change or transition.&nbsp; Grammar gives an erroneous
<br>conception of language:&nbsp; for it reduces to a system that which
is not a
<br>system.&nbsp; Its figures of speech, pleonasms, ellipses, anacolutha,
pros to
<br>semainomenon, and the like have no reality; they do not either make
<br>conscious expressions more intelligible or show the way in which they
have
<br>arisen; they are chiefly designed to bring an earlier use of language
into
<br>conformity with the later.&nbsp; Often they seem intended only to remind
us that
<br>great poets like Aeschylus or Sophocles or Pindar or a great prose
writer
<br>like Thucydides are guilty of taking unwarrantable liberties with
<br>grammatical rules; it appears never to have occurred to the inventors
of
<br>them that these real 'conditores linguae Graecae' lived in an age before
<br>grammar, when 'Greece also was living Greece.'&nbsp; It is the anatomy,
not the
<br>physiology of language, which grammar seeks to describe:&nbsp; into
the idiom
<br>and higher life of words it does not enter.&nbsp; The ordinary Greek
grammar
<br>gives a complete paradigm of the verb, without suggesting that the
double
<br>or treble forms of Perfects, Aorists, etc. are hardly ever contemporaneous.
<br>It distinguishes Moods and Tenses, without observing how much of the
nature
<br>of one passes into the other.&nbsp; It makes three Voices, Active,
Passive, and
<br>Middle, but takes no notice of the precarious existence and uncertain
<br>character of the last of the three.&nbsp; Language is a thing of degrees
and
<br>relations and associations and exceptions:&nbsp; grammar ties it up
in fixed
<br>rules.&nbsp; Language has many varieties of usage:&nbsp; grammar tries
to reduce them
<br>to a single one.&nbsp; Grammar divides verbs into regular and irregular:&nbsp;
it
<br>does not recognize that the irregular, equally with the regular, are
<br>subject to law, and that a language which had no exceptions would not
be a
<br>natural growth:&nbsp; for it could not have been subjected to the influences
by
<br>which language is ordinarily affected.&nbsp; It is always wanting to
describe
<br>ancient languages in the terms of a modern one.&nbsp; It has a favourite
fiction
<br>that one word is put in the place of another; the truth is that no
word is
<br>ever put for another.&nbsp; It has another fiction, that a word has
been
<br>omitted:&nbsp; words are omitted because they are no longer needed;
and the
<br>omission has ceased to be observed.&nbsp; The common explanation of
kata or some
<br>other preposition 'being understood' in a Greek sentence is another
fiction
<br>of the same kind, which tends to disguise the fact that under cases
were
<br>comprehended originally many more relations, and that prepositions
are used
<br>only to define the meaning of them with greater precision.&nbsp; These
instances
<br>are sufficient to show the sort of errors which grammar introduces
into
<br>language.&nbsp; We are not considering the question of its utility
to the
<br>beginner in the study.&nbsp; Even to him the best grammar is the shortest
and
<br>that in which he will have least to unlearn.&nbsp; It may be said that
the
<br>explanations here referred to are already out of date, and that the
study
<br>of Greek grammar has received a new character from comparative philology.
<br>This is true; but it is also true that the traditional grammar has
still a
<br>great hold on the mind of the student.
</p><p>Metaphysics are even more troublesome than the figments of grammar,
because
<br>they wear the appearance of philosophy and there is no test to which
they
<br>can be subjected.&nbsp; They are useful in so far as they give us an
insight
<br>into the history of the human mind and the modes of thought which have
<br>existed in former ages; or in so far as they furnish wider conceptions
of
<br>the different branches of knowledge and of their relation to one another.
<br>But they are worse than useless when they outrun experience and abstract
<br>the mind from the observation of facts, only to envelope it in a mist
of
<br>words.&nbsp; Some philologers, like Schleicher, have been greatly influenced
by
<br>the philosophy of Hegel; nearly all of them to a certain extent have
fallen
<br>under the dominion of physical science.&nbsp; Even Kant himself thought
that the
<br>first principles of philosophy could be elicited from the analysis
of the
<br>proposition, in this respect falling short of Plato.&nbsp; Westphal
holds that
<br>there are three stages of language:&nbsp; (1) in which things were
characterized
<br>independently, (2) in which they were regarded in relation to human
<br>thought, and (3) in relation to one another.&nbsp; But are not such
distinctions
<br>an anachronism? for they imply a growth of abstract ideas which never
<br>existed in early times.&nbsp; Language cannot be explained by Metaphysics;
for
<br>it is prior to them and much more nearly allied to sense.&nbsp; It
is not likely
<br>that the meaning of the cases is ultimately resolvable into relations
of
<br>space and time.&nbsp; Nor can we suppose the conception of cause and
effect or
<br>of the finite and infinite or of the same and other to be latent in
<br>language at a time when in their abstract form they had never entered
into
<br>the mind of man...If the science of Comparative Philology had possessed
<br>'enough of Metaphysics to get rid of Metaphysics,' it would have made
far
<br>greater progress.
</p><p>(4) Our knowledge of language is almost confined to languages which
are
<br>fully developed.&nbsp; They are of several patterns; and these become
altered by
<br>admixture in various degrees,--they may only borrow a few words from
one
<br>another and retain their life comparatively unaltered, or they may
meet in
<br>a struggle for existence until one of the two is overpowered and retires
<br>from the field.&nbsp; They attain the full rights and dignity of language
when
<br>they acquire the use of writing and have a literature of their own;
they
<br>pass into dialects and grow out of them, in proportion as men are isolated
<br>or united by locality or occupation.&nbsp; The common language sometimes
reacts
<br>upon the dialects and imparts to them also a literary character.&nbsp;
The laws
<br>of language can be best discerned in the great crises of language,
<br>especially in the transitions from ancient to modern forms of them,
whether
<br>in Europe or Asia.&nbsp; Such changes are the silent notes of the world's
<br>history; they mark periods of unknown length in which war and conquest
were
<br>running riot over whole continents, times of suffering too great to
be
<br>endured by the human race, in which the masters became subjects and
the
<br>subject races masters, in which driven by necessity or impelled by
some
<br>instinct, tribes or nations left their original homes and but slowly
found
<br>a resting-place.&nbsp; Language would be the greatest of all historical
<br>monuments, if it could only tell us the history of itself.
</p><p>(5) There are many ways in which we may approach this study.&nbsp; The
simplest
<br>of all is to observe our own use of language in conversation or in
writing,
<br>how we put words together, how we construct and connect sentences,
what are
<br>the rules of accent and rhythm in verse or prose, the formation and
<br>composition of words, the laws of euphony and sound, the affinities
of
<br>letters, the mistakes to which we are ourselves most liable of spelling
or
<br>pronunciation.&nbsp; We may compare with our own language some other,
even when
<br>we have only a slight knowledge of it, such as French or German.&nbsp;
Even a
<br>little Latin will enable us to appreciate the grand difference between
<br>ancient and modern European languages.&nbsp; In the child learning
to speak we
<br>may note the inherent strength of language, which like 'a mountain
river'
<br>is always forcing its way out.&nbsp; We may witness the delight in
imitation and
<br>repetition, and some of the laws by which sounds pass into one another.&nbsp;
We
<br>may learn something also from the falterings of old age, the searching
for
<br>words, and the confusion of them with one another, the forgetfulness
of
<br>proper names (more commonly than of other words because they are more
<br>isolated), aphasia, and the like.&nbsp; There are philological lessons
also to
<br>be gathered from nicknames, from provincialisms, from the slang of
great
<br>cities, from the argot of Paris (that language of suffering and crime,
so
<br>pathetically described by Victor Hugo), from the imperfect articulation
of
<br>the deaf and dumb, from the jabbering of animals, from the analysis
of
<br>sounds in relation to the organs of speech.&nbsp; The phonograph affords
a
<br>visible evidence of the nature and divisions of sound; we may be truly
said
<br>to know what we can manufacture.&nbsp; Artificial languages, such as
that of
<br>Bishop Wilkins, are chiefly useful in showing what language is not.&nbsp;
The
<br>study of any foreign language may be made also a study of Comparative
<br>Philology.&nbsp; There are several points, such as the nature of irregular
<br>verbs, of indeclinable parts of speech, the influence of euphony, the
decay
<br>or loss of inflections, the elements of syntax, which may be examined
as
<br>well in the history of our own language as of any other.&nbsp; A few
well-
<br>selected questions may lead the student at once into the heart of the
<br>mystery:&nbsp; such as, Why are the pronouns and the verb of existence
generally
<br>more irregular than any other parts of speech?&nbsp; Why is the number
of words
<br>so small in which the sound is an echo of the sense?&nbsp; Why does
the meaning
<br>of words depart so widely from their etymology?&nbsp; Why do substantives
often
<br>differ in meaning from the verbs to which they are related, adverbs
from
<br>adjectives?&nbsp; Why do words differing in origin coalesce in the
same sound
<br>though retaining their differences of meaning?&nbsp; Why are some verbs
<br>impersonal?&nbsp; Why are there only so many parts of speech, and on
what
<br>principle are they divided?&nbsp; These are a few crucial questions
which give
<br>us an insight from different points of view into the true nature of
<br>language.
</p><p>(6) Thus far we have been endeavouring to strip off from language the
false
<br>appearances in which grammar and philology, or the love of system
<br>generally, have clothed it.&nbsp; We have also sought to indicate the
sources of
<br>our knowledge of it and the spirit in which we should approach it,
we may
<br>now proceed to consider some of the principles or natural laws which
have
<br>created or modified it.
</p><p>i.&nbsp; The first and simplest of all the principles of language, common
also
<br>to the animals, is imitation.&nbsp; The lion roars, the wolf howls
in the
<br>solitude of the forest:&nbsp; they are answered by similar cries heard
from a
<br>distance.&nbsp; The bird, too, mimics the voice of man and makes answer
to him.
<br>Man tells to man the secret place in which he is hiding himself; he
<br>remembers and repeats the sound which he has heard.&nbsp; The love
of imitation
<br>becomes a passion and an instinct to him.&nbsp; Primitive men learnt
to speak
<br>from one another, like a child from its mother or nurse.&nbsp; They
learnt of
<br>course a rudimentary, half-articulate language, the cry or song or
speech
<br>which was the expression of what we now call human thoughts and feelings.
<br>We may still remark how much greater and more natural the exercise
of the
<br>power is in the use of language than in any other process or action
of the
<br>human mind.
</p><p>ii.&nbsp; Imitation provided the first material of language:&nbsp; but
it was
<br>'without form and void.'&nbsp; During how many years or hundreds or
thousands of
<br>years the imitative or half-articulate stage continued there is no
<br>possibility of determining.&nbsp; But we may reasonably conjecture
that there
<br>was a time when the vocal utterance of man was intermediate between
what we
<br>now call language and the cry of a bird or animal.&nbsp; Speech before
language
<br>was a rudis indigestaque materies, not yet distributed into words and
<br>sentences, in which the cry of fear or joy mingled with more definite
<br>sounds recognized by custom as the expressions of things or events.&nbsp;
It was
<br>the principle of analogy which introduced into this 'indigesta moles'
order
<br>and measure.&nbsp; It was Anaxagoras' omou panta chremata, eita nous
elthon
<br>diekosmese:&nbsp; the light of reason lighted up all things and at
once began to
<br>arrange them.&nbsp; In every sentence, in every word and every termination
of a
<br>word, this power of forming relations to one another was contained.&nbsp;
There
<br>was a proportion of sound to sound, of meaning to meaning, of meaning
to
<br>sound.&nbsp; The cases and numbers of nouns, the persons, tenses, numbers
of
<br>verbs, were generally on the same or nearly the same pattern and had
the
<br>same meaning.&nbsp; The sounds by which they were expressed were rough-hewn
at
<br>first; after a while they grew more refined--the natural laws of euphony
<br>began to affect them.&nbsp; The rules of syntax are likewise based
upon analogy.
<br>Time has an analogy with space, arithmetic with geometry.&nbsp; Not
only in
<br>musical notes, but in the quantity, quality, accent, rhythm of human
<br>speech, trivial or serious, there is a law of proportion.&nbsp; As
in things of
<br>beauty, as in all nature, in the composition as well as in the motion
of
<br>all things, there is a similarity of relations by which they are held
<br>together.
</p><p>It would be a mistake to suppose that the analogies of language are
always
<br>uniform:&nbsp; there may be often a choice between several, and sometimes
one
<br>and sometimes another will prevail.&nbsp; In Greek there are three
declensions
<br>of nouns; the forms of cases in one of them may intrude upon another.
<br>Similarly verbs in -omega and -mu iota interchange forms of tenses,
and the
<br>completed paradigm of the verb is often made up of both.&nbsp; The
same nouns
<br>may be partly declinable and partly indeclinable, and in some of their
<br>cases may have fallen out of use.&nbsp; Here are rules with exceptions;
they are
<br>not however really exceptions, but contain in themselves indications
of
<br>other rules.&nbsp; Many of these interruptions or variations of analogy
occur in
<br>pronouns or in the verb of existence of which the forms were too common
and
<br>therefore too deeply imbedded in language entirely to drop out.&nbsp;
The same
<br>verbs in the same meaning may sometimes take one case, sometimes another.
<br>The participle may also have the character of an adjective, the adverb
<br>either of an adjective or of a preposition.&nbsp; These exceptions
are as
<br>regular as the rules, but the causes of them are seldom known to us.
</p><p>Language, like the animal and vegetable worlds, is everywhere intersected
<br>by the lines of analogy.&nbsp; Like number from which it seems to be
derived,
<br>the principle of analogy opens the eyes of men to discern the similarities
<br>and differences of things, and their relations to one another.&nbsp;
At first
<br>these are such as lie on the surface only; after a time they are seen
by
<br>men to reach farther down into the nature of things.&nbsp; Gradually
in language
<br>they arrange themselves into a sort of imperfect system; groups of
personal
<br>and case endings are placed side by side.&nbsp; The fertility of language
<br>produces many more than are wanted; and the superfluous ones are utilized
<br>by the assignment to them of new meanings.&nbsp; The vacuity and the
superfluity
<br>are thus partially compensated by each other.&nbsp; It must be remembered
that
<br>in all the languages which have a literature, certainly in Sanskrit,
Greek,
<br>Latin, we are not at the beginning but almost at the end of the linguistic
<br>process; we have reached a time when the verb and the noun are nearly
<br>perfected, though in no language did they completely perfect themselves,
<br>because for some unknown reason the motive powers of languages seem
to have
<br>ceased when they were on the eve of completion:&nbsp; they became fixed
or
<br>crystallized in an imperfect form either from the influence of writing
and
<br>literature, or because no further differentiation of them was required
for
<br>the intelligibility of language.&nbsp; So not without admixture and
confusion
<br>and displacement and contamination of sounds and the meanings of words,
a
<br>lower stage of language passes into a higher.&nbsp; Thus far we can
see and no
<br>further.&nbsp; When we ask the reason why this principle of analogy
prevails in
<br>all the vast domain of language, there is no answer to the question;
or no
<br>other answer but this, that there are innumerable ways in which, like
<br>number, analogy permeates, not only language, but the whole world,
both
<br>visible and intellectual.&nbsp; We know from experience that it does
not (a)
<br>arise from any conscious act of reflection that the accusative of a
Latin
<br>noun in 'us' should end in 'um;' nor (b) from any necessity of being
<br>understood,--much less articulation would suffice for this; nor (c)
from
<br>greater convenience or expressiveness of particular sounds.&nbsp; Such
notions
<br>were certainly far enough away from the mind of primitive man.&nbsp;
We may
<br>speak of a latent instinct, of a survival of the fittest, easiest,
most
<br>euphonic, most economical of breath, in the case of one of two competing
<br>sounds; but these expressions do not add anything to our knowledge.&nbsp;
We may
<br>try to grasp the infinity of language either under the figure of a
<br>limitless plain divided into countries and districts by natural boundaries,
<br>or of a vast river eternally flowing whose origin is concealed from
us; we
<br>may apprehend partially the laws by which speech is regulated:&nbsp;
but we do
<br>not know, and we seem as if we should never know, any more than in
the
<br>parallel case of the origin of species, how vocal sounds received life
and
<br>grew, and in the form of languages came to be distributed over the
earth.
</p><p>iii.&nbsp; Next in order to analogy in the formation of language or
even prior
<br>to it comes the principle of onomatopea, which is itself a kind of
analogy
<br>or similarity of sound and meaning.&nbsp; In by far the greater number
of words
<br>it has become disguised and has disappeared; but in no stage of language
is
<br>it entirely lost.&nbsp; It belongs chiefly to early language, in which
words
<br>were few; and its influence grew less and less as time went on.&nbsp;
To the ear
<br>which had a sense of harmony it became a barbarism which disturbed
the flow
<br>and equilibrium of discourse; it was an excrescence which had to be
cut
<br>out, a survival which needed to be got rid of, because it was out of
<br>keeping with the rest.&nbsp; It remained for the most part only as
a formative
<br>principle, which used words and letters not as crude imitations of
other
<br>natural sounds, but as symbols of ideas which were naturally associated
<br>with them.&nbsp; It received in another way a new character; it affected
not so
<br>much single words, as larger portions of human speech.&nbsp; It regulated
the
<br>juxtaposition of sounds and the cadence of sentences.&nbsp; It was
the music,
<br>not of song, but of speech, in prose as well as verse.&nbsp; The old
onomatopea
<br>of primitive language was refined into an onomatopea of a higher kind,
in
<br>which it is no longer true to say that a particular sound corresponds
to a
<br>motion or action of man or beast or movement of nature, but that in
all the
<br>higher uses of language the sound is the echo of the sense, especially
in
<br>poetry, in which beauty and expressiveness are given to human thoughts
by
<br>the harmonious composition of the words, syllables, letters, accents,
<br>quantities, rhythms, rhymes, varieties and contrasts of all sorts.&nbsp;
The
<br>poet with his 'Break, break, break' or his e pasin nekuessi
<br>kataphthimenoisin anassein or his 'longius ex altoque sinum trahit,'
can
<br>produce a far finer music than any crude imitations of things or actions
in
<br>sound, although a letter or two having this imitative power may be
a lesser
<br>element of beauty in such passages.&nbsp; The same subtle sensibility,
which
<br>adapts the word to the thing, adapts the sentence or cadence to the
general
<br>meaning or spirit of the passage.&nbsp; This is the higher onomatopea
which has
<br>banished the cruder sort as unworthy to have a place in great languages
and
<br>literatures.
</p><p>We can see clearly enough that letters or collocations of letters do
by
<br>various degrees of strength or weakness, length or shortness, emphasis
or
<br>pitch, become the natural expressions of the finer parts of human feeling
<br>or thought.&nbsp; And not only so, but letters themselves have a significance;
<br>as Plato observes that the letter rho accent is expressive of motion,
the
<br>letters delta and tau of binding and rest, the letter lambda of smoothness,
<br>nu of inwardness, the letter eta of length, the letter omicron of
<br>roundness.&nbsp; These were often combined so as to form composite
notions, as
<br>for example in tromos (trembling), trachus (rugged), thrauein (crush),
<br>krouein (strike), thruptein (break), pumbein (whirl),--in all which
words
<br>we notice a parallel composition of sounds in their English equivalents.
<br>Plato also remarks, as we remark, that the onomatopoetic principle
is far
<br>from prevailing uniformly, and further that no explanation of language
<br>consistently corresponds with any system of philosophy, however great
may
<br>be the light which language throws upon the nature of the mind.&nbsp;
Both in
<br>Greek and English we find groups of words such as string, swing, sling,
<br>spring, sting, which are parallel to one another and may be said to
derive
<br>their vocal effect partly from contrast of letters, but in which it
is
<br>impossible to assign a precise amount of meaning to each of the expressive
<br>and onomatopoetic letters.&nbsp; A few of them are directly imitative,
as for
<br>example the omega in oon, which represents the round form of the egg
by the
<br>figure of the mouth:&nbsp; or bronte (thunder), in which the fulness
of the
<br>sound of the word corresponds to the thing signified by it; or bombos
<br>(buzzing), of which the first syllable, as in its English equivalent,
has
<br>the meaning of a deep sound.&nbsp; We may observe also (as we see in
the case of
<br>the poor stammerer) that speech has the co-operation of the whole body
and
<br>may be often assisted or half expressed by gesticulation.&nbsp; A sound
or word
<br>is not the work of the vocal organs only; nearly the whole of the upper
<br>part of the human frame, including head, chest, lungs, have a share
in
<br>creating it; and it may be accompanied by a movement of the eyes, nose,
<br>fingers, hands, feet which contributes to the effect of it.
</p><p>The principle of onomatopea has fallen into discredit, partly because
it
<br>has been supposed to imply an actual manufacture of words out of syllables
<br>and letters, like a piece of joiner's work,--a theory of language which
is
<br>more and more refuted by facts, and more and more going out of fashion
with
<br>philologians; and partly also because the traces of onomatopea in separate
<br>words become almost obliterated in the course of ages.&nbsp; The poet
of
<br>language cannot put in and pull out letters, as a painter might insert
or
<br>blot out a shade of colour to give effect to his picture.&nbsp; It
would be
<br>ridiculous for him to alter any received form of a word in order to
render
<br>it more expressive of the sense.&nbsp; He can only select, perhaps
out of some
<br>dialect, the form which is already best adapted to his purpose.&nbsp;
The true
<br>onomatopea is not a creative, but a formative principle, which in the
later
<br>stage of the history of language ceases to act upon individual words;
but
<br>still works through the collocation of them in the sentence or paragraph,
<br>and the adaptation of every word, syllable, letter to one another and
to
<br>the rhythm of the whole passage.
</p><p>iv.&nbsp; Next, under a distinct head, although not separable from the
<br>preceding, may be considered the differentiation of languages, i.e.
the
<br>manner in which differences of meaning and form have arisen in them.&nbsp;
Into
<br>their first creation we have ceased to enquire:&nbsp; it is their aftergrowth
<br>with which we are now concerned.&nbsp; How did the roots or substantial
portions
<br>of words become modified or inflected? and how did they receive separate
<br>meanings?&nbsp; First we remark that words are attracted by the sounds
and
<br>senses of other words, so that they form groups of nouns and verbs
<br>analogous in sound and sense to one another, each noun or verb putting
<br>forth inflexions, generally of two or three patterns, and with exceptions.
<br>We do not say that we know how sense became first allied to sound;
but we
<br>have no difficulty in ascertaining how the sounds and meanings of words
<br>were in time parted off or differentiated.&nbsp; (1) The chief causes
which
<br>regulate the variations of sound are (a) double or differing analogies,
<br>which lead sometimes to one form, sometimes to another (b) euphony,
by
<br>which is meant chiefly the greater pleasure to the ear and the greater
<br>facility to the organs of speech which is given by a new formation
or
<br>pronunciation of a word (c) the necessity of finding new expressions
for
<br>new classes or processes of things.&nbsp; We are told that changes
of sound take
<br>place by innumerable gradations until a whole tribe or community or
society
<br>find themselves acquiescing in a new pronunciation or use of language.&nbsp;
Yet
<br>no one observes the change, or is at all aware that in the course of
a
<br>lifetime he and his contemporaries have appreciably varied their intonation
<br>or use of words.&nbsp; On the other hand, the necessities of language
seem to
<br>require that the intermediate sounds or meanings of words should quickly
<br>become fixed or set and not continue in a state of transition.&nbsp;
The process
<br>of settling down is aided by the organs of speech and by the use of
writing
<br>and printing.&nbsp; (2) The meaning of words varies because ideas vary
or the
<br>number of things which is included under them or with which they are
<br>associated is increased.&nbsp; A single word is thus made to do duty
for many
<br>more things than were formerly expressed by it; and it parts into different
<br>senses when the classes of things or ideas which are represented by
it are
<br>themselves different and distinct.&nbsp; A figurative use of a word
may easily
<br>pass into a new sense:&nbsp; a new meaning caught up by association
may become
<br>more important than all the rest.&nbsp; The good or neutral sense of
a word,
<br>such as Jesuit, Puritan, Methodist, Heretic, has been often converted
into
<br>a bad one by the malevolence of party spirit.&nbsp; Double forms suggest
<br>different meanings and are often used to express them; and the form
or
<br>accent of a word has been not unfrequently altered when there is a
<br>difference of meaning.&nbsp; The difference of gender in nouns is utilized
for
<br>the same reason.&nbsp; New meanings of words push themselves into the
vacant
<br>spaces of language and retire when they are no longer needed.&nbsp;
Language
<br>equally abhors vacancy and superfluity.&nbsp; But the remedial measures
by which
<br>both are eliminated are not due to any conscious action of the human
mind;
<br>nor is the force exerted by them constraining or necessary.
</p><p>(7) We have shown that language, although subject to laws, is far from
<br>being of an exact and uniform nature.&nbsp; We may now speak briefly
of the
<br>faults of language.&nbsp; They may be compared to the faults of Geology,
in
<br>which different strata cross one another or meet at an angle, or mix
with
<br>one another either by slow transitions or by violent convulsions, leaving
<br>many lacunae which can be no longer filled up, and often becoming so
<br>complex that no true explanation of them can be given.&nbsp; So in
language
<br>there are the cross influences of meaning and sound, of logic and grammar,
<br>of differing analogies, of words and the inflexions of words, which
often
<br>come into conflict with each other.&nbsp; The grammarian, if he were
to form new
<br>words, would make them all of the same pattern according to what he
<br>conceives to be the rule, that is, the more common usage of language.&nbsp;
The
<br>subtlety of nature goes far beyond art, and it is complicated by
<br>irregularity, so that often we can hardly say that there is a right
or
<br>wrong in the formation of words.&nbsp; For almost any formation which
is not at
<br>variance with the first principles of language is possible and may
be
<br>defended.
</p><p>The imperfection of language is really due to the formation and correlation
<br>of words by accident, that is to say, by principles which are unknown
to
<br>us.&nbsp; Hence we see why Plato, like ourselves unable to comprehend
the whole
<br>of language, was constrained to 'supplement the poor creature imitation
by
<br>another poor creature convention.'&nbsp; But the poor creature convention
in the
<br>end proves too much for all the rest:&nbsp; for we do not ask what
is the origin
<br>of words or whether they are formed according to a correct analogy,
but
<br>what is the usage of them; and we are compelled to admit with Hermogenes
in
<br>Plato and with Horace that usage is the ruling principle, 'quem penes
<br>arbitrium est, et jus et norma loquendi.'
</p><p>(8) There are two ways in which a language may attain permanence or
fixity.
<br>First, it may have been embodied in poems or hymns or laws, which may
be
<br>repeated for hundreds, perhaps for thousands of years with a religious
<br>accuracy, so that to the priests or rhapsodists of a nation the whole
or
<br>the greater part of a language is literally preserved; secondly, it
may be
<br>written down and in a written form distributed more or less widely
among
<br>the whole nation.&nbsp; In either case the language which is familiarly
spoken
<br>may have grown up wholly or in a great measure independently of them.&nbsp;
(1)
<br>The first of these processes has been sometimes attended by the result
that
<br>the sound of the words has been carefully preserved and that the meaning
of
<br>them has either perished wholly, or is only doubtfully recovered by
the
<br>efforts of modern philology.&nbsp; The verses have been repeated as
a chant or
<br>part of a ritual, but they have had no relation to ordinary life or
speech.
<br>(2) The invention of writing again is commonly attributed to a particular
<br>epoch, and we are apt to think that such an inestimable gift would
have
<br>immediately been diffused over a whole country.&nbsp; But it may have
taken a
<br>long time to perfect the art of writing, and another long period may
have
<br>elapsed before it came into common use.&nbsp; Its influence on language
has been
<br>increased ten, twenty or one hundred fold by the invention of printing.
</p><p>Before the growth of poetry or the invention of writing, languages were
<br>only dialects.&nbsp; So they continued to be in parts of the country
in which
<br>writing was not used or in which there was no diffusion of literature.&nbsp;
In
<br>most of the counties of England there is still a provincial style,
which
<br>has been sometimes made by a great poet the vehicle of his fancies.&nbsp;
When a
<br>book sinks into the mind of a nation, such as Luther's Bible or the
<br>Authorized English Translation of the Bible, or again great classical
works
<br>like Shakspere or Milton, not only have new powers of expression been
<br>diffused through a whole nation, but a great step towards uniformity
has
<br>been made.&nbsp; The instinct of language demands regular grammar and
correct
<br>spelling:&nbsp; these are imprinted deeply on the tablets of a nation's
memory
<br>by a common use of classical and popular writers.&nbsp; In our own
day we have
<br>attained to a point at which nearly every printed book is spelt correctly
<br>and written grammatically.
</p><p>(9) Proceeding further to trace the influence of literature on language
we
<br>note some other causes which have affected the higher use of it:&nbsp;
such as
<br>(1) the necessity of clearness and connexion; (2) the fear of tautology;
<br>(3) the influence of metre, rhythm, rhyme, and of the language of prose
and
<br>verse upon one another; (4) the power of idiom and quotation; (5) the
<br>relativeness of words to one another.
</p><p>It has been usual to depreciate modern languages when compared with
<br>ancient.&nbsp; The latter are regarded as furnishing a type of excellence
to
<br>which the former cannot attain.&nbsp; But the truth seems to be that
modern
<br>languages, if through the loss of inflections and genders they lack
some
<br>power or beauty or expressiveness or precision which is possessed by
the
<br>ancient, are in many other respects superior to them:&nbsp; the thought
is
<br>generally clearer, the connexion closer, the sentence and paragraph
are
<br>better distributed.&nbsp; The best modern languages, for example English
or
<br>French, possess as great a power of self-improvement as the Latin,
if not
<br>as the Greek.&nbsp; Nor does there seem to be any reason why they should
ever
<br>decline or decay.&nbsp; It is a popular remark that our great writers
are
<br>beginning to disappear:&nbsp; it may also be remarked that whenever
a great
<br>writer appears in the future he will find the English language as perfect
<br>and as ready for use as in the days of Shakspere or Milton.&nbsp; There
is no
<br>reason to suppose that English or French will ever be reduced to the
low
<br>level of Modern Greek or of Mediaeval Latin.&nbsp; The wide diffusion
of great
<br>authors would make such a decline impossible.&nbsp; Nor will modern
languages be
<br>easily broken up by amalgamation with each other.&nbsp; The distance
between
<br>them is too wide to be spanned, the differences are too great to be
<br>overcome, and the use of printing makes it impossible that one of them
<br>should ever be lost in another.
</p><p>The structure of the English language differs greatly from that of either
<br>Latin or Greek.&nbsp; In the two latter, especially in Greek, sentences
are
<br>joined together by connecting particles.&nbsp; They are distributed
on the right
<br>hand and on the left by men, de, alla, kaitoi, kai de and the like,
or
<br>deduced from one another by ara, de, oun, toinun and the like.&nbsp;
In English
<br>the majority of sentences are independent and in apposition to one
another;
<br>they are laid side by side or slightly connected by the copula.&nbsp;
But within
<br>the sentence the expression of the logical relations of the clauses
is
<br>closer and more exact:&nbsp; there is less of apposition and participial
<br>structure.&nbsp; The sentences thus laid side by side are also constructed
into
<br>paragraphs; these again are less distinctly marked in Greek and Latin
than
<br>in English.&nbsp; Generally French, German, and English have an advantage
over
<br>the classical languages in point of accuracy.&nbsp; The three concords
are more
<br>accurately observed in English than in either Greek or Latin.&nbsp;
On the other
<br>hand, the extension of the familiar use of the masculine and feminine
<br>gender to objects of sense and abstract ideas as well as to men and
animals
<br>no doubt lends a nameless grace to style which we have a difficulty
in
<br>appreciating, and the possible variety in the order of words gives
more
<br>flexibility and also a kind of dignity to the period.&nbsp; Of the
comparative
<br>effect of accent and quantity and of the relation between them in ancient
<br>and modern languages we are not able to judge.
</p><p>Another quality in which modern are superior to ancient languages is
<br>freedom from tautology.&nbsp; No English style is thought tolerable
in which,
<br>except for the sake of emphasis, the same words are repeated at short
<br>intervals.&nbsp; Of course the length of the interval must depend on
the
<br>character of the word.&nbsp; Striking words and expressions cannot
be allowed to
<br>reappear, if at all, except at the distance of a page or more.&nbsp;
Pronouns,
<br>prepositions, conjunctions may or rather must recur in successive lines.
<br>It seems to be a kind of impertinence to the reader and strikes
<br>unpleasantly both on the mind and on the ear that the same sounds should
be
<br>used twice over, when another word or turn of expression would have
given a
<br>new shade of meaning to the thought and would have added a pleasing
variety
<br>to the sound.&nbsp; And the mind equally rejects the repetition of
the word and
<br>the use of a mere synonym for it,--e.g. felicity and happiness.&nbsp;
The
<br>cultivated mind desires something more, which a skilful writer is easily
<br>able to supply out of his treasure-house.
</p><p>The fear of tautology has doubtless led to the multiplications of words
and
<br>the meanings of words, and generally to an enlargement of the vocabulary.
<br>It is a very early instinct of language; for ancient poetry is almost
as
<br>free from tautology as the best modern writings.&nbsp; The speech of
young
<br>children, except in so far as they are compelled to repeat themselves
by
<br>the fewness of their words, also escapes from it.&nbsp; When they grow
up and
<br>have ideas which are beyond their powers of expression, especially
in
<br>writing, tautology begins to appear.&nbsp; In like manner when language
is
<br>'contaminated' by philosophy it is apt to become awkward, to stammer
and
<br>repeat itself, to lose its flow and freedom.&nbsp; No philosophical
writer with
<br>the exception of Plato, who is himself not free from tautology, and
perhaps
<br>Bacon, has attained to any high degree of literary excellence.
</p><p>To poetry the form and polish of language is chiefly to be attributed;
and
<br>the most critical period in the history of language is the transition
from
<br>verse to prose.&nbsp; At first mankind were contented to express their
thoughts
<br>in a set form of words having a kind of rhythm; to which regularity
was
<br>given by accent and quantity.&nbsp; But after a time they demanded
a greater
<br>degree of freedom, and to those who had all their life been hearing
poetry
<br>the first introduction of prose had the charm of novelty.&nbsp; The
prose
<br>romances into which the Homeric Poems were converted, for a while probably
<br>gave more delight to the hearers or readers of them than the Poems
<br>themselves, and in time the relation of the two was reversed:&nbsp;
the poems
<br>which had once been a necessity of the human mind became a luxury:&nbsp;
they
<br>were now superseded by prose, which in all succeeding ages became the
<br>natural vehicle of expression to all mankind.&nbsp; Henceforward prose
and
<br>poetry formed each other.&nbsp; A comparatively slender link between
them was
<br>also furnished by proverbs.&nbsp; We may trace in poetry how the simple
<br>succession of lines, not without monotony, has passed into a complicated
<br>period, and how in prose, rhythm and accent and the order of words
and the
<br>balance of clauses, sometimes not without a slight admixture of rhyme,
make
<br>up a new kind of harmony, swelling into strains not less majestic than
<br>those of Homer, Virgil, or Dante.
</p><p>One of the most curious and characteristic features of language, affecting
<br>both syntax and style, is idiom.&nbsp; The meaning of the word 'idiom'
is that
<br>which is peculiar, that which is familiar, the word or expression which
<br>strikes us or comes home to us, which is more readily understood or
more
<br>easily remembered.&nbsp; It is a quality which really exists in infinite
<br>degrees, which we turn into differences of kind by applying the term
only
<br>to conspicuous and striking examples of words or phrases which have
this
<br>quality.&nbsp; It often supersedes the laws of language or the rules
of grammar,
<br>or rather is to be regarded as another law of language which is natural
and
<br>necessary.&nbsp; The word or phrase which has been repeated many times
over is
<br>more intelligible and familiar to us than one which is rare, and our
<br>familiarity with it more than compensates for incorrectness or inaccuracy
<br>in the use of it.&nbsp; Striking expressions also which have moved
the hearts of
<br>nations or are the precious stones and jewels of great authors partake
of
<br>the nature of idioms:&nbsp; they are taken out of the sphere of grammar
and are
<br>exempt from the proprieties of language.&nbsp; Every one knows that
we often put
<br>words together in a manner which would be intolerable if it were not
<br>idiomatic.&nbsp; We cannot argue either about the meaning of words
or the use of
<br>constructions that because they are used in one connexion they will
be
<br>legitimate in another, unless we allow for this principle.&nbsp; We
can bear to
<br>have words and sentences used in new senses or in a new order or even
a
<br>little perverted in meaning when we are quite familiar with them.
<br>Quotations are as often applied in a sense which the author did not
intend
<br>as in that which he did.&nbsp; The parody of the words of Shakspere
or of the
<br>Bible, which has in it something of the nature of a lie, is far from
<br>unpleasing to us.&nbsp; The better known words, even if their meaning
be
<br>perverted, are more agreeable to us and have a greater power over us.&nbsp;
Most
<br>of us have experienced a sort of delight and feeling of curiosity when
we
<br>first came across or when we first used for ourselves a new word or
phrase
<br>or figure of speech.
</p><p>There are associations of sound and of sense by which every word is
linked
<br>to every other.&nbsp; One letter harmonizes with another; every verb
or noun
<br>derives its meaning, not only from itself, but from the words with
which it
<br>is associated.&nbsp; Some reflection of them near or distant is embodied
in it.
<br>In any new use of a word all the existing uses of it have to be considered.
<br>Upon these depends the question whether it will bear the proposed extension
<br>of meaning or not.&nbsp; According to the famous expression of Luther,
'Words
<br>are living creatures, having hands and feet.'&nbsp; When they cease
to retain
<br>this living power of adaptation, when they are only put together like
the
<br>parts of a piece of furniture, language becomes unpoetical, in expressive,
<br>dead.
</p><p>Grammars would lead us to suppose that words have a fixed form and sound.
<br>Lexicons assign to each word a definite meaning or meanings.&nbsp;
They both
<br>tend to obscure the fact that the sentence precedes the word and that
all
<br>language is relative.&nbsp; (1) It is relative to its own context.&nbsp;
Its meaning
<br>is modified by what has been said before and after in the same or in
some
<br>other passage:&nbsp; without comparing the context we are not sure
whether it is
<br>used in the same sense even in two successive sentences.&nbsp; (2)
It is
<br>relative to facts, to time, place, and occasion:&nbsp; when they are
already
<br>known to the hearer or reader, they may be presupposed; there is no
need to
<br>allude to them further.&nbsp; (3) It is relative to the knowledge of
the writer
<br>and reader or of the speaker and hearer.&nbsp; Except for the sake
of order and
<br>consecutiveness nothing ought to be expressed which is already commonly
or
<br>universally known.&nbsp; A word or two may be sufficient to give an
intimation
<br>to a friend; a long or elaborate speech or composition is required
to
<br>explain some new idea to a popular audience or to the ordinary reader
or to
<br>a young pupil.&nbsp; Grammars and dictionaries are not to be despised;
for in
<br>teaching we need clearness rather than subtlety.&nbsp; But we must
not therefore
<br>forget that there is also a higher ideal of language in which all is
<br>relative--sounds to sounds, words to words, the parts to the whole--in
<br>which besides the lesser context of the book or speech, there is also
the
<br>larger context of history and circumstances.
</p><p>The study of Comparative Philology has introduced into the world a new
<br>science which more than any other binds up man with nature, and distant
<br>ages and countries with one another.&nbsp; It may be said to have thrown
a light
<br>upon all other sciences and upon the nature of the human mind itself.&nbsp;
The
<br>true conception of it dispels many errors, not only of metaphysics
and
<br>theology, but also of natural knowledge.&nbsp; Yet it is far from certain
that
<br>this newly-found science will continue to progress in the same surprising
<br>manner as heretofore; or that even if our materials are largely increased,
<br>we shall arrive at much more definite conclusions than at present.&nbsp;
Like
<br>some other branches of knowledge, it may be approaching a point at
which it
<br>can no longer be profitably studied.&nbsp; But at any rate it has brought
back
<br>the philosophy of language from theory to fact; it has passed out of
the
<br>region of guesses and hypotheses, and has attained the dignity of an
<br>Inductive Science.&nbsp; And it is not without practical and political
<br>importance.&nbsp; It gives a new interest to distant and subject countries;
it
<br>brings back the dawning light from one end of the earth to the other.
<br>Nations, like individuals, are better understood by us when we know
<br>something of their early life; and when they are better understood
by us,
<br>we feel more kindly towards them.&nbsp; Lastly, we may remember that
all
<br>knowledge is valuable for its own sake; and we may also hope that a
deeper
<br>insight into the nature of human speech will give us a greater command
of
<br>it and enable us to make a nobler use of it.&nbsp; (Compare again W.
Humboldt,
<br>'Ueber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues;' M. Muller,
<br>'Lectures on the Science of Language;' Steinthal, 'Einleitung in die
<br>Psychologie und Sprachwissenschaft:' and for the latter part of the
Essay,
<br>Delbruck, 'Study of Language;' Paul's 'Principles of the History of
<br>Language:'&nbsp; to the latter work the author of this Essay is largely
<br>indebted.)

</p><p>CRATYLUS
</p><p>by
</p><p>Plato
</p><p>Translated by Benjamin Jowett
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:&nbsp; Socrates, Hermogenes, Cratylus.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Suppose that we make Socrates a party to the argument?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; If you please.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should explain to you, Socrates, that our friend
Cratylus
<br>has been arguing about names; he says that they are natural and not
<br>conventional; not a portion of the human voice which men agree to use;
but
<br>that there is a truth or correctness in them, which is the same for
<br>Hellenes as for barbarians.&nbsp; Whereupon I ask him, whether his
own name of
<br>Cratylus is a true name or not, and he answers 'Yes.'&nbsp; And Socrates?
<br>'Yes.'&nbsp; Then every man's name, as I tell him, is that which he
is called.
<br>To this he replies--'If all the world were to call you Hermogenes,
that
<br>would not be your name.'&nbsp; And when I am anxious to have a further
<br>explanation he is ironical and mysterious, and seems to imply that
he has a
<br>notion of his own about the matter, if he would only tell, and could
<br>entirely convince me, if he chose to be intelligible.&nbsp; Tell me,
Socrates,
<br>what this oracle means; or rather tell me, if you will be so good,
what is
<br>your own view of the truth or correctness of names, which I would far
<br>sooner hear.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Son of Hipponicus, there is an ancient saying, that
'hard is the
<br>knowledge of the good.'&nbsp; And the knowledge of names is a great
part of
<br>knowledge.&nbsp; If I had not been poor, I might have heard the fifty-drachma
<br>course of the great Prodicus, which is a complete education in grammar
and
<br>language--these are his own words--and then I should have been at once
able
<br>to answer your question about the correctness of names.&nbsp; But,
indeed, I
<br>have only heard the single-drachma course, and therefore, I do not
know the
<br>truth about such matters; I will, however, gladly assist you and Cratylus
<br>in the investigation of them.&nbsp; When he declares that your name
is not
<br>really Hermogenes, I suspect that he is only making fun of you;--he
means
<br>to say that you are no true son of Hermes, because you are always looking
<br>after a fortune and never in luck.&nbsp; But, as I was saying, there
is a good
<br>deal of difficulty in this sort of knowledge, and therefore we had
better
<br>leave the question open until we have heard both sides.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I have often talked over this matter, both with Cratylus
and
<br>others, and cannot convince myself that there is any principle of
<br>correctness in names other than convention and agreement; any name
which
<br>you give, in my opinion, is the right one, and if you change that and
give
<br>another, the new name is as correct as the old--we frequently change
the
<br>names of our slaves, and the newly-imposed name is as good as the old:&nbsp;
for
<br>there is no name given to anything by nature; all is convention and
habit
<br>of the users;--such is my view.&nbsp; But if I am mistaken I shall
be happy to
<br>hear and learn of Cratylus, or of any one else.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I dare say that you may be right, Hermogenes:&nbsp;
let us see;--Your
<br>meaning is, that the name of each thing is only that which anybody
agrees
<br>to call it?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is my notion.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Whether the giver of the name be an individual or a
city?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, now, let me take an instance;--suppose that I
call a man a
<br>horse or a horse a man, you mean to say that a man will be rightly
called a
<br>horse by me individually, and rightly called a man by the rest of the
<br>world; and a horse again would be rightly called a man by me and a
horse by
<br>the world:--that is your meaning?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; He would, according to my view.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But how about truth, then? you would acknowledge that
there is
<br>in words a true and a false?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And there are true and false propositions?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; To be sure.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And a true proposition says that which is, and a false
<br>proposition says that which is not?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes; what other answer is possible?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then in a proposition there is a true and false?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But is a proposition true as a whole only, and are the
parts
<br>untrue?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No; the parts are true as well as the whole.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Would you say the large parts and not the smaller ones,
or every
<br>part?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should say that every part is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Is a proposition resolvable into any part smaller than
a name?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No; that is the smallest.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the name is a part of the true proposition?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, and a true part, as you say.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is not the part of a falsehood also a falsehood?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then, if propositions may be true and false, names may
be true
<br>and false?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; So we must infer.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the name of anything is that which any one affirms
to be the
<br>name?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And will there be so many names of each thing as everybody
says
<br>that there are? and will they be true names at the time of uttering
them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, I can conceive no correctness of names
other
<br>than this; you give one name, and I another; and in different cities
and
<br>countries there are different names for the same things; Hellenes differ
<br>from barbarians in their use of names, and the several Hellenic tribes
from
<br>one another.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But would you say, Hermogenes, that the things differ
as the
<br>names differ? and are they relative to individuals, as Protagoras tells
us?
<br>For he says that man is the measure of all things, and that things
are to
<br>me as they appear to me, and that they are to you as they appear to
you.
<br>Do you agree with him, or would you say that things have a permanent
<br>essence of their own?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There have been times, Socrates, when I have been
driven in my
<br>perplexity to take refuge with Protagoras; not that I agree with him
at
<br>all.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What! have you ever been driven to admit that there
was no such
<br>thing as a bad man?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No, indeed; but I have often had reason to think that
there
<br>are very bad men, and a good many of them.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, and have you ever found any very good ones?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Not many.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Still you have found them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And would you hold that the very good were the very
wise, and
<br>the very evil very foolish?&nbsp; Would that be your view?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; It would.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But if Protagoras is right, and the truth is that things
are as
<br>they appear to any one, how can some of us be wise and some of us foolish?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Impossible.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And if, on the other hand, wisdom and folly are really
<br>distinguishable, you will allow, I think, that the assertion of Protagoras
<br>can hardly be correct.&nbsp; For if what appears to each man is true
to him, one
<br>man cannot in reality be wiser than another.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; He cannot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Nor will you be disposed to say with Euthydemus, that
all things
<br>equally belong to all men at the same moment and always; for neither
on his
<br>view can there be some good and others bad, if virtue and vice are
always
<br>equally to be attributed to all.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There cannot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But if neither is right, and things are not relative
to
<br>individuals, and all things do not equally belong to all at the same
moment
<br>and always, they must be supposed to have their own proper and permanent
<br>essence:&nbsp; they are not in relation to us, or influenced by us,
fluctuating
<br>according to our fancy, but they are independent, and maintain to their
own
<br>essence the relation prescribed by nature.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think, Socrates, that you have said the truth.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Does what I am saying apply only to the things themselves,
or
<br>equally to the actions which proceed from them?&nbsp; Are not actions
also a
<br>class of being?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, the actions are real as well as the things.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the actions also are done according to their proper
nature,
<br>and not according to our opinion of them?&nbsp; In cutting, for example,
we do
<br>not cut as we please, and with any chance instrument; but we cut with
the
<br>proper instrument only, and according to the natural process of cutting;
<br>and the natural process is right and will succeed, but any other will
fail
<br>and be of no use at all.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should say that the natural way is the right way.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Again, in burning, not every way is the right way; but
the right
<br>way is the natural way, and the right instrument the natural instrument.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And this holds good of all actions?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And speech is a kind of action?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And will a man speak correctly who speaks as he pleases?&nbsp;
Will
<br>not the successful speaker rather be he who speaks in the natural way
of
<br>speaking, and as things ought to be spoken, and with the natural
<br>instrument?&nbsp; Any other mode of speaking will result in error and
failure.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I quite agree with you.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is not naming a part of speaking? for in giving
names men
<br>speak.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And if speaking is a sort of action and has a relation
to acts,
<br>is not naming also a sort of action?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And we saw that actions were not relative to ourselves,
but had
<br>a special nature of their own?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Precisely.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the argument would lead us to infer that names
ought to be
<br>given according to a natural process, and with a proper instrument,
and not
<br>at our pleasure:&nbsp; in this and no other way shall we name with
success.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I agree.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But again, that which has to be cut has to be cut with
<br>something?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And that which has to be woven or pierced has to be
woven or
<br>pierced with something?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And that which has to be named has to be named with
something?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What is that with which we pierce?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; An awl.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And with which we weave?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; A shuttle.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And with which we name?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; A name.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Very good:&nbsp; then a name is an instrument?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Suppose that I ask, 'What sort of instrument is a shuttle?'&nbsp;
And
<br>you answer, 'A weaving instrument.'
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Well.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And I ask again, 'What do we do when we weave?'--The
answer is,
<br>that we separate or disengage the warp from the woof.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And may not a similar description be given of an awl,
and of
<br>instruments in general?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; To be sure.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And now suppose that I ask a similar question about
names:&nbsp; will
<br>you answer me?&nbsp; Regarding the name as an instrument, what do we
do when we
<br>name?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I cannot say.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Do we not give information to one another, and distinguish
<br>things according to their natures?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly we do.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then a name is an instrument of teaching and of distinguishing
<br>natures, as the shuttle is of distinguishing the threads of the web.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the shuttle is the instrument of the weaver?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Assuredly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the weaver will use the shuttle well--and well
means like a
<br>weaver? and the teacher will use the name well--and well means like
a
<br>teacher?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And when the weaver uses the shuttle, whose work will
he be
<br>using well?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That of the carpenter.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is every man a carpenter, or the skilled only?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Only the skilled.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And when the piercer uses the awl, whose work will he
be using
<br>well?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That of the smith.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is every man a smith, or only the skilled?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; The skilled only.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And when the teacher uses the name, whose work will
he be using?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There again I am puzzled.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Cannot you at least say who gives us the names which
we use?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Indeed I cannot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Does not the law seem to you to give us them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, I suppose so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the teacher, when he gives us a name, uses the
work of the
<br>legislator?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I agree.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is every man a legislator, or the skilled only?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; The skilled only.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then, Hermogenes, not every man is able to give a name,
but only
<br>a maker of names; and this is the legislator, who of all skilled artisans
<br>in the world is the rarest.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And how does the legislator make names? and to what
does he
<br>look?&nbsp; Consider this in the light of the previous instances:&nbsp;
to what does
<br>the carpenter look in making the shuttle?&nbsp; Does he not look to
that which
<br>is naturally fitted to act as a shuttle?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And suppose the shuttle to be broken in making, will
he make
<br>another, looking to the broken one? or will he look to the form according
<br>to which he made the other?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; To the latter, I should imagine.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Might not that be justly called the true or ideal shuttle?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And whatever shuttles are wanted, for the manufacture
of
<br>garments, thin or thick, of flaxen, woollen, or other material, ought
all
<br>of them to have the true form of the shuttle; and whatever is the shuttle
<br>best adapted to each kind of work, that ought to be the form which
the
<br>maker produces in each case.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the same holds of other instruments:&nbsp; when
a man has
<br>discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work,
he must
<br>express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the
<br>material, whatever it may be, which he employs; for example, he ought
to
<br>know how to put into iron the forms of awls adapted by nature to their
<br>several uses?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And how to put into wood forms of shuttles adapted by
nature to
<br>their uses?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; For the several forms of shuttles naturally answer to
the
<br>several kinds of webs; and this is true of instruments in general.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then, as to names:&nbsp; ought not our legislator also
to know how to
<br>put the true natural name of each thing into sounds and syllables,
and to
<br>make and give all names with a view to the ideal name, if he is to
be a
<br>namer in any true sense?&nbsp; And we must remember that different
legislators
<br>will not use the same syllables.&nbsp; For neither does every smith,
although he
<br>may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all
of
<br>the same iron.&nbsp; The form must be the same, but the material may
vary, and
<br>still the instrument may be equally good of whatever iron made, whether
in
<br>Hellas or in a foreign country;--there is no difference.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the legislator, whether he be Hellene or barbarian,
is not
<br>therefore to be deemed by you a worse legislator, provided he gives
the
<br>true and proper form of the name in whatever syllables; this or that
<br>country makes no matter.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Quite true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But who then is to determine whether the proper form
is given to
<br>the shuttle, whatever sort of wood may be used? the carpenter who makes,
or
<br>the weaver who is to use them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should say, he who is to use them, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And who uses the work of the lyre-maker?&nbsp; Will
not he be the man
<br>who knows how to direct what is being done, and who will know also
whether
<br>the work is being well done or not?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And who is he?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; The player of the lyre.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And who will direct the shipwright?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; The pilot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And who will be best able to direct the legislator in
his work,
<br>and will know whether the work is well done, in this or any other country?
<br>Will not the user be the man?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And this is he who knows how to ask questions?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And how to answer them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And him who knows how to ask and answer you would call
a
<br>dialectician?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes; that would be his name.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the work of the carpenter is to make a rudder,
and the
<br>pilot has to direct him, if the rudder is to be well made.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the work of the legislator is to give names, and
the
<br>dialectician must be his director if the names are to be rightly given?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then, Hermogenes, I should say that this giving of names
can be
<br>no such light matter as you fancy, or the work of light or chance persons;
<br>and Cratylus is right in saying that things have names by nature, and
that
<br>not every man is an artificer of names, but he only who looks to the
name
<br>which each thing by nature has, and is able to express the true forms
of
<br>things in letters and syllables.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I cannot answer you, Socrates; but I find a difficulty
in
<br>changing my opinion all in a moment, and I think that I should be more
<br>readily persuaded, if you would show me what this is which you term
the
<br>natural fitness of names.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; My good Hermogenes, I have none to show.&nbsp; Was I
not telling you
<br>just now (but you have forgotten), that I knew nothing, and proposing
to
<br>share the enquiry with you?&nbsp; But now that you and I have talked
over the
<br>matter, a step has been gained; for we have discovered that names have
by
<br>nature a truth, and that not every man knows how to give a thing a
name.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very good.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And what is the nature of this truth or correctness
of names?
<br>That, if you care to know, is the next question.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly, I care to know.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then reflect.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How shall I reflect?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The true way is to have the assistance of those who
know, and
<br>you must pay them well both in money and in thanks; these are the Sophists,
<br>of whom your brother, Callias, has--rather dearly--bought the reputation
of
<br>wisdom.&nbsp; But you have not yet come into your inheritance, and
therefore you
<br>had better go to him, and beg and entreat him to tell you what he has
<br>learnt from Protagoras about the fitness of names.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But how inconsistent should I be, if, whilst repudiating
<br>Protagoras and his truth ('Truth' was the title of the book of Protagoras;
<br>compare Theaet.), I were to attach any value to what he and his book
<br>affirm!
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then if you despise him, you must learn of Homer and
the poets.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; And where does Homer say anything about names, and
what does
<br>he say?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; He often speaks of them; notably and nobly in the places
where
<br>he distinguishes the different names which Gods and men give to the
same
<br>things.&nbsp; Does he not in these passages make a remarkable statement
about
<br>the correctness of names?&nbsp; For the Gods must clearly be supposed
to call
<br>things by their right and natural names; do you not think so?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Why, of course they call them rightly, if they call
them at
<br>all.&nbsp; But to what are you referring?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Do you not know what he says about the river in Troy
who had a
<br>single combat with Hephaestus?
</p><p>'Whom,' as he says, 'the Gods call Xanthus, and men call Scamander.'
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I remember.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, and about this river--to know that he ought to
be called
<br>Xanthus and not Scamander--is not that a solemn lesson?&nbsp; Or about
the bird
<br>which, as he says,
</p><p>'The Gods call Chalcis, and men Cymindis:'
</p><p>to be taught how much more correct the name Chalcis is than the name
<br>Cymindis--do you deem that a light matter?&nbsp; Or about Batieia and
Myrina?
<br>(Compare Il. 'The hill which men call Batieia and the immortals the
tomb of
<br>the sportive Myrina.')&nbsp; And there are many other observations
of the same
<br>kind in Homer and other poets.&nbsp; Now, I think that this is beyond
the
<br>understanding of you and me; but the names of Scamandrius and Astyanax,
<br>which he affirms to have been the names of Hector's son, are more within
<br>the range of human faculties, as I am disposed to think; and what the
poet
<br>means by correctness may be more readily apprehended in that instance:&nbsp;
you
<br>will remember I dare say the lines to which I refer?&nbsp; (Il.)
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I do.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Let me ask you, then, which did Homer think the more
correct of
<br>the names given to Hector's son--Astyanax or Scamandrius?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I do not know.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; How would you answer, if you were asked whether the
wise or the
<br>unwise are more likely to give correct names?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should say the wise, of course.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And are the men or the women of a city, taken as a class,
the
<br>wiser?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should say, the men.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And Homer, as you know, says that the Trojan men called
him
<br>Astyanax (king of the city); but if the men called him Astyanax, the
other
<br>name of Scamandrius could only have been given to him by the women.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That may be inferred.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And must not Homer have imagined the Trojans to be wiser
than
<br>their wives?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; To be sure.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then he must have thought Astyanax to be a more correct
name for
<br>the boy than Scamandrius?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Clearly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And what is the reason of this?&nbsp; Let us consider:--does
he not
<br>himself suggest a very good reason, when he says,
</p><p>'For he alone defended their city and long walls'?
</p><p>This appears to be a good reason for calling the son of the saviour
king of
<br>the city which his father was saving, as Homer observes.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I see.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Why, Hermogenes, I do not as yet see myself; and do
you?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No, indeed; not I.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But tell me, friend, did not Homer himself also give
Hector his
<br>name?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What of that?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The name appears to me to be very nearly the same as
the name of
<br>Astyanax--both are Hellenic; and a king (anax) and a holder (ektor)
have
<br>nearly the same meaning, and are both descriptive of a king; for a
man is
<br>clearly the holder of that of which he is king; he rules, and owns,
and
<br>holds it.&nbsp; But, perhaps, you may think that I am talking nonsense;
and
<br>indeed I believe that I myself did not know what I meant when I imagined
<br>that I had found some indication of the opinion of Homer about the
<br>correctness of names.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I assure you that I think otherwise, and I believe
you to be
<br>on the right track.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; There is reason, I think, in calling the lion's whelp
a lion,
<br>and the foal of a horse a horse; I am speaking only of the ordinary
course
<br>of nature, when an animal produces after his kind, and not of extraordinary
<br>births;--if contrary to nature a horse have a calf, then I should not
call
<br>that a foal but a calf; nor do I call any inhuman birth a man, but
only a
<br>natural birth.&nbsp; And the same may be said of trees and other things.&nbsp;
Do you
<br>agree with me?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, I agree.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; But you had better watch me and see
that I do not
<br>play tricks with you.&nbsp; For on the same principle the son of a
king is to be
<br>called a king.&nbsp; And whether the syllables of the name are the
same or not
<br>the same, makes no difference, provided the meaning is retained; nor
does
<br>the addition or subtraction of a letter make any difference so long
as the
<br>essence of the thing remains in possession of the name and appears
in it.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; A very simple matter.&nbsp; I may illustrate my meaning
by the names
<br>of letters, which you know are not the same as the letters themselves
with
<br>the exception of the four epsilon, upsilon, omicron, omega; the names
of
<br>the rest, whether vowels or consonants, are made up of other letters
which
<br>we add to them; but so long as we introduce the meaning, and there
can be
<br>no mistake, the name of the letter is quite correct.&nbsp; Take, for
example,
<br>the letter beta--the addition of eta, tau, alpha, gives no offence,
and
<br>does not prevent the whole name from having the value which the legislator
<br>intended--so well did he know how to give the letters names.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I believe you are right.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And may not the same be said of a king? a king will
often be the
<br>son of a king, the good son or the noble son of a good or noble sire;
and
<br>similarly the offspring of every kind, in the regular course of nature,
is
<br>like the parent, and therefore has the same name.&nbsp; Yet the syllables
may be
<br>disguised until they appear different to the ignorant person, and he
may
<br>not recognize them, although they are the same, just as any one of
us would
<br>not recognize the same drugs under different disguises of colour and
smell,
<br>although to the physician, who regards the power of them, they are
the
<br>same, and he is not put out by the addition; and in like manner the
<br>etymologist is not put out by the addition or transposition or subtraction
<br>of a letter or two, or indeed by the change of all the letters, for
this
<br>need not interfere with the meaning.&nbsp; As was just now said, the
names of
<br>Hector and Astyanax have only one letter alike, which is tau, and yet
they
<br>have the same meaning.&nbsp; And how little in common with the letters
of their
<br>names has Archepolis (ruler of the city)--and yet the meaning is the
same.
<br>And there are many other names which just mean 'king.'&nbsp; Again,
there are
<br>several names for a general, as, for example, Agis (leader) and Polemarchus
<br>(chief in war) and Eupolemus (good warrior); and others which denote
a
<br>physician, as Iatrocles (famous healer) and Acesimbrotus (curer of
<br>mortals); and there are many others which might be cited, differing
in
<br>their syllables and letters, but having the same meaning.&nbsp; Would
you not
<br>say so?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The same names, then, ought to be assigned to those
who follow
<br>in the course of nature?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And what of those who follow out of the course of nature,
and
<br>are prodigies? for example, when a good and religious man has an
<br>irreligious son, he ought to bear the name not of his father, but of
the
<br>class to which he belongs, just as in the case which was before supposed
of
<br>a horse foaling a calf.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Quite true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the irreligious son of a religious father should
be called
<br>irreligious?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; He should not be called Theophilus (beloved of God)
or
<br>Mnesitheus (mindful of God), or any of these names:&nbsp; if names
are correctly
<br>given, his should have an opposite meaning.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Again, Hermogenes, there is Orestes (the man of the
mountains)
<br>who appears to be rightly called; whether chance gave the name, or
perhaps
<br>some poet who meant to express the brutality and fierceness and mountain
<br>wildness of his hero's nature.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is very likely, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And his father's name is also according to nature.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Clearly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, for as his name, so also is his nature; Agamemnon
<br>(admirable for remaining) is one who is patient and persevering in
the
<br>accomplishment of his resolves, and by his virtue crowns them; and
his
<br>continuance at Troy with all the vast army is a proof of that admirable
<br>endurance in him which is signified by the name Agamemnon.&nbsp; I
also think
<br>that Atreus is rightly called; for his murder of Chrysippus and his
<br>exceeding cruelty to Thyestes are damaging and destructive to his
<br>reputation--the name is a little altered and disguised so as not to
be
<br>intelligible to every one, but to the etymologist there is no difficulty
in
<br>seeing the meaning, for whether you think of him as ateires the stubborn,
<br>or as atrestos the fearless, or as ateros the destructive one, the
name is
<br>perfectly correct in every point of view.&nbsp; And I think that Pelops
is also
<br>named appropriately; for, as the name implies, he is rightly called
Pelops
<br>who sees what is near only (o ta pelas oron).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Because, according to the tradition, he had no forethought
or
<br>foresight of all the evil which the murder of Myrtilus would entail
upon
<br>his whole race in remote ages; he saw only what was at hand and immediate,
<br>--or in other words, pelas (near), in his eagerness to win Hippodamia
by
<br>all means for his bride.&nbsp; Every one would agree that the name
of Tantalus
<br>is rightly given and in accordance with nature, if the traditions about
him
<br>are true.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; And what are the traditions?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Many terrible misfortunes are said to have happened
to him in
<br>his life--last of all, came the utter ruin of his country; and after
his
<br>death he had the stone suspended (talanteia) over his head in the world
<br>below--all this agrees wonderfully well with his name.&nbsp; You might
imagine
<br>that some person who wanted to call him Talantatos (the most weighted
down
<br>by misfortune), disguised the name by altering it into Tantalus; and
into
<br>this form, by some accident of tradition, it has actually been transmuted.
<br>The name of Zeus, who is his alleged father, has also an excellent
meaning,
<br>although hard to be understood, because really like a sentence, which
is
<br>divided into two parts, for some call him Zena, and use the one half,
and
<br>others who use the other half call him Dia; the two together signify
the
<br>nature of the God, and the business of a name, as we were saying, is
to
<br>express the nature.&nbsp; For there is none who is more the author
of life to us
<br>and to all, than the lord and king of all.&nbsp; Wherefore we are right
in
<br>calling him Zena and Dia, which are one name, although divided, meaning
the
<br>God through whom all creatures always have life (di on zen aei pasi
tois
<br>zosin uparchei).&nbsp; There is an irreverence, at first sight, in
calling him
<br>son of Cronos (who is a proverb for stupidity), and we might rather
expect
<br>Zeus to be the child of a mighty intellect.&nbsp; Which is the fact;
for this is
<br>the meaning of his father's name:&nbsp; Kronos quasi Koros (Choreo,
to sweep),
<br>not in the sense of a youth, but signifying to chatharon chai acheraton
tou
<br>nou, the pure and garnished mind (sc. apo tou chorein).&nbsp; He, as
we are
<br>informed by tradition, was begotten of Uranus, rightly so called (apo
tou
<br>oran ta ano) from looking upwards; which, as philosophers tell us,
is the
<br>way to have a pure mind, and the name Uranus is therefore correct.&nbsp;
If I
<br>could remember the genealogy of Hesiod, I would have gone on and tried
more
<br>conclusions of the same sort on the remoter ancestors of the Gods,--then
I
<br>might have seen whether this wisdom, which has come to me all in an
<br>instant, I know not whence, will or will not hold good to the end.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; You seem to me, Socrates, to be quite like a prophet
newly
<br>inspired, and to be uttering oracles.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, Hermogenes, and I believe that I caught the inspiration
<br>from the great Euthyphro of the Prospaltian deme, who gave me a long
<br>lecture which commenced at dawn:&nbsp; he talked and I listened, and
his wisdom
<br>and enchanting ravishment has not only filled my ears but taken possession
<br>of my soul,and to-day I shall let his superhuman power work and finish
the
<br>investigation of names--that will be the way; but to-morrow, if you
are so
<br>disposed, we will conjure him away, and make a purgation of him, if
we can
<br>only find some priest or sophist who is skilled in purifications of
this
<br>sort.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; With all my heart; for am very curious to hear the
rest of the
<br>enquiry about names.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then let us proceed; and where would you have us begin,
now that
<br>we have got a sort of outline of the enquiry?&nbsp; Are there any names
which
<br>witness of themselves that they are not given arbitrarily, but have
a
<br>natural fitness?&nbsp; The names of heroes and of men in general are
apt to be
<br>deceptive because they are often called after ancestors with whose
names,
<br>as we were saying, they may have no business; or they are the expression
of
<br>a wish like Eutychides (the son of good fortune), or Sosias (the Saviour),
<br>or Theophilus (the beloved of God), and others.&nbsp; But I think that
we had
<br>better leave these, for there will be more chance of finding correctness
in
<br>the names of immutable essences;--there ought to have been more care
taken
<br>about them when they were named, and perhaps there may have been some
more
<br>than human power at work occasionally in giving them names.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think so, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Ought we not to begin with the consideration of the
Gods, and
<br>show that they are rightly named Gods?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, that will be well.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; My notion would be something of this sort:--I suspect
that the
<br>sun, moon, earth, stars, and heaven, which are still the Gods of many
<br>barbarians, were the only Gods known to the aboriginal Hellenes.&nbsp;
Seeing
<br>that they were always moving and running, from their running nature
they
<br>were called Gods or runners (Theous, Theontas); and when men became
<br>acquainted with the other Gods, they proceeded to apply the same name
to
<br>them all.&nbsp; Do you think that likely?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think it very likely indeed.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What shall follow the Gods?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Must not demons and heroes and men come next?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Demons!&nbsp; And what do you consider to be the meaning
of this
<br>word?&nbsp; Tell me if my view is right.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Let me hear.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You know how Hesiod uses the word?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I do not.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Do you not remember that he speaks of a golden race
of men who
<br>came first?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, I do.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; He says of them--
</p><p>'But now that fate has closed over this race
<br>They are holy demons upon the earth,
<br>Beneficent, averters of ills, guardians of mortal men.'&nbsp; (Hesiod,
Works and
<br>Days.)
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What is the inference?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What is the inference!&nbsp; Why, I suppose that he
means by the
<br>golden men, not men literally made of gold, but good and noble; and
I am
<br>convinced of this, because he further says that we are the iron race.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And do you not suppose that good men of our own day
would by him
<br>be said to be of golden race?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very likely.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And are not the good wise?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, they are wise.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And therefore I have the most entire conviction that
he called
<br>them demons, because they were daemones (knowing or wise), and in our
older
<br>Attic dialect the word itself occurs.&nbsp; Now he and other poets
say truly,
<br>that when a good man dies he has honour and a mighty portion among
the
<br>dead, and becomes a demon; which is a name given to him signifying
wisdom.
<br>And I say too, that every wise man who happens to be a good man is
more
<br>than human (daimonion) both in life and death, and is rightly called
a
<br>demon.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Then I rather think that I am of one mind with you;
but what
<br>is the meaning of the word 'hero'?&nbsp; (Eros with an eta, in the
old writing
<br>eros with an epsilon.)
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I think that there is no difficulty in explaining, for
the name
<br>is not much altered, and signifies that they were born of love.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Do you not know that the heroes are demigods?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What then?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; All of them sprang either from the love of a God for
a mortal
<br>woman, or of a mortal man for a Goddess; think of the word in the old
<br>Attic, and you will see better that the name heros is only a slight
<br>alteration of Eros, from whom the heroes sprang:&nbsp; either this
is the
<br>meaning, or, if not this, then they must have been skilful as rhetoricians
<br>and dialecticians, and able to put the question (erotan), for eirein
is
<br>equivalent to legein.&nbsp; And therefore, as I was saying, in the
Attic dialect
<br>the heroes turn out to be rhetoricians and questioners.&nbsp; All this
is easy
<br>enough; the noble breed of heroes are a tribe of sophists and rhetors.&nbsp;
But
<br>can you tell me why men are called anthropoi?--that is more difficult.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No, I cannot; and I would not try even if I could,
because I
<br>think that you are the more likely to succeed.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is to say, you trust to the inspiration of Euthyphro.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Of course.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Your faith is not vain; for at this very moment a new
and
<br>ingenious thought strikes me, and, if I am not careful, before to-morrow's
<br>dawn I shall be wiser than I ought to be.&nbsp; Now, attend to me;
and first,
<br>remember that we often put in and pull out letters in words, and give
names
<br>as we please and change the accents.&nbsp; Take, for example, the word
Dii
<br>Philos; in order to convert this from a sentence into a noun, we omit
one
<br>of the iotas and sound the middle syllable grave instead of acute;
as, on
<br>the other hand, letters are sometimes inserted in words instead of
being
<br>omitted, and the acute takes the place of the grave.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The name anthropos, which was once a sentence, and is
now a
<br>noun, appears to be a case just of this sort, for one letter, which
is the
<br>alpha, has been omitted, and the acute on the last syllable has been
<br>changed to a grave.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I mean to say that the word 'man' implies that other
animals
<br>never examine, or consider, or look up at what they see, but that man
not
<br>only sees (opope) but considers and looks up at that which he sees,
and
<br>hence he alone of all animals is rightly anthropos, meaning anathron
a
<br>opopen.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; May I ask you to examine another word about which
I am
<br>curious?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I will take that which appears to me to follow next
in order.
<br>You know the distinction of soul and body?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Of course.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Let us endeavour to analyze them like the previous
words.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You want me first of all to examine the natural fitness
of the
<br>word psuche (soul), and then of the word soma (body)?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; If I am to say what occurs to me at the moment, I should
imagine
<br>that those who first used the name psuche meant to express that the
soul
<br>when in the body is the source of life, and gives the power of breath
and
<br>revival (anapsuchon), and when this reviving power fails then the body
<br>perishes and dies, and this, if I am not mistaken, they called psyche.&nbsp;
But
<br>please stay a moment; I fancy that I can discover something which will
be
<br>more acceptable to the disciples of Euthyphro, for I am afraid that
they
<br>will scorn this explanation.&nbsp; What do you say to another?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Let me hear.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What is that which holds and carries and gives life
and motion
<br>to the entire nature of the body?&nbsp; What else but the soul?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Just that.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And do you not believe with Anaxagoras, that mind or
soul is the
<br>ordering and containing principle of all things?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes; I do.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then you may well call that power phuseche which carries
and
<br>holds nature (e phusin okei, kai ekei), and this may be refined away
into
<br>psuche.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly; and this derivation is, I think, more scientific
<br>than the other.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; It is so; but I cannot help laughing, if I am to suppose
that
<br>this was the true meaning of the name.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But what shall we say of the next word?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You mean soma (the body).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That may be variously interpreted; and yet more variously
if a
<br>little permutation is allowed.&nbsp; For some say that the body is
the grave
<br>(sema) of the soul which may be thought to be buried in our present
life;
<br>or again the index of the soul, because the soul gives indications
to
<br>(semainei) the body; probably the Orphic poets were the inventors of
the
<br>name, and they were under the impression that the soul is suffering
the
<br>punishment of sin, and that the body is an enclosure or prison in which
the
<br>soul is incarcerated, kept safe (soma, sozetai), as the name soma implies,
<br>until the penalty is paid; according to this view, not even a letter
of the
<br>word need be changed.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think, Socrates, that we have said enough of this
class of
<br>words.&nbsp; But have we any more explanations of the names of the
Gods, like
<br>that which you were giving of Zeus?&nbsp; I should like to know whether
any
<br>similar principle of correctness is to be applied to them.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, indeed, Hermogenes; and there is one excellent
principle
<br>which, as men of sense, we must acknowledge,--that of the Gods we know
<br>nothing, either of their natures or of the names which they give
<br>themselves; but we are sure that the names by which they call themselves,
<br>whatever they may be, are true.&nbsp; And this is the best of all principles;
<br>and the next best is to say, as in prayers, that we will call them
by any
<br>sort or kind of names or patronymics which they like, because we do
not
<br>know of any other.&nbsp; That also, I think, is a very good custom,
and one
<br>which I should much wish to observe.&nbsp; Let us, then, if you please,
in the
<br>first place announce to them that we are not enquiring about them;
we do
<br>not presume that we are able to do so; but we are enquiring about the
<br>meaning of men in giving them these names,--in this there can be small
<br>blame.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think, Socrates, that you are quite right, and I
would like
<br>to do as you say.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Shall we begin, then, with Hestia, according to custom?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, that will be very proper.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What may we suppose him to have meant who gave the name
Hestia?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is another and certainly a most difficult question.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; My dear Hermogenes, the first imposers of names must
surely have
<br>been considerable persons; they were philosophers, and had a good deal
to
<br>say.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Well, and what of them?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; They are the men to whom I should attribute the imposition
of
<br>names.&nbsp; Even in foreign names, if you analyze them, a meaning
is still
<br>discernible.&nbsp; For example, that which we term ousia is by some
called esia,
<br>and by others again osia.&nbsp; Now that the essence of things should
be called
<br>estia, which is akin to the first of these (esia = estia), is rational
<br>enough.&nbsp; And there is reason in the Athenians calling that estia
which
<br>participates in ousia.&nbsp; For in ancient times we too seem to have
said esia
<br>for ousia, and this you may note to have been the idea of those who
<br>appointed that sacrifices should be first offered to estia, which was
<br>natural enough if they meant that estia was the essence of things.&nbsp;
Those
<br>again who read osia seem to have inclined to the opinion of Heracleitus,
<br>that all things flow and nothing stands; with them the pushing principle
<br>(othoun) is the cause and ruling power of all things, and is therefore
<br>rightly called osia.&nbsp; Enough of this, which is all that we who
know nothing
<br>can affirm.&nbsp; Next in order after Hestia we ought to consider Rhea
and
<br>Cronos, although the name of Cronos has been already discussed.&nbsp;
But I dare
<br>say that I am talking great nonsense.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Why, Socrates?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; My good friend, I have discovered a hive of wisdom.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Of what nature?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, rather ridiculous, and yet plausible.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How plausible?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I fancy to myself Heracleitus repeating wise traditions
of
<br>antiquity as old as the days of Cronos and Rhea, and of which Homer
also
<br>spoke.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are in
motion and
<br>nothing at rest; he compares them to the stream of a river, and says
that
<br>you cannot go into the same water twice.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, then, how can we avoid inferring that he who gave
the
<br>names of Cronos and Rhea to the ancestors of the Gods, agreed pretty
much
<br>in the doctrine of Heracleitus?&nbsp; Is the giving of the names of
streams to
<br>both of them purely accidental?&nbsp; Compare the line in which Homer,
and, as I
<br>believe, Hesiod also, tells of
</p><p>'Ocean, the origin of Gods, and mother Tethys (Il.--the line is not
found
<br>in the extant works of Hesiod.).'
</p><p>And again, Orpheus says, that
</p><p>'The fair river of Ocean was the first to marry, and he espoused his
sister
<br>Tethys, who was his mother's daughter.'
</p><p>You see that this is a remarkable coincidence, and all in the direction
of
<br>Heracleitus.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think that there is something in what you say, Socrates;
but
<br>I do not understand the meaning of the name Tethys.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, that is almost self-explained, being only the
name of a
<br>spring, a little disguised; for that which is strained and filtered
<br>(diattomenon, ethoumenon) may be likened to a spring, and the name
Tethys
<br>is made up of these two words.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; The idea is ingenious, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; To be sure.&nbsp; But what comes next?--of Zeus we have
spoken.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then let us next take his two brothers, Poseidon and
Pluto,
<br>whether the latter is called by that or by his other name.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; By all means.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Poseidon is Posidesmos, the chain of the feet; the original
<br>inventor of the name had been stopped by the watery element in his
walks,
<br>and not allowed to go on, and therefore he called the ruler of this
element
<br>Poseidon; the epsilon was probably inserted as an ornament.&nbsp; Yet,
perhaps,
<br>not so; but the name may have been originally written with a double
lamda
<br>and not with a sigma, meaning that the God knew many things (Polla
eidos).
<br>And perhaps also he being the shaker of the earth, has been named from
<br>shaking (seiein), and then pi and delta have been added.&nbsp; Pluto
gives
<br>wealth (Ploutos), and his name means the giver of wealth, which comes
out
<br>of the earth beneath.&nbsp; People in general appear to imagine that
the term
<br>Hades is connected with the invisible (aeides) and so they are led
by their
<br>fears to call the God Pluto instead.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; And what is the true derivation?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; In spite of the mistakes which are made about the power
of this
<br>deity, and the foolish fears which people have of him, such as the
fear of
<br>always being with him after death, and of the soul denuded of the body
<br>going to him (compare Rep.), my belief is that all is quite consistent,
and
<br>that the office and name of the God really correspond.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Why, how is that?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I will tell you my own opinion; but first, I should
like to ask
<br>you which chain does any animal feel to be the stronger? and which
confines
<br>him more to the same spot,--desire or necessity?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Desire, Socrates, is stronger far.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And do you not think that many a one would escape from
Hades, if
<br>he did not bind those who depart to him by the strongest of chains?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Assuredly they would.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And if by the greatest of chains, then by some desire,
as I
<br>should certainly infer, and not by necessity?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is clear.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And there are many desires?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And therefore by the greatest desire, if the chain is
to be the
<br>greatest?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is any desire stronger than the thought that you
will be
<br>made better by associating with another?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly not.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is not that the reason, Hermogenes, why no one,
who has been
<br>to him, is willing to come back to us?&nbsp; Even the Sirens, like
all the rest
<br>of the world, have been laid under his spells.&nbsp; Such a charm,
as I imagine,
<br>is the God able to infuse into his words.&nbsp; And, according to this
view, he
<br>is the perfect and accomplished Sophist, and the great benefactor of
the
<br>inhabitants of the other world; and even to us who are upon earth he
sends
<br>from below exceeding blessings.&nbsp; For he has much more than he
wants down
<br>there; wherefore he is called Pluto (or the rich).&nbsp; Note also,
that he will
<br>have nothing to do with men while they are in the body, but only when
the
<br>soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body.&nbsp; Now
there is a
<br>great deal of philosophy and reflection in that; for in their liberated
<br>state he can bind them with the desire of virtue, but while they are
<br>flustered and maddened by the body, not even father Cronos himself
would
<br>suffice to keep them with him in his own far-famed chains.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There is a deal of truth in what you say.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, Hermogenes, and the legislator called him Hades,
not from
<br>the unseen (aeides)--far otherwise, but from his knowledge (eidenai)
of all
<br>noble things.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very good; and what do we say of Demeter, and Here,
and
<br>Apollo, and Athene, and Hephaestus, and Ares, and the other deities?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Demeter is e didousa meter, who gives food like a mother;
Here
<br>is the lovely one (erate)--for Zeus, according to tradition, loved
and
<br>married her; possibly also the name may have been given when the legislator
<br>was thinking of the heavens, and may be only a disguise of the air
(aer),
<br>putting the end in the place of the beginning.&nbsp; You will recognize
the
<br>truth of this if you repeat the letters of Here several times over.&nbsp;
People
<br>dread the name of Pherephatta as they dread the name of Apollo,--and
with
<br>as little reason; the fear, if I am not mistaken, only arises from
their
<br>ignorance of the nature of names.&nbsp; But they go changing the name
into
<br>Phersephone, and they are terrified at this; whereas the new name means
<br>only that the Goddess is wise (sophe); for seeing that all things in
the
<br>world are in motion (pheromenon), that principle which embraces and
touches
<br>and is able to follow them, is wisdom.&nbsp; And therefore the Goddess
may be
<br>truly called Pherepaphe (Pherepapha), or some name like it, because
she
<br>touches that which is in motion (tou pheromenon ephaptomene), herein
<br>showing her wisdom.&nbsp; And Hades, who is wise, consorts with her,
because she
<br>is wise.&nbsp; They alter her name into Pherephatta now-a-days, because
the
<br>present generation care for euphony more than truth.&nbsp; There is
the other
<br>name, Apollo, which, as I was saying, is generally supposed to have
some
<br>terrible signification.&nbsp; Have you remarked this fact?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; To be sure I have, and what you say is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But the name, in my opinion, is really most expressive
of the
<br>power of the God.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I will endeavour to explain, for I do not believe that
any
<br>single name could have been better adapted to express the attributes
of the
<br>God, embracing and in a manner signifying all four of them,--music,
and
<br>prophecy, and medicine, and archery.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That must be a strange name, and I should like to
hear the
<br>explanation.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Say rather an harmonious name, as beseems the God of
Harmony.
<br>In the first place, the purgations and purifications which doctors
and
<br>diviners use, and their fumigations with drugs magical or medicinal,
as
<br>well as their washings and lustral sprinklings, have all one and the
same
<br>object, which is to make a man pure both in body and soul.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And is not Apollo the purifier, and the washer, and
the absolver
<br>from all impurities?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then in reference to his ablutions and absolutions,
as being the
<br>physician who orders them, he may be rightly called Apolouon (purifier);
or
<br>in respect of his powers of divination, and his truth and sincerity,
which
<br>is the same as truth, he may be most fitly called Aplos, from aplous
<br>(sincere), as in the Thessalian dialect, for all the Thessalians call
him
<br>Aplos; also he is aei Ballon (always shooting), because he is a master
<br>archer who never misses; or again, the name may refer to his musical
<br>attributes, and then, as in akolouthos, and akoitis, and in many other
<br>words the alpha is supposed to mean 'together,' so the meaning of the
name
<br>Apollo will be 'moving together,' whether in the poles of heaven as
they
<br>are called, or in the harmony of song, which is termed concord, because
he
<br>moves all together by an harmonious power, as astronomers and musicians
<br>ingeniously declare.&nbsp; And he is the God who presides over harmony,
and
<br>makes all things move together, both among Gods and among men.&nbsp;
And as in
<br>the words akolouthos and akoitis the alpha is substituted for an omicron,
<br>so the name Apollon is equivalent to omopolon; only the second lambda
is
<br>added in order to avoid the ill-omened sound of destruction (apolon).&nbsp;
Now
<br>the suspicion of this destructive power still haunts the minds of some
who
<br>do not consider the true value of the name, which, as I was saying
just
<br>now, has reference to all the powers of the God, who is the single
one, the
<br>everdarting, the purifier, the mover together (aplous, aei Ballon,
<br>apolouon, omopolon).&nbsp; The name of the Muses and of music would
seem to be
<br>derived from their making philosophical enquiries (mosthai); and Leto
is
<br>called by this name, because she is such a gentle Goddess, and so willing
<br>(ethelemon) to grant our requests; or her name may be Letho, as she
is
<br>often called by strangers--they seem to imply by it her amiability,
and her
<br>smooth and easy-going way of behaving.&nbsp; Artemis is named from
her healthy
<br>(artemes), well-ordered nature, and because of her love of virginity,
<br>perhaps because she is a proficient in virtue (arete), and perhaps
also as
<br>hating intercourse of the sexes (ton aroton misesasa).&nbsp; He who
gave the
<br>Goddess her name may have had any or all of these reasons.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What is the meaning of Dionysus and Aphrodite?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Son of Hipponicus, you ask a solemn question; there
is a serious
<br>and also a facetious explanation of both these names; the serious
<br>explanation is not to be had from me, but there is no objection to
your
<br>hearing the facetious one; for the Gods too love a joke.&nbsp; Dionusos
is
<br>simply didous oinon (giver of wine), Didoinusos, as he might be called
in
<br>fun,--and oinos is properly oionous, because wine makes those who drink,
<br>think (oiesthai) that they have a mind (noun) when they have none.&nbsp;
The
<br>derivation of Aphrodite, born of the foam (aphros), may be fairly accepted
<br>on the authority of Hesiod.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Still there remains Athene, whom you, Socrates, as
an
<br>Athenian, will surely not forget; there are also Hephaestus and Ares.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I am not likely to forget them.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No, indeed.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; There is no difficulty in explaining the other appellation
of
<br>Athene.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What other appellation?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; We call her Pallas.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; To be sure.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And we cannot be wrong in supposing that this is derived
from
<br>armed dances.&nbsp; For the elevation of oneself or anything else above
the
<br>earth, or by the use of the hands, we call shaking (pallein), or dancing.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is quite true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then that is the explanation of the name Pallas?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes; but what do you say of the other name?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Athene?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern
<br>interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of
the
<br>ancients.&nbsp; For most of these in their explanations of the poet,
assert that
<br>he meant by Athene 'mind' (nous) and 'intelligence' (dianoia), and
the
<br>maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and
indeed
<br>calls her by a still higher title, 'divine intelligence' (Thou noesis),
as
<br>though he would say:&nbsp; This is she who has the mind of God (Theonoa);--using
<br>alpha as a dialectical variety for eta, and taking away iota and sigma
<br>(There seems to be some error in the MSS.&nbsp; The meaning is that
the word
<br>theonoa = theounoa is a curtailed form of theou noesis, but the omitted
<br>letters do not agree.).&nbsp; Perhaps, however, the name Theonoe may
mean 'she
<br>who knows divine things' (Theia noousa) better than others.&nbsp; Nor
shall we
<br>be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify
this
<br>Goddess with moral intelligence (en ethei noesin), and therefore gave
her
<br>the name ethonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have
altered
<br>into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athene.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But what do you say of Hephaestus?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Speak you of the princely lord of light (Phaeos istora)?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Surely.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Ephaistos is Phaistos, and has added the eta by attraction;
that
<br>is obvious to anybody.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is very probable, until some more probable notion
gets
<br>into your head.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; To prevent that, you had better ask what is the derivation
of
<br>Ares.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What is Ares?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Ares may be called, if you will, from his manhood (arren)
and
<br>manliness, or if you please, from his hard and unchangeable nature,
which
<br>is the meaning of arratos:&nbsp; the latter is a derivation in every
way
<br>appropriate to the God of war.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And now, by the Gods, let us have no more of the Gods,
for I am
<br>afraid of them; ask about anything but them, and thou shalt see how
the
<br>steeds of Euthyphro can prance.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Only one more God!&nbsp; I should like to know about
Hermes, of
<br>whom I am said not to be a true son.&nbsp; Let us make him out, and
then I shall
<br>know whether there is any meaning in what Cratylus says.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I should imagine that the name Hermes has to do with
speech, and
<br>signifies that he is the interpreter (ermeneus), or messenger, or thief,
or
<br>liar, or bargainer; all that sort of thing has a great deal to do with
<br>language; as I was telling you, the word eirein is expressive of the
use of
<br>speech, and there is an often-recurring Homeric word emesato, which
means
<br>'he contrived'--out of these two words, eirein and mesasthai, the
<br>legislator formed the name of the God who invented language and speech;
and
<br>we may imagine him dictating to us the use of this name:&nbsp; 'O my
friends,'
<br>says he to us, 'seeing that he is the contriver of tales or speeches,
you
<br>may rightly call him Eirhemes.'&nbsp; And this has been improved by
us, as we
<br>think, into Hermes.&nbsp; Iris also appears to have been called from
the verb
<br>'to tell' (eirein), because she was a messenger.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Then I am very sure that Cratylus was quite right
in saying
<br>that I was no true son of Hermes (Ermogenes), for I am not a good hand
at
<br>speeches.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; There is also reason, my friend, in Pan being the double-formed
<br>son of Hermes.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How do you make that out?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You are aware that speech signifies all things (pan),
and is
<br>always turning them round and round, and has two forms, true and false?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Is not the truth that is in him the smooth or sacred
form which
<br>dwells above among the Gods, whereas falsehood dwells among men below,
and
<br>is rough like the goat of tragedy; for tales and falsehoods have generally
<br>to do with the tragic or goatish life, and tragedy is the place of
them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then surely Pan, who is the declarer of all things (pan)
and the
<br>perpetual mover (aei polon) of all things, is rightly called aipolos
(goat-
<br>herd), he being the two-formed son of Hermes, smooth in his upper part,
and
<br>rough and goatlike in his lower regions.&nbsp; And, as the son of Hermes,
he is
<br>speech or the brother of speech, and that brother should be like brother
is
<br>no marvel.&nbsp; But, as I was saying, my dear Hermogenes, let us get
away from
<br>the Gods.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; From these sort of Gods, by all means, Socrates.&nbsp;
But why
<br>should we not discuss another kind of Gods--the sun, moon, stars, earth,
<br>aether, air, fire, water, the seasons, and the year?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You impose a great many tasks upon me.&nbsp; Still,
if you wish, I
<br>will not refuse.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; You will oblige me.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; How would you have me begin?&nbsp; Shall I take first
of all him whom
<br>you mentioned first--the sun?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very good.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The origin of the sun will probably be clearer in the
Doric
<br>form, for the Dorians call him alios, and this name is given to him
because
<br>when he rises he gathers (alizoi) men together or because he is always
<br>rolling in his course (aei eilein ion) about the earth; or from aiolein,
of
<br>which the meaning is the same as poikillein (to variegate), because
he
<br>variegates the productions of the earth.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But what is selene (the moon)?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That name is rather unfortunate for Anaxagoras.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The word seems to forestall his recent discovery, that
the moon
<br>receives her light from the sun.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Why do you say so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The two words selas (brightness) and phos (light) have
much the
<br>same meaning?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; This light about the moon is always new (neon) and always
old
<br>(enon), if the disciples of Anaxagoras say truly.&nbsp; For the sun
in his
<br>revolution always adds new light, and there is the old light of the
<br>previous month.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The moon is not unfrequently called selanaia.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And as she has a light which is always old and always
new (enon
<br>neon aei) she may very properly have the name selaenoneoaeia; and this
when
<br>hammered into shape becomes selanaia.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; A real dithyrambic sort of name that, Socrates.&nbsp;
But what do
<br>you say of the month and the stars?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Meis (month) is called from meiousthai (to lessen),
because
<br>suffering diminution; the name of astra (stars) seems to be derived
from
<br>astrape, which is an improvement on anastrope, signifying the upsetting
of
<br>the eyes (anastrephein opa).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you say of pur (fire) and udor (water)?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I am at a loss how to explain pur; either the muse of
Euthyphro
<br>has deserted me, or there is some very great difficulty in the word.
<br>Please, however, to note the contrivance which I adopt whenever I am
in a
<br>difficulty of this sort.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What is it?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I will tell you; but I should like to know first whether
you can
<br>tell me what is the meaning of the pur?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Indeed I cannot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Shall I tell you what I suspect to be the true explanation
of
<br>this and several other words?--My belief is that they are of foreign
<br>origin.&nbsp; For the Hellenes, especially those who were under the
dominion of
<br>the barbarians, often borrowed from them.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What is the inference?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Why, you know that any one who seeks to demonstrate
the fitness
<br>of these names according to the Hellenic language, and not according
to the
<br>language from which the words are derived, is rather likely to be at
fault.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well then, consider whether this pur is not foreign;
for the
<br>word is not easily brought into relation with the Hellenic tongue,
and the
<br>Phrygians may be observed to have the same word slightly changed, just
as
<br>they have udor (water) and kunes (dogs), and many other words.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Any violent interpretations of the words should be avoided;
for
<br>something to say about them may easily be found.&nbsp; And thus I get
rid of pur
<br>and udor.&nbsp; Aer (air), Hermogenes, may be explained as the element
which
<br>raises (airei) things from the earth, or as ever flowing (aei rei),
or
<br>because the flux of the air is wind, and the poets call the winds 'air-
<br>blasts,' (aetai); he who uses the term may mean, so to speak, air-flux
<br>(aetorroun), in the sense of wind-flux (pneumatorroun); and because
this
<br>moving wind may be expressed by either term he employs the word air
(aer =
<br>aetes rheo).&nbsp; Aither (aether) I should interpret as aeitheer;
this may be
<br>correctly said, because this element is always running in a flux about
the
<br>air (aei thei peri tou aera reon).&nbsp; The meaning of the word ge
(earth)
<br>comes out better when in the form of gaia, for the earth may be truly
<br>called 'mother' (gaia, genneteira), as in the language of Homer (Od.)
<br>gegaasi means gegennesthai.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Good.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What shall we take next?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There are orai (the seasons), and the two names of
the year,
<br>eniautos and etos.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The orai should be spelt in the old Attic way, if you
desire to
<br>know the probable truth about them; they are rightly called the orai
<br>because they divide (orizousin) the summers and winters and winds and
the
<br>fruits of the earth.&nbsp; The words eniautos and etos appear to be
the same,--
<br>'that which brings to light the plants and growths of the earth in
their
<br>turn, and passes them in review within itself (en eauto exetazei)':&nbsp;
this
<br>is broken up into two words, eniautos from en eauto, and etos from
etazei,
<br>just as the original name of Zeus was divided into Zena and Dia; and
the
<br>whole proposition means that his power of reviewing from within is
one, but
<br>has two names, two words etos and eniautos being thus formed out of
a
<br>single proposition.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Indeed, Socrates, you make surprising progress.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I am run away with.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But am not yet at my utmost speed.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should like very much to know, in the next place,
how you
<br>would explain the virtues.&nbsp; What principle of correctness is there
in those
<br>charming words--wisdom, understanding, justice, and the rest of them?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is a tremendous class of names which you are disinterring;
<br>still, as I have put on the lion's skin, I must not be faint of heart;
and
<br>I suppose that I must consider the meaning of wisdom (phronesis) and
<br>understanding (sunesis), and judgment (gnome), and knowledge (episteme),
<br>and all those other charming words, as you call them?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Surely, we must not leave off until we find out their
meaning.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; By the dog of Egypt I have a not bad notion which came
into my
<br>head only this moment:&nbsp; I believe that the primeval givers of
names were
<br>undoubtedly like too many of our modern philosophers, who, in their
search
<br>after the nature of things, are always getting dizzy from constantly
going
<br>round and round, and then they imagine that the world is going round
and
<br>round and moving in all directions; and this appearance, which arises
out
<br>of their own internal condition, they suppose to be a reality of nature;
<br>they think that there is nothing stable or permanent, but only flux
and
<br>motion, and that the world is always full of every sort of motion and
<br>change.&nbsp; The consideration of the names which I mentioned has
led me into
<br>making this reflection.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How is that, Socrates?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Perhaps you did not observe that in the names which
have been
<br>just cited, the motion or flux or generation of things is most surely
<br>indicated.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No, indeed, I never thought of it.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Take the first of those which you mentioned; clearly
that is a
<br>name indicative of motion.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What was the name?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Phronesis (wisdom), which may signify phoras kai rhou
noesis
<br>(perception of motion and flux), or perhaps phoras onesis (the blessing
of
<br>motion), but is at any rate connected with pheresthai (motion); gnome
<br>(judgment), again, certainly implies the ponderation or consideration
<br>(nomesis) of generation, for to ponder is the same as to consider;
or, if
<br>you would rather, here is noesis, the very word just now mentioned,
which
<br>is neou esis (the desire of the new); the word neos implies that the
world
<br>is always in process of creation.&nbsp; The giver of the name wanted
to express
<br>this longing of the soul, for the original name was neoesis, and not
<br>noesis; but eta took the place of a double epsilon.&nbsp; The word
sophrosune is
<br>the salvation (soteria) of that wisdom (phronesis) which we were just
now
<br>considering.&nbsp; Epioteme (knowledge) is akin to this, and indicates
that the
<br>soul which is good for anything follows (epetai) the motion of things,
<br>neither anticipating them nor falling behind them; wherefore the word
<br>should rather be read as epistemene, inserting epsilon nu.&nbsp; Sunesis
<br>(understanding) may be regarded in like manner as a kind of conclusion;
the
<br>word is derived from sunienai (to go along with), and, like epistasthai
(to
<br>know), implies the progression of the soul in company with the nature
of
<br>things.&nbsp; Sophia (wisdom) is very dark, and appears not to be of
native
<br>growth; the meaning is, touching the motion or stream of things.&nbsp;
You must
<br>remember that the poets, when they speak of the commencement of any
rapid
<br>motion, often use the word esuthe (he rushed); and there was a famous
<br>Lacedaemonian who was named Sous (Rush), for by this word the
<br>Lacedaemonians signify rapid motion, and the touching (epaphe) of motion
is
<br>expressed by sophia, for all things are supposed to be in motion.&nbsp;
Good
<br>(agathon) is the name which is given to the admirable (agasto) in nature;
<br>for, although all things move, still there are degrees of motion; some
are
<br>swifter, some slower; but there are some things which are admirable
for
<br>their swiftness, and this admirable part of nature is called agathon.
<br>Dikaiosune (justice) is clearly dikaiou sunesis (understanding of the
<br>just); but the actual word dikaion is more difficult:&nbsp; men are
only agreed
<br>to a certain extent about justice, and then they begin to disagree.&nbsp;
For
<br>those who suppose all things to be in motion conceive the greater part
of
<br>nature to be a mere receptacle; and they say that there is a penetrating
<br>power which passes through all this, and is the instrument of creation
in
<br>all, and is the subtlest and swiftest element; for if it were not the
<br>subtlest, and a power which none can keep out, and also the swiftest,
<br>passing by other things as if they were standing still, it could not
<br>penetrate through the moving universe.&nbsp; And this element, which
<br>superintends all things and pierces (diaion) all, is rightly called
<br>dikaion; the letter k is only added for the sake of euphony.&nbsp;
Thus far, as
<br>I was saying, there is a general agreement about the nature of justice;
but
<br>I, Hermogenes, being an enthusiastic disciple, have been told in a
mystery
<br>that the justice of which I am speaking is also the cause of the world:
<br>now a cause is that because of which anything is created; and some
one
<br>comes and whispers in my ear that justice is rightly so called because
<br>partaking of the nature of the cause, and I begin, after hearing what
he
<br>has said, to interrogate him gently:&nbsp; 'Well, my excellent friend,'
say I,
<br>'but if all this be true, I still want to know what is justice.'&nbsp;
Thereupon
<br>they think that I ask tiresome questions, and am leaping over the barriers,
<br>and have been already sufficiently answered, and they try to satisfy
me
<br>with one derivation after another, and at length they quarrel.&nbsp;
For one of
<br>them says that justice is the sun, and that he only is the piercing
<br>(diaionta) and burning (kaonta) element which is the guardian of nature.
<br>And when I joyfully repeat this beautiful notion, I am answered by
the
<br>satirical remark, 'What, is there no justice in the world when the
sun is
<br>down?'&nbsp; And when I earnestly beg my questioner to tell me his
own honest
<br>opinion, he says, 'Fire in the abstract'; but this is not very
<br>intelligible.&nbsp; Another says, 'No, not fire in the abstract, but
the
<br>abstraction of heat in the fire.'&nbsp; Another man professes to laugh
at all
<br>this, and says, as Anaxagoras says, that justice is mind, for mind,
as they
<br>say, has absolute power, and mixes with nothing, and orders all things,
and
<br>passes through all things.&nbsp; At last, my friend, I find myself
in far
<br>greater perplexity about the nature of justice than I was before I
began to
<br>learn.&nbsp; But still I am of opinion that the name, which has led
me into this
<br>digression, was given to justice for the reasons which I have mentioned.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think, Socrates, that you are not improvising now;
you must
<br>have heard this from some one else.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And not the rest?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Hardly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, then, let me go on in the hope of making you believe
in
<br>the originality of the rest.&nbsp; What remains after justice?&nbsp;
I do not think
<br>that we have as yet discussed courage (andreia),--injustice (adikia),
which
<br>is obviously nothing more than a hindrance to the penetrating principle
<br>(diaiontos), need not be considered.&nbsp; Well, then, the name of
andreia seems
<br>to imply a battle;--this battle is in the world of existence, and according
<br>to the doctrine of flux is only the counterflux (enantia rhon):&nbsp;
if you
<br>extract the delta from andreia, the name at once signifies the thing,
and
<br>you may clearly understand that andreia is not the stream opposed to
every
<br>stream, but only to that which is contrary to justice, for otherwise
<br>courage would not have been praised.&nbsp; The words arren (male) and
aner (man)
<br>also contain a similar allusion to the same principle of the upward
flux
<br>(te ano rhon).&nbsp; Gune (woman) I suspect to be the same word as
goun (birth):
<br>thelu (female) appears to be partly derived from thele (the teat),
because
<br>the teat is like rain, and makes things flourish (tethelenai).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is surely probable.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes; and the very word thallein (to flourish) seems
to figure
<br>the growth of youth, which is swift and sudden ever.&nbsp; And this
is expressed
<br>by the legislator in the name, which is a compound of thein (running),
and
<br>allesthai (leaping).&nbsp; Pray observe how I gallop away when I get
on smooth
<br>ground.&nbsp; There are a good many names generally thought to be of
importance,
<br>which have still to be explained.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; There is the meaning of the word techne (art), for example.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That may be identified with echonoe, and expresses the
<br>possession of mind:&nbsp; you have only to take away the tau and insert
two
<br>omichrons, one between the chi and nu, and another between the nu and
eta.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is a very shabby etymology.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, my dear friend; but then you know that the original
names
<br>have been long ago buried and disguised by people sticking on and stripping
<br>off letters for the sake of euphony, and twisting and bedizening them
in
<br>all sorts of ways:&nbsp; and time too may have had a share in the change.&nbsp;
Take,
<br>for example, the word katoptron; why is the letter rho inserted?&nbsp;
This must
<br>surely be the addition of some one who cares nothing about the truth,
but
<br>thinks only of putting the mouth into shape.&nbsp; And the additions
are often
<br>such that at last no human being can possibly make out the original
meaning
<br>of the word.&nbsp; Another example is the word sphigx, sphiggos, which
ought
<br>properly to be phigx, phiggos, and there are other examples.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is quite true, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And yet, if you are permitted to put in and pull out
any letters
<br>which you please, names will be too easily made, and any name may be
<br>adapted to any object.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, that is true.&nbsp; And therefore a wise dictator,
like
<br>yourself, should observe the laws of moderation and probability.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Such is my desire.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And mine, too, Hermogenes.&nbsp; But do not be too much
of a
<br>precisian, or 'you will unnerve me of my strength (Iliad.).'&nbsp;
When you have
<br>allowed me to add mechane (contrivance) to techne (art) I shall be
at the
<br>top of my bent, for I conceive mechane to be a sign of great accomplishment
<br>--anein; for mekos has the meaning of greatness, and these two, mekos
and
<br>anein, make up the word mechane.&nbsp; But, as I was saying, being
now at the
<br>top of my bent, I should like to consider the meaning of the two words
<br>arete (virtue) and kakia (vice); arete I do not as yet understand,
but
<br>kakia is transparent, and agrees with the principles which preceded,
for
<br>all things being in a flux (ionton), kakia is kakos ion (going badly);
and
<br>this evil motion when existing in the soul has the general name of
kakia,
<br>or vice, specially appropriated to it.&nbsp; The meaning of kakos ienai
may be
<br>further illustrated by the use of deilia (cowardice), which ought to
have
<br>come after andreia, but was forgotten, and, as I fear, is not the only
word
<br>which has been passed over.&nbsp; Deilia signifies that the soul is
bound with a
<br>strong chain (desmos), for lian means strength, and therefore deilia
<br>expresses the greatest and strongest bond of the soul; and aporia
<br>(difficulty) is an evil of the same nature (from a (alpha) not, and
<br>poreuesthai to go), like anything else which is an impediment to motion
and
<br>movement.&nbsp; Then the word kakia appears to mean kakos ienai, or
going badly,
<br>or limping and halting; of which the consequence is, that the soul
becomes
<br>filled with vice.&nbsp; And if kakia is the name of this sort of thing,
arete
<br>will be the opposite of it, signifying in the first place ease of motion,
<br>then that the stream of the good soul is unimpeded, and has therefore
the
<br>attribute of ever flowing without let or hindrance, and is therefore
called
<br>arete, or, more correctly, aeireite (ever-flowing), and may perhaps
have
<br>had another form, airete (eligible), indicating that nothing is more
<br>eligible than virtue, and this has been hammered into arete.&nbsp;
I daresay
<br>that you will deem this to be another invention of mine, but I think
that
<br>if the previous word kakia was right, then arete is also right.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But what is the meaning of kakon, which has played
so great a
<br>part in your previous discourse?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is a very singular word about which I can hardly
form an
<br>opinion, and therefore I must have recourse to my ingenious device.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What device?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The device of a foreign origin, which I shall give to
this word
<br>also.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very likely you are right; but suppose that we leave
these
<br>words and endeavour to see the rationale of kalon and aischron.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The meaning of aischron is evident, being only aei ischon
roes
<br>(always preventing from flowing), and this is in accordance with our
former
<br>derivations.&nbsp; For the name-giver was a great enemy to stagnation
of all
<br>sorts, and hence he gave the name aeischoroun to that which hindered
the
<br>flux (aei ischon roun), and that is now beaten together into aischron.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But what do you say of kalon?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is more obscure; yet the form is only due to the
quantity,
<br>and has been changed by altering omicron upsilon into omicron.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; This name appears to denote mind.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Let me ask you what is the cause why anything has a
name; is not
<br>the principle which imposes the name the cause?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And must not this be the mind of Gods, or of men, or
of both?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Is not mind that which called (kalesan) things by their
names,
<br>and is not mind the beautiful (kalon)?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is evident.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And are not the works of intelligence and mind worthy
of praise,
<br>and are not other works worthy of blame?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Physic does the work of a physician, and carpentering
does the
<br>works of a carpenter?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Exactly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the principle of beauty does the works of beauty?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Of course.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And that principle we affirm to be mind?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then mind is rightly called beauty because she does
the works
<br>which we recognize and speak of as the beautiful?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is evident.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What more names remain to us?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There are the words which are connected with agathon
and
<br>kalon, such as sumpheron and lusiteloun, ophelimon, kerdaleon, and
their
<br>opposites.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The meaning of sumpheron (expedient) I think that you
may
<br>discover for yourself by the light of the previous examples,--for it
is a
<br>sister word to episteme, meaning just the motion (pora) of the soul
<br>accompanying the world, and things which are done upon this principle
are
<br>called sumphora or sumpheronta, because they are carried round with
the
<br>world.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is probable.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Again, cherdaleon (gainful) is called from cherdos (gain),
but
<br>you must alter the delta into nu if you want to get at the meaning;
for
<br>this word also signifies good, but in another way; he who gave the
name
<br>intended to express the power of admixture (kerannumenon) and universal
<br>penetration in the good; in forming the word, however, he inserted
a delta
<br>instead of a nu, and so made kerdos.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Well, but what is lusiteloun (profitable)?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I suppose, Hermogenes, that people do not mean by the
profitable
<br>the gainful or that which pays (luei) the retailer, but they use the
word
<br>in the sense of swift.&nbsp; You regard the profitable (lusiteloun),
as that
<br>which being the swiftest thing in existence, allows of no stay in things
<br>and no pause or end of motion, but always, if there begins to be any
end,
<br>lets things go again (luei), and makes motion immortal and unceasing:&nbsp;
and
<br>in this point of view, as appears to me, the good is happily denominated
<br>lusiteloun--being that which looses (luon) the end (telos) of motion.
<br>Ophelimon (the advantageous) is derived from ophellein, meaning that
which
<br>creates and increases; this latter is a common Homeric word, and has
a
<br>foreign character.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; And what do you say of their opposites?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Of such as are mere negatives I hardly think that I
need speak.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Which are they?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The words axumphoron (inexpedient), anopheles (unprofitable),
<br>alusiteles (unadvantageous), akerdes (ungainful).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I would rather take the words blaberon (harmful), zemiodes
<br>(hurtful).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Good.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The word blaberon is that which is said to hinder or
harm
<br>(blaptein) the stream (roun); blapton is boulomenon aptein (seeking
to hold
<br>or bind); for aptein is the same as dein, and dein is always a term
of
<br>censure; boulomenon aptein roun (wanting to bind the stream) would
properly
<br>be boulapteroun, and this, as I imagine, is improved into blaberon.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; You bring out curious results, Socrates, in the use
of names;
<br>and when I hear the word boulapteroun I cannot help imagining that
you are
<br>making your mouth into a flute, and puffing away at some prelude to
Athene.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is the fault of the makers of the name, Hermogenes;
not
<br>mine.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true; but what is the derivation of zemiodes?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What is the meaning of zemiodes?--let me remark, Hermogenes,
how
<br>right I was in saying that great changes are made in the meaning of
words
<br>by putting in and pulling out letters; even a very slight permutation
will
<br>sometimes give an entirely opposite sense; I may instance the word
deon,
<br>which occurs to me at the moment, and reminds me of what I was going
to say
<br>to you, that the fine fashionable language of modern times has twisted
and
<br>disguised and entirely altered the original meaning both of deon, and
also
<br>of zemiodes, which in the old language is clearly indicated.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I will try to explain.&nbsp; You are aware that our
forefathers loved
<br>the sounds iota and delta, especially the women, who are most conservative
<br>of the ancient language, but now they change iota into eta or epsilon,
and
<br>delta into zeta; this is supposed to increase the grandeur of the sound.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; How do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; For example, in very ancient times they called the day
either
<br>imera or emera (short e), which is called by us emera (long e).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Do you observe that only the ancient form shows the
intention of
<br>the giver of the name? of which the reason is, that men long for
<br>(imeirousi) and love the light which comes after the darkness, and
is
<br>therefore called imera, from imeros, desire.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Clearly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But now the name is so travestied that you cannot tell
the
<br>meaning, although there are some who imagine the day to be called emera
<br>because it makes things gentle (emera different accents).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Such is my view.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And do you know that the ancients said duogon and not
zugon?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; They did so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And zugon (yoke) has no meaning,--it ought to be duogon,
which
<br>word expresses the binding of two together (duein agoge) for the purpose
of
<br>drawing;--this has been changed into zugon, and there are many other
<br>examples of similar changes.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There are.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Proceeding in the same train of thought I may remark
that the
<br>word deon (obligation) has a meaning which is the opposite of all the
other
<br>appellations of good; for deon is here a species of good, and is,
<br>nevertheless, the chain (desmos) or hinderer of motion, and therefore
own
<br>brother of blaberon.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes, Socrates; that is quite plain.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Not if you restore the ancient form, which is more likely
to be
<br>the correct one, and read dion instead of deon; if you convert the
epsilon
<br>into an iota after the old fashion, this word will then agree with
other
<br>words meaning good; for dion, not deon, signifies the good, and is
a term
<br>of praise; and the author of names has not contradicted himself, but
in all
<br>these various appellations, deon (obligatory), ophelimon (advantageous),
<br>lusiteloun (profitable), kerdaleon (gainful), agathon (good), sumpheron
<br>(expedient), euporon (plenteous), the same conception is implied of
the
<br>ordering or all-pervading principle which is praised, and the restraining
<br>and binding principle which is censured.&nbsp; And this is further
illustrated
<br>by the word zemiodes (hurtful), which if the zeta is only changed into
<br>delta as in the ancient language, becomes demiodes; and this name,
as you
<br>will perceive, is given to that which binds motion (dounti ion).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you say of edone (pleasure), lupe (pain),
epithumia
<br>(desire), and the like, Socrates?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I do not think, Hermogenes, that there is any great
difficulty
<br>about them--edone is e (eta) onesis, the action which tends to advantage;
<br>and the original form may be supposed to have been eone, but this has
been
<br>altered by the insertion of the delta.&nbsp; Lupe appears to be derived
from the
<br>relaxation (luein) which the body feels when in sorrow; ania (trouble)
is
<br>the hindrance of motion (alpha and ienai); algedon (distress), if I
am not
<br>mistaken, is a foreign word, which is derived from aleinos (grievous);
<br>odune (grief) is called from the putting on (endusis) sorrow; in achthedon
<br>(vexation) 'the word too labours,' as any one may see; chara (joy)
is the
<br>very expression of the fluency and diffusion of the soul (cheo); terpsis
<br>(delight) is so called from the pleasure creeping (erpon) through the
soul,
<br>which may be likened to a breath (pnoe) and is properly erpnoun, but
has
<br>been altered by time into terpnon; eupherosune (cheerfulness) and epithumia
<br>explain themselves; the former, which ought to be eupherosune and has
been
<br>changed euphrosune, is named, as every one may see, from the soul moving
<br>(pheresthai) in harmony with nature; epithumia is really e epi ton
thumon
<br>iousa dunamis, the power which enters into the soul; thumos (passion)
is
<br>called from the rushing (thuseos) and boiling of the soul; imeros (desire)
<br>denotes the stream (rous) which most draws the soul dia ten esin tes
roes--
<br>because flowing with desire (iemenos), and expresses a longing after
things
<br>and violent attraction of the soul to them, and is termed imeros from
<br>possessing this power; pothos (longing) is expressive of the desire
of that
<br>which is not present but absent, and in another place (pou); this is
the
<br>reason why the name pothos is applied to things absent, as imeros is
to
<br>things present; eros (love) is so called because flowing in (esron)
from
<br>without; the stream is not inherent, but is an influence introduced
through
<br>the eyes, and from flowing in was called esros (influx) in the old
time
<br>when they used omicron for omega, and is called eros, now that omega
is
<br>substituted for omicron.&nbsp; But why do you not give me another word?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What do you think of doxa (opinion), and that class
of words?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Doxa is either derived from dioxis (pursuit), and expresses
the
<br>march of the soul in the pursuit of knowledge, or from the shooting
of a
<br>bow (toxon); the latter is more likely, and is confirmed by oiesis
<br>(thinking), which is only oisis (moving), and implies the movement
of the
<br>soul to the essential nature of each thing--just as boule (counsel)
has to
<br>do with shooting (bole); and boulesthai (to wish) combines the notion
of
<br>aiming and deliberating--all these words seem to follow doxa, and all
<br>involve the idea of shooting, just as aboulia, absence of counsel,
on the
<br>other hand, is a mishap, or missing, or mistaking of the mark, or aim,
or
<br>proposal, or object.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; You are quickening your pace now, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Why yes, the end I now dedicate to God, not, however,
until I
<br>have explained anagke (necessity), which ought to come next, and ekousion
<br>(the voluntary).&nbsp; Ekousion is certainly the yielding (eikon) and
<br>unresisting--the notion implied is yielding and not opposing, yielding,
as
<br>I was just now saying, to that motion which is in accordance with our
will;
<br>but the necessary and resistant being contrary to our will, implies
error
<br>and ignorance; the idea is taken from walking through a ravine which
is
<br>impassable, and rugged, and overgrown, and impedes motion--and this
is the
<br>derivation of the word anagkaion (necessary) an agke ion, going through
a
<br>ravine.&nbsp; But while my strength lasts let us persevere, and I hope
that you
<br>will persevere with your questions.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Well, then, let me ask about the greatest and noblest,
such as
<br>aletheia (truth) and pseudos (falsehood) and on (being), not forgetting
to
<br>enquire why the word onoma (name), which is the theme of our discussion,
<br>has this name of onoma.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You know the word maiesthai (to seek)?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes;--meaning the same as zetein (to enquire).
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The word onoma seems to be a compressed sentence, signifying
on
<br>ou zetema (being for which there is a search); as is still more obvious
in
<br>onomaston (notable), which states in so many words that real existence
is
<br>that for which there is a seeking (on ou masma); aletheia is also an
<br>agglomeration of theia ale (divine wandering), implying the divine
motion
<br>of existence; pseudos (falsehood) is the opposite of motion; here is
<br>another ill name given by the legislator to stagnation and forced inaction,
<br>which he compares to sleep (eudein); but the original meaning of the
word
<br>is disguised by the addition of psi; on and ousia are ion with an iota
<br>broken off; this agrees with the true principle, for being (on) is
also
<br>moving (ion), and the same may be said of not being, which is likewise
<br>called not going (oukion or ouki on = ouk ion).
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; You have hammered away at them manfully; but suppose
that some
<br>one were to say to you, what is the word ion, and what are reon and
doun?--
<br>show me their fitness.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; You mean to say, how should I answer him?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; One way of giving the appearance of an answer has been
already
<br>suggested.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; What way?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; To say that names which we do not understand are of
foreign
<br>origin; and this is very likely the right answer, and something of
this
<br>kind may be true of them; but also the original forms of words may
have
<br>been lost in the lapse of ages; names have been so twisted in all manner
of
<br>ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared
with
<br>that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very likely.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Yes, very likely.&nbsp; But still the enquiry demands
our earnest
<br>attention and we must not flinch.&nbsp; For we should remember, that
if a person
<br>go on analysing names into words, and enquiring also into the elements
out
<br>of which the words are formed, and keeps on always repeating this process,
<br>he who has to answer him must at last give up the enquiry in despair.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And at what point ought he to lose heart and give up
the
<br>enquiry?&nbsp; Must he not stop when he comes to the names which are
the
<br>elements of all other names and sentences; for these cannot be supposed
to
<br>be made up of other names?&nbsp; The word agathon (good), for example,
is, as we
<br>were saying, a compound of agastos (admirable) and thoos (swift).&nbsp;
And
<br>probably thoos is made up of other elements, and these again of others.
<br>But if we take a word which is incapable of further resolution, then
we
<br>shall be right in saying that we have at last reached a primary element,
<br>which need not be resolved any further.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I believe you to be in the right.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And suppose the names about which you are now asking
should turn
<br>out to be primary elements, must not their truth or law be examined
<br>according to some new method?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very likely.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Quite so, Hermogenes; all that has preceded would lead
to this
<br>conclusion.&nbsp; And if, as I think, the conclusion is true, then
I shall again
<br>say to you, come and help me, that I may not fall into some absurdity
in
<br>stating the principle of primary names.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Let me hear, and I will do my best to assist you.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I think that you will acknowledge with me, that one
principle is
<br>applicable to all names, primary as well as secondary--when they are
<br>regarded simply as names, there is no difference in them.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly not.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; All the names that we have been explaining were intended
to
<br>indicate the nature of things.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Of course.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And that this is true of the primary quite as much as
of the
<br>secondary names, is implied in their being names.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Surely.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But the secondary, as I conceive, derive their significance
from
<br>the primary.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That is evident.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Very good; but then how do the primary names which precede
<br>analysis show the natures of things, as far as they can be shown; which
<br>they must do, if they are to be real names?&nbsp; And here I will ask
you a
<br>question:&nbsp; Suppose that we had no voice or tongue, and wanted
to
<br>communicate with one another, should we not, like the deaf and dumb,
make
<br>signs with the hands and head and the rest of the body?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There would be no choice, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; We should imitate the nature of the thing; the elevation
of our
<br>hands to heaven would mean lightness and upwardness; heaviness and
<br>downwardness would be expressed by letting them drop to the ground;
if we
<br>were describing the running of a horse, or any other animal, we should
make
<br>our bodies and their gestures as like as we could to them.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I do not see that we could do anything else.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; We could not; for by bodily imitation only can the body
ever
<br>express anything.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And when we want to express ourselves, either with the
voice, or
<br>tongue, or mouth, the expression is simply their imitation of that
which we
<br>want to express.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; It must be so, I think.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then a name is a vocal imitation of that which the vocal
<br>imitator names or imitates?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I think so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Nay, my friend, I am disposed to think that we have
not reached
<br>the truth as yet.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Why not?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Because if we have we shall be obliged to admit that
the people
<br>who imitate sheep, or cocks, or other animals, name that which they
<br>imitate.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Quite true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then could I have been right in what I was saying?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; In my opinion, no.&nbsp; But I wish that you would
tell me,
<br>Socrates, what sort of an imitation is a name?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; In the first place, I should reply, not a musical imitation,
<br>although that is also vocal; nor, again, an imitation of what music
<br>imitates; these, in my judgment, would not be naming.&nbsp; Let me
put the
<br>matter as follows:&nbsp; All objects have sound and figure, and many
have
<br>colour?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But the art of naming appears not to be concerned with
<br>imitations of this kind; the arts which have to do with them are music
and
<br>drawing?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Again, is there not an essence of each thing, just as
there is a
<br>colour, or sound?&nbsp; And is there not an essence of colour and sound
as well
<br>as of anything else which may be said to have an essence?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I should think so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, and if any one could express the essence of each
thing in
<br>letters and syllables, would he not express the nature of each thing?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Quite so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The musician and the painter were the two names which
you gave
<br>to the two other imitators.&nbsp; What will this imitator be called?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I imagine, Socrates, that he must be the namer, or
name-giver,
<br>of whom we are in search.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; If this is true, then I think that we are in a condition
to
<br>consider the names ron (stream), ienai (to go), schesis (retention),
about
<br>which you were asking; and we may see whether the namer has grasped
the
<br>nature of them in letters and syllables in such a manner as to imitate
the
<br>essence or not.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Very good.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But are these the only primary names, or are there others?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; There must be others.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; So I should expect.&nbsp; But how shall we further analyse
them, and
<br>where does the imitator begin?&nbsp; Imitation of the essence is made
by
<br>syllables and letters; ought we not, therefore, first to separate the
<br>letters, just as those who are beginning rhythm first distinguish the
<br>powers of elementary, and then of compound sounds, and when they have
done
<br>so, but not before, they proceed to the consideration of rhythms?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Must we not begin in the same way with letters; first
separating
<br>the vowels, and then the consonants and mutes (letters which are neither
<br>vowels nor semivowels), into classes, according to the received
<br>distinctions of the learned; also the semivowels, which are neither
vowels,
<br>nor yet mutes; and distinguishing into classes the vowels themselves?&nbsp;
And
<br>when we have perfected the classification of things, we shall give
them
<br>names, and see whether, as in the case of letters, there are any classes
to
<br>which they may be all referred (cf. Phaedrus); and hence we shall see
their
<br>natures, and see, too, whether they have in them classes as there are
in
<br>the letters; and when we have well considered all this, we shall know
how
<br>to apply them to what they resemble--whether one letter is used to
denote
<br>one thing, or whether there is to be an admixture of several of them;
just,
<br>as in painting, the painter who wants to depict anything sometimes
uses
<br>purple only, or any other colour, and sometimes mixes up several colours,
<br>as his method is when he has to paint flesh colour or anything of that
<br>kind--he uses his colours as his figures appear to require them; and
so,
<br>too, we shall apply letters to the expression of objects, either single
<br>letters when required, or several letters; and so we shall form syllables,
<br>as they are called, and from syllables make nouns and verbs; and thus,
at
<br>last, from the combinations of nouns and verbs arrive at language,
large
<br>and fair and whole; and as the painter made a figure, even so shall
we make
<br>speech by the art of the namer or the rhetorician, or by some other
art.
<br>Not that I am literally speaking of ourselves, but I was carried away--
<br>meaning to say that this was the way in which (not we but) the ancients
<br>formed language, and what they put together we must take to pieces
in like
<br>manner, if we are to attain a scientific view of the whole subject,
and we
<br>must see whether the primary, and also whether the secondary elements
are
<br>rightly given or not, for if they are not, the composition of them,
my dear
<br>Hermogenes, will be a sorry piece of work, and in the wrong direction.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; That, Socrates, I can quite believe.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, but do you suppose that you will be able to analyse
them
<br>in this way? for I am certain that I should not.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Much less am I likely to be able.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Shall we leave them, then? or shall we seek to discover,
if we
<br>can, something about them, according to the measure of our ability,
saying
<br>by way of preface, as I said before of the Gods, that of the truth
about
<br>them we know nothing, and do but entertain human notions of them.&nbsp;
And in
<br>this present enquiry, let us say to ourselves, before we proceed, that
the
<br>higher method is the one which we or others who would analyse language
to
<br>any good purpose must follow; but under the circumstances, as men say,
we
<br>must do as well as we can.&nbsp; What do you think?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; I very much approve.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That objects should be imitated in letters and syllables,
and so
<br>find expression, may appear ridiculous, Hermogenes, but it cannot be
<br>avoided--there is no better principle to which we can look for the
truth of
<br>first names.&nbsp; Deprived of this, we must have recourse to divine
help, like
<br>the tragic poets, who in any perplexity have their gods waiting in
the air;
<br>and must get out of our difficulty in like fashion, by saying that
'the
<br>Gods gave the first names, and therefore they are right.'&nbsp; This
will be the
<br>best contrivance, or perhaps that other notion may be even better still,
of
<br>deriving them from some barbarous people, for the barbarians are older
than
<br>we are; or we may say that antiquity has cast a veil over them, which
is
<br>the same sort of excuse as the last; for all these are not reasons
but only
<br>ingenious excuses for having no reasons concerning the truth of words.&nbsp;
And
<br>yet any sort of ignorance of first or primitive names involves an ignorance
<br>of secondary words; for they can only be explained by the primary.&nbsp;
Clearly
<br>then the professor of languages should be able to give a very lucid
<br>explanation of first names, or let him be assured he will only talk
<br>nonsense about the rest.&nbsp; Do you not suppose this to be true?
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Certainly, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; My first notions of original names are truly wild and
<br>ridiculous, though I have no objection to impart them to you if you
desire,
<br>and I hope that you will communicate to me in return anything better
which
<br>you may have.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; Fear not; I will do my best.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; In the first place, the letter rho appears to me to
be the
<br>general instrument expressing all motion (kinesis).&nbsp; But I have
not yet
<br>explained the meaning of this latter word, which is just iesis (going);
for
<br>the letter eta was not in use among the ancients, who only employed
<br>epsilon; and the root is kiein, which is a foreign form, the same as
ienai.
<br>And the old word kinesis will be correctly given as iesis in corresponding
<br>modern letters.&nbsp; Assuming this foreign root kiein, and allowing
for the
<br>change of the eta and the insertion of the nu, we have kinesis, which
<br>should have been kieinsis or eisis; and stasis is the negative of ienai
(or
<br>eisis), and has been improved into stasis.&nbsp; Now the letter rho,
as I was
<br>saying, appeared to the imposer of names an excellent instrument for
the
<br>expression of motion; and he frequently uses the letter for this purpose:
<br>for example, in the actual words rein and roe he represents motion
by rho;
<br>also in the words tromos (trembling), trachus (rugged); and again,
in words
<br>such as krouein (strike), thrauein (crush), ereikein (bruise), thruptein
<br>(break), kermatixein (crumble), rumbein (whirl):&nbsp; of all these
sorts of
<br>movements he generally finds an expression in the letter R, because,
as I
<br>imagine, he had observed that the tongue was most agitated and least
at
<br>rest in the pronunciation of this letter, which he therefore used in
order
<br>to express motion, just as by the letter iota he expresses the subtle
<br>elements which pass through all things.&nbsp; This is why he uses the
letter
<br>iota as imitative of motion, ienai, iesthai.&nbsp; And there is another
class of
<br>letters, phi, psi, sigma, and xi, of which the pronunciation is accompanied
<br>by great expenditure of breath; these are used in the imitation of
such
<br>notions as psuchron (shivering), xeon (seething), seiesthai, (to be
<br>shaken), seismos (shock), and are always introduced by the giver of
names
<br>when he wants to imitate what is phusodes (windy).&nbsp; He seems to
have
<br>thought that the closing and pressure of the tongue in the utterance
of
<br>delta and tau was expressive of binding and rest in a place:&nbsp;
he further
<br>observed the liquid movement of lambda, in the pronunciation of which
the
<br>tongue slips, and in this he found the expression of smoothness, as
in
<br>leios (level), and in the word oliothanein (to slip) itself, liparon
<br>(sleek), in the word kollodes (gluey), and the like:&nbsp; the heavier
sound of
<br>gamma detained the slipping tongue, and the union of the two gave the
<br>notion of a glutinous clammy nature, as in glischros, glukus, gloiodes.
<br>The nu he observed to be sounded from within, and therefore to have
a
<br>notion of inwardness; hence he introduced the sound in endos and entos:
<br>alpha he assigned to the expression of size, and nu of length, because
they
<br>are great letters:&nbsp; omicron was the sign of roundness, and therefore
there
<br>is plenty of omicron mixed up in the word goggulon (round).&nbsp; Thus
did the
<br>legislator, reducing all things into letters and syllables, and impressing
<br>on them names and signs, and out of them by imitation compounding other
<br>signs.&nbsp; That is my view, Hermogenes, of the truth of names; but
I should
<br>like to hear what Cratylus has more to say.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; But, Socrates, as I was telling you before, Cratylus
mystifies
<br>me; he says that there is a fitness of names, but he never explains
what is
<br>this fitness, so that I cannot tell whether his obscurity is intended
or
<br>not.&nbsp; Tell me now, Cratylus, here in the presence of Socrates,
do you agree
<br>in what Socrates has been saying about names, or have you something
better
<br>of your own? and if you have, tell me what your view is, and then you
will
<br>either learn of Socrates, or Socrates and I will learn of you.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Well, but surely, Hermogenes, you do not suppose that
you can
<br>learn, or I explain, any subject of importance all in a moment; at
any
<br>rate, not such a subject as language, which is, perhaps, the very greatest
<br>of all.
</p><p>HERMOGENES:&nbsp; No, indeed; but, as Hesiod says, and I agree with
him, 'to add
<br>little to little' is worth while.&nbsp; And, therefore, if you think
that you
<br>can add anything at all, however small, to our knowledge, take a little
<br>trouble and oblige Socrates, and me too, who certainly have a claim
upon
<br>you.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I am by no means positive, Cratylus, in the view which
<br>Hermogenes and myself have worked out; and therefore do not hesitate
to say
<br>what you think, which if it be better than my own view I shall gladly
<br>accept.&nbsp; And I should not be at all surprized to find that you
have found
<br>some better notion.&nbsp; For you have evidently reflected on these
matters and
<br>have had teachers, and if you have really a better theory of the truth
of
<br>names, you may count me in the number of your disciples.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; You are right, Socrates, in saying that I have made
a study of
<br>these matters, and I might possibly convert you into a disciple.&nbsp;
But I
<br>fear that the opposite is more probable, and I already find myself
moved to
<br>say to you what Achilles in the 'Prayers' says to Ajax,--
</p><p>'Illustrious Ajax, son of Telamon, lord of the people,
<br>You appear to have spoken in all things much to my mind.'
</p><p>And you, Socrates, appear to me to be an oracle, and to give answers
much
<br>to my mind, whether you are inspired by Euthyphro, or whether some
Muse may
<br>have long been an inhabitant of your breast, unconsciously to yourself.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Excellent Cratylus, I have long been wondering at my
own wisdom;
<br>I cannot trust myself.&nbsp; And I think that I ought to stop and ask
myself
<br>What am I saying? for there is nothing worse than self-deception--when
the
<br>deceiver is always at home and always with you--it is quite terrible,
and
<br>therefore I ought often to retrace my steps and endeavour to 'look
fore and
<br>aft,' in the words of the aforesaid Homer.&nbsp; And now let me see;
where are
<br>we?&nbsp; Have we not been saying that the correct name indicates the
nature of
<br>the thing:--has this proposition been sufficiently proven?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, what you say, as I am disposed to think,
is quite
<br>true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Names, then, are given in order to instruct?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And naming is an art, and has artificers?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And who are they?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; The legislators, of whom you spoke at first.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And does this art grow up among men like other arts?&nbsp;
Let me
<br>explain what I mean:&nbsp; of painters, some are better and some worse?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; The better painters execute their works, I mean their
figures,
<br>better, and the worse execute them worse; and of builders also, the
better
<br>sort build fairer houses, and the worse build them worse.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And among legislators, there are some who do their work
better
<br>and some worse?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; No; there I do not agree with you.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then you do not think that some laws are better and
others
<br>worse?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; No, indeed.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Or that one name is better than another?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly not.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then all names are rightly imposed?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, if they are names at all.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, what do you say to the name of our friend Hermogenes,
<br>which was mentioned before:--assuming that he has nothing of the nature
of
<br>Hermes in him, shall we say that this is a wrong name, or not his name
at
<br>all?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should reply that Hermogenes is not his name at all,
but only
<br>appears to be his, and is really the name of somebody else, who has
the
<br>nature which corresponds to it.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And if a man were to call him Hermogenes, would he not
be even
<br>speaking falsely?&nbsp; For there may be a doubt whether you can call
him
<br>Hermogenes, if he is not.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; What do you mean?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Are you maintaining that falsehood is impossible?&nbsp;
For if this
<br>is your meaning I should answer, that there have been plenty of liars
in
<br>all ages.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Why, Socrates, how can a man say that which is not?--say
<br>something and yet say nothing?&nbsp; For is not falsehood saying the
thing which
<br>is not?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Your argument, friend, is too subtle for a man of my
age.&nbsp; But I
<br>should like to know whether you are one of those philosophers who think
<br>that falsehood may be spoken but not said?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Neither spoken nor said.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Nor uttered nor addressed?&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;
If a person, saluting
<br>you in a foreign country, were to take your hand and say:&nbsp; 'Hail,
Athenian
<br>stranger, Hermogenes, son of Smicrion'--these words, whether spoken,
said,
<br>uttered, or addressed, would have no application to you but only to
our
<br>friend Hermogenes, or perhaps to nobody at all?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; In my opinion, Socrates, the speaker would only be talking
<br>nonsense.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, but that will be quite enough for me, if you will
tell me
<br>whether the nonsense would be true or false, or partly true and partly
<br>false:--which is all that I want to know.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should say that he would be putting himself in motion
to no
<br>purpose; and that his words would be an unmeaning sound like the noise
of
<br>hammering at a brazen pot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But let us see, Cratylus, whether we cannot find a meeting-
<br>point, for you would admit that the name is not the same with the thing
<br>named?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And would you further acknowledge that the name is an
imitation
<br>of the thing?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And you would say that pictures are also imitations
of things,
<br>but in another way?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I believe you may be right, but I do not rightly understand
you.
<br>Please to say, then, whether both sorts of imitation (I mean both pictures
<br>or words) are not equally attributable and applicable to the things
of
<br>which they are the imitation.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; They are.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; First look at the matter thus:&nbsp; you may attribute
the likeness
<br>of the man to the man, and of the woman to the woman; and so on?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And conversely you may attribute the likeness of the
man to the
<br>woman, and of the woman to the man?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And are both modes of assigning them right, or only
the first?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Only the first.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is to say, the mode of assignment which attributes
to each
<br>that which belongs to them and is like them?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; That is my view.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Now then, as I am desirous that we being friends should
have a
<br>good understanding about the argument, let me state my view to you:&nbsp;
the
<br>first mode of assignment, whether applied to figures or to names, I
call
<br>right, and when applied to names only, true as well as right; and the
other
<br>mode of giving and assigning the name which is unlike, I call wrong,
and in
<br>the case of names, false as well as wrong.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; That may be true, Socrates, in the case of pictures;
they may be
<br>wrongly assigned; but not in the case of names--they must be always
right.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Why, what is the difference?&nbsp; May I not go to a
man and say to
<br>him, 'This is your picture,' showing him his own likeness, or perhaps
the
<br>likeness of a woman; and when I say 'show,' I mean bring before the
sense
<br>of sight.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And may I not go to him again, and say, 'This is your
name'?--
<br>for the name, like the picture, is an imitation.&nbsp; May I not say
to him--
<br>'This is your name'? and may I not then bring to his sense of hearing
the
<br>imitation of himself, when I say, 'This is a man'; or of a female of
the
<br>human species, when I say, 'This is a woman,' as the case may be?&nbsp;
Is not
<br>all that quite possible?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I would fain agree with you, Socrates; and therefore
I say,
<br>Granted.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; That is very good of you, if I am right, which need
hardly be
<br>disputed at present.&nbsp; But if I can assign names as well as pictures
to
<br>objects, the right assignment of them we may call truth, and the wrong
<br>assignment of them falsehood.&nbsp; Now if there be such a wrong assignment
of
<br>names, there may also be a wrong or inappropriate assignment of verbs;
and
<br>if of names and verbs then of the sentences, which are made up of them.
<br>What do you say, Cratylus?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I agree; and think that what you say is very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And further, primitive nouns may be compared to pictures,
and in
<br>pictures you may either give all the appropriate colours and figures,
or
<br>you may not give them all--some may be wanting; or there may be too
many or
<br>too much of them--may there not?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And he who gives all gives a perfect picture or figure;
and he
<br>who takes away or adds also gives a picture or figure, but not a good
one.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; In like manner, he who by syllables and letters imitates
the
<br>nature of things, if he gives all that is appropriate will produce
a good
<br>image, or in other words a name; but if he subtracts or perhaps adds
a
<br>little, he will make an image but not a good one; whence I infer that
some
<br>names are well and others ill made.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; That is true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then the artist of names may be sometimes good, or he
may be
<br>bad?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And this artist of names is called the legislator?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then like other artists the legislator may be good or
he may be
<br>bad; it must surely be so if our former admissions hold good?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Very true, Socrates; but the case of language, you see,
is
<br>different; for when by the help of grammar we assign the letters alpha
or
<br>beta, or any other letters to a certain name, then, if we add, or subtract,
<br>or misplace a letter, the name which is written is not only written
<br>wrongly, but not written at all; and in any of these cases becomes
other
<br>than a name.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But I doubt whether your view is altogether correct,
Cratylus.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I believe that what you say may be true about numbers,
which
<br>must be just what they are, or not be at all; for example, the number
ten
<br>at once becomes other than ten if a unit be added or subtracted, and
so of
<br>any other number:&nbsp; but this does not apply to that which is qualitative
or
<br>to anything which is represented under an image.&nbsp; I should say
rather that
<br>the image, if expressing in every point the entire reality, would no
longer
<br>be an image.&nbsp; Let us suppose the existence of two objects:&nbsp;
one of them
<br>shall be Cratylus, and the other the image of Cratylus; and we will
<br>suppose, further, that some God makes not only a representation such
as a
<br>painter would make of your outward form and colour, but also creates
an
<br>inward organization like yours, having the same warmth and softness;
and
<br>into this infuses motion, and soul, and mind, such as you have, and
in a
<br>word copies all your qualities, and places them by you in another form;
<br>would you say that this was Cratylus and the image of Cratylus, or
that
<br>there were two Cratyluses?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should say that there were two Cratyluses.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then you see, my friend, that we must find some other
principle
<br>of truth in images, and also in names; and not insist that an image
is no
<br>longer an image when something is added or subtracted.&nbsp; Do you
not perceive
<br>that images are very far from having qualities which are the exact
<br>counterpart of the realities which they represent?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, I see.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But then how ridiculous would be the effect of names
on things,
<br>if they were exactly the same with them!&nbsp; For they would be the
doubles of
<br>them, and no one would be able to determine which were the names and
which
<br>were the realities.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Quite true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then fear not, but have the courage to admit that one
name may
<br>be correctly and another incorrectly given; and do not insist that
the name
<br>shall be exactly the same with the thing; but allow the occasional
<br>substitution of a wrong letter, and if of a letter also of a noun in
a
<br>sentence, and if of a noun in a sentence also of a sentence which is
not
<br>appropriate to the matter, and acknowledge that the thing may be named,
and
<br>described, so long as the general character of the thing which you
are
<br>describing is retained; and this, as you will remember, was remarked
by
<br>Hermogenes and myself in the particular instance of the names of the
<br>letters.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, I remember.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Good; and when the general character is preserved, even
if some
<br>of the proper letters are wanting, still the thing is signified;--well,
if
<br>all the letters are given; not well, when only a few of them are given.&nbsp;
I
<br>think that we had better admit this, lest we be punished like travellers
in
<br>Aegina who wander about the street late at night:&nbsp; and be likewise
told by
<br>truth herself that we have arrived too late; or if not, you must find
out
<br>some new notion of correctness of names, and no longer maintain that
a name
<br>is the expression of a thing in letters or syllables; for if you say
both,
<br>you will be inconsistent with yourself.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I quite acknowledge, Socrates, what you say to be very
<br>reasonable.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then as we are agreed thus far, let us ask ourselves
whether a
<br>name rightly imposed ought not to have the proper letters.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And the proper letters are those which are like the
things?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Enough then of names which are rightly given.&nbsp;
And in names
<br>which are incorrectly given, the greater part may be supposed to be
made up
<br>of proper and similar letters, or there would be no likeness; but there
<br>will be likewise a part which is improper and spoils the beauty and
<br>formation of the word:&nbsp; you would admit that?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; There would be no use, Socrates, in my quarrelling with
you,
<br>since I cannot be satisfied that a name which is incorrectly given
is a
<br>name at all.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Do you admit a name to be the representation of a thing?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, I do.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But do you not allow that some nouns are primitive,
and some
<br>derived?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, I do.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then if you admit that primitive or first nouns are
<br>representations of things, is there any better way of framing
<br>representations than by assimilating them to the objects as much as
you
<br>can; or do you prefer the notion of Hermogenes and of many others,
who say
<br>that names are conventional, and have a meaning to those who have agreed
<br>about them, and who have previous knowledge of the things intended
by them,
<br>and that convention is the only principle; and whether you abide by
our
<br>present convention, or make a new and opposite one, according to which
you
<br>call small great and great small--that, they would say, makes no
<br>difference, if you are only agreed.&nbsp; Which of these two notions
do you
<br>prefer?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Representation by likeness, Socrates, is infinitely
better than
<br>representation by any chance sign.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Very good:&nbsp; but if the name is to be like the thing,
the letters
<br>out of which the first names are composed must also be like things.
<br>Returning to the image of the picture, I would ask, How could any one
ever
<br>compose a picture which would be like anything at all, if there were
not
<br>pigments in nature which resembled the things imitated, and out of
which
<br>the picture is composed?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Impossible.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; No more could names ever resemble any actually existing
thing,
<br>unless the original elements of which they are compounded bore some
degree
<br>of resemblance to the objects of which the names are the imitation:&nbsp;
And
<br>the original elements are letters?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Let me now invite you to consider what Hermogenes and
I were
<br>saying about sounds.&nbsp; Do you agree with me that the letter rho
is
<br>expressive of rapidity, motion, and hardness?&nbsp; Were we right or
wrong in
<br>saying so?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should say that you were right.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And that lamda was expressive of smoothness, and softness,
and
<br>the like?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; There again you were right.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And yet, as you are aware, that which is called by us
sklerotes,
<br>is by the Eretrians called skleroter.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Very true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But are the letters rho and sigma equivalents; and is
there the
<br>same significance to them in the termination rho, which there is to
us in
<br>sigma, or is there no significance to one of us?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Nay, surely there is a significance to both of us.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; In as far as they are like, or in as far as they are
unlike?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; In as far as they are like.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Are they altogether alike?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes; for the purpose of expressing motion.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And what do you say of the insertion of the lamda? for
that is
<br>expressive not of hardness but of softness.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Why, perhaps the letter lamda is wrongly inserted, Socrates,
and
<br>should be altered into rho, as you were saying to Hermogenes and in
my
<br>opinion rightly, when you spoke of adding and subtracting letters upon
<br>occasion.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; But still the word is intelligible to both
of us; when I
<br>say skleros (hard), you know what I mean.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, my dear friend, and the explanation of that is
custom.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And what is custom but convention?&nbsp; I utter a sound
which I
<br>understand, and you know that I understand the meaning of the sound:&nbsp;
this
<br>is what you are saying?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And if when I speak you know my meaning, there is an
indication
<br>given by me to you?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; This indication of my meaning may proceed from unlike
as well as
<br>from like, for example in the lamda of sklerotes.&nbsp; But if this
is true,
<br>then you have made a convention with yourself, and the correctness
of a
<br>name turns out to be convention, since letters which are unlike are
<br>indicative equally with those which are like, if they are sanctioned
by
<br>custom and convention.&nbsp; And even supposing that you distinguish
custom from
<br>convention ever so much, still you must say that the signification
of words
<br>is given by custom and not by likeness, for custom may indicate by
the
<br>unlike as well as by the like.&nbsp; But as we are agreed thus far,
Cratylus
<br>(for I shall assume that your silence gives consent), then custom and
<br>convention must be supposed to contribute to the indication of our
<br>thoughts; for suppose we take the instance of number, how can you ever
<br>imagine, my good friend, that you will find names resembling every
<br>individual number, unless you allow that which you term convention
and
<br>agreement to have authority in determining the correctness of names?&nbsp;
I
<br>quite agree with you that words should as far as possible resemble
things;
<br>but I fear that this dragging in of resemblance, as Hermogenes says,
is a
<br>shabby thing, which has to be supplemented by the mechanical aid of
<br>convention with a view to correctness; for I believe that if we could
<br>always, or almost always, use likenesses, which are perfectly appropriate,
<br>this would be the most perfect state of language; as the opposite is
the
<br>most imperfect.&nbsp; But let me ask you, what is the force of names,
and what
<br>is the use of them?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; The use of names, Socrates, as I should imagine, is
to inform:
<br>the simple truth is, that he who knows names knows also the things
which
<br>are expressed by them.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; I suppose you mean to say, Cratylus, that as the name
is, so
<br>also is the thing; and that he who knows the one will also know the
other,
<br>because they are similars, and all similars fall under the same art
or
<br>science; and therefore you would say that he who knows names will also
know
<br>things.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; That is precisely what I mean.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But let us consider what is the nature of this information
about
<br>things which, according to you, is given us by names.&nbsp; Is it the
best sort
<br>of information? or is there any other?&nbsp; What do you say?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I believe that to be both the only and the best sort
of
<br>information about them; there can be no other.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But do you believe that in the discovery of them, he
who
<br>discovers the names discovers also the things; or is this only the
method
<br>of instruction, and is there some other method of enquiry and discovery.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I certainly believe that the methods of enquiry and
discovery
<br>are of the same nature as instruction.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, but do you not see, Cratylus, that he who follows
names in
<br>the search after things, and analyses their meaning, is in great danger
of
<br>being deceived?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; How so?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Why clearly he who first gave names gave them according
to his
<br>conception of the things which they signified--did he not?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And if his conception was erroneous, and he gave names
according
<br>to his conception, in what position shall we who are his followers
find
<br>ourselves?&nbsp; Shall we not be deceived by him?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; But, Socrates, am I not right in thinking that he must
surely
<br>have known; or else, as I was saying, his names would not be names
at all?
<br>And you have a clear proof that he has not missed the truth, and the
proof
<br>is--that he is perfectly consistent.&nbsp; Did you ever observe in
speaking that
<br>all the words which you utter have a common character and purpose?
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But that, friend Cratylus, is no answer.&nbsp; For if
he did begin in
<br>error, he may have forced the remainder into agreement with the original
<br>error and with himself; there would be nothing strange in this, any
more
<br>than in geometrical diagrams, which have often a slight and invisible
flaw
<br>in the first part of the process, and are consistently mistaken in
the long
<br>deductions which follow.&nbsp; And this is the reason why every man
should
<br>expend his chief thought and attention on the consideration of his
first
<br>principles:--are they or are they not rightly laid down? and when he
has
<br>duly sifted them, all the rest will follow.&nbsp; Now I should be astonished
to
<br>find that names are really consistent.&nbsp; And here let us revert
to our
<br>former discussion:&nbsp; Were we not saying that all things are in
motion and
<br>progress and flux, and that this idea of motion is expressed by names?&nbsp;
Do
<br>you not conceive that to be the meaning of them?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes; that is assuredly their meaning, and the true meaning.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Let us revert to episteme (knowledge) and observe how
ambiguous
<br>this word is, seeming rather to signify stopping the soul at things
than
<br>going round with them; and therefore we should leave the beginning
as at
<br>present, and not reject the epsilon, but make an insertion of an iota
<br>instead of an epsilon (not pioteme, but epiisteme).&nbsp; Take another
example:
<br>bebaion (sure) is clearly the expression of station and position, and
not
<br>of motion.&nbsp; Again, the word istoria (enquiry) bears upon the face
of it the
<br>stopping (istanai) of the stream; and the word piston (faithful) certainly
<br>indicates cessation of motion; then, again, mneme (memory), as any
one may
<br>see, expresses rest in the soul, and not motion.&nbsp; Moreover, words
such as
<br>amartia and sumphora, which have a bad sense, viewed in the light of
their
<br>etymologies will be the same as sunesis and episteme and other words
which
<br>have a good sense (compare omartein, sunienai, epesthai, sumpheresthai);
<br>and much the same may be said of amathia and akolasia, for amathia
may be
<br>explained as e ama theo iontos poreia, and akolasia as e akolouthia
tois
<br>pragmasin.&nbsp; Thus the names which in these instances we find to
have the
<br>worst sense, will turn out to be framed on the same principle as those
<br>which have the best.&nbsp; And any one I believe who would take the
trouble
<br>might find many other examples in which the giver of names indicates,
not
<br>that things are in motion or progress, but that they are at rest; which
is
<br>the opposite of motion.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, but observe; the greater number express
motion.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; What of that, Cratylus?&nbsp; Are we to count them like
votes? and is
<br>correctness of names the voice of the majority?&nbsp; Are we to say
of whichever
<br>sort there are most, those are the true ones?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; No; that is not reasonable.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; But let us have done with this
question and
<br>proceed to another, about which I should like to know whether you think
<br>with me.&nbsp; Were we not lately acknowledging that the first givers
of names
<br>in states, both Hellenic and barbarous, were the legislators, and that
the
<br>art which gave names was the art of the legislator?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Quite true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Tell me, then, did the first legislators, who were the
givers of
<br>the first names, know or not know the things which they named?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; They must have known, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Why, yes, friend Cratylus, they could hardly have been
ignorant.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should say not.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Let us return to the point from which we digressed.&nbsp;
You were
<br>saying, if you remember, that he who gave names must have known the
things
<br>which he named; are you still of that opinion?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I am.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And would you say that the giver of the first names
had also a
<br>knowledge of the things which he named?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But how could he have learned or discovered things from
names if
<br>the primitive names were not yet given?&nbsp; For, if we are correct
in our
<br>view, the only way of learning and discovering things, is either to
<br>discover names for ourselves or to learn them from others.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I think that there is a good deal in what you say, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But if things are only to be known through names, how
can we
<br>suppose that the givers of names had knowledge, or were legislators
before
<br>there were names at all, and therefore before they could have known
them?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I believe, Socrates, the true account of the matter
to be, that
<br>a power more than human gave things their first names, and that the
names
<br>which are thus given are necessarily their true names.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then how came the giver of the names, if he was an inspired
<br>being or God, to contradict himself?&nbsp; For were we not saying just
now that
<br>he made some names expressive of rest and others of motion?&nbsp; Were
we
<br>mistaken?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; But I suppose one of the two not to be names at all.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And which, then, did he make, my good friend; those
which are
<br>expressive of rest, or those which are expressive of motion?&nbsp;
This is a
<br>point which, as I said before, cannot be determined by counting them.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; No; not in that way, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But if this is a battle of names, some of them asserting
that
<br>they are like the truth, others contending that THEY are, how or by
what
<br>criterion are we to decide between them?&nbsp; For there are no other
names to
<br>which appeal can be made, but obviously recourse must be had to another
<br>standard which, without employing names, will make clear which of the
two
<br>are right; and this must be a standard which shows the truth of things.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I agree.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But if that is true, Cratylus, then I suppose that things
may be
<br>known without names?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Clearly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; But how would you expect to know them?&nbsp; What other
way can there
<br>be of knowing them, except the true and natural way, through their
<br>affinities, when they are akin to each other, and through themselves?&nbsp;
For
<br>that which is other and different from them must signify something
other
<br>and different from them.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; What you are saying is, I think, true.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Well, but reflect; have we not several times acknowledged
that
<br>names rightly given are the likenesses and images of the things which
they
<br>name?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Yes.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Let us suppose that to any extent you please you can
learn
<br>things through the medium of names, and suppose also that you can learn
<br>them from the things themselves--which is likely to be the nobler and
<br>clearer way; to learn of the image, whether the image and the truth
of
<br>which the image is the expression have been rightly conceived, or to
learn
<br>of the truth whether the truth and the image of it have been duly executed?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I should say that we must learn of the truth.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; How real existence is to be studied or discovered is,
I suspect,
<br>beyond you and me.&nbsp; But we may admit so much, that the knowledge
of things
<br>is not to be derived from names.&nbsp; No; they must be studied and
investigated
<br>in themselves.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Clearly, Socrates.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; There is another point.&nbsp; I should not like us to
be imposed upon
<br>by the appearance of such a multitude of names, all tending in the
same
<br>direction.&nbsp; I myself do not deny that the givers of names did
really give
<br>them under the idea that all things were in motion and flux; which
was
<br>their sincere but, I think, mistaken opinion.&nbsp; And having fallen
into a
<br>kind of whirlpool themselves, they are carried round, and want to drag
us
<br>in after them.&nbsp; There is a matter, master Cratylus, about which
I often
<br>dream, and should like to ask your opinion:&nbsp; Tell me, whether
there is or
<br>is not any absolute beauty or good, or any other absolute existence?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly, Socrates, I think so.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then let us seek the true beauty:&nbsp; not asking whether
a face is
<br>fair, or anything of that sort, for all such things appear to be in
a flux;
<br>but let us ask whether the true beauty is not always beautiful.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; And can we rightly speak of a beauty which is always
passing
<br>away, and is first this and then that; must not the same thing be born
and
<br>retire and vanish while the word is in our mouths?
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Undoubtedly.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then how can that be a real thing which is never in
the same
<br>state? for obviously things which are the same cannot change while
they
<br>remain the same; and if they are always the same and in the same state,
and
<br>never depart from their original form, they can never change or be
moved.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Certainly they cannot.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Nor yet can they be known by any one; for at the moment
that the
<br>observer approaches, then they become other and of another nature,
so that
<br>you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state, for you
cannot
<br>know that which has no state.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; True.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Nor can we reasonably say, Cratylus, that there is knowledge
at
<br>all, if everything is in a state of transition and there is nothing
<br>abiding; for knowledge too cannot continue to be knowledge unless
<br>continuing always to abide and exist.&nbsp; But if the very nature
of knowledge
<br>changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge;
and
<br>if the transition is always going on, there will always be no knowledge,
<br>and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing
to be
<br>known:&nbsp; but if that which knows and that which is known exists
ever, and
<br>the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I
do not
<br>think that they can resemble a process or flux, as we were just now
<br>supposing.&nbsp; Whether there is this eternal nature in things, or
whether the
<br>truth is what Heracleitus and his followers and many others say, is
a
<br>question hard to determine; and no man of sense will like to put himself
or
<br>the education of his mind in the power of names:&nbsp; neither will
he so far
<br>trust names or the givers of names as to be confident in any knowledge
<br>which condemns himself and other existences to an unhealthy state of
<br>unreality; he will not believe that all things leak like a pot, or
imagine
<br>that the world is a man who has a running at the nose.&nbsp; This may
be true,
<br>Cratylus, but is also very likely to be untrue; and therefore I would
not
<br>have you be too easily persuaded of it.&nbsp; Reflect well and like
a man, and
<br>do not easily accept such a doctrine; for you are young and of an age
to
<br>learn.&nbsp; And when you have found the truth, come and tell me.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; I will do as you say, though I can assure you, Socrates,
that I
<br>have been considering the matter already, and the result of a great
deal of
<br>trouble and consideration is that I incline to Heracleitus.
</p><p>SOCRATES:&nbsp; Then, another day, my friend, when you come back, you
shall give
<br>me a lesson; but at present, go into the country, as you are intending,
and
<br>Hermogenes shall set you on your way.
</p><p>CRATYLUS:&nbsp; Very good, Socrates; I hope, however, that you will
continue to
<br>think about these things yourself.
