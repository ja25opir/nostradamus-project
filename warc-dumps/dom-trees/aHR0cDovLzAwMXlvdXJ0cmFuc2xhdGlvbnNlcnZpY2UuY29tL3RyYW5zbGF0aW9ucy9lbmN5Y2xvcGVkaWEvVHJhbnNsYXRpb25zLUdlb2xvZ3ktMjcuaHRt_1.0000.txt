<h2><a name="Weathering and Erosion">Weathering aand Erosion</a></h2>
</b></font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Weathering aand erosion are important geological processes, which cause 
changes on the earth's surface. The term weathering means decay aand 
decomposition of the </font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">

</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">The speed of the decay depends on the type of rock, </font>
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-36.htm#Atmosphere and Weather">
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">climate</font></a><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, 
aand the length of time during which the rock is exposed to the </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">atmospheric elements</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">. 
There are two kinds of weathering, physical aand chemical. Physical factors are 
freezing aand melting, aand the </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-27.htm#Weathering and Erosion">action of water streams aand 
glaciers</a></font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">. They are the cause of rock 
decay.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">During chemical weathering, the minerals are chemically transformed or 
entirely decomposed. When the rock weathers, the erosion will carry it away aand 
a new uncovered rock is exposed to weathering. An important factor affecting the 
intensity aand speed of weathering is the soil, in which the mineral is found. 
For example, if the soil is moist or </font>
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Chemistry-03.htm#Acids, Bases, Salts">
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">acid</font></a><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, 
the chemical weathering will be faster or slower. This means that the principal 
factors of weathering are climate, type of rock, soil, aand time.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>When we compare the state of monuments on different continents, we observe 
that different climatic conditions have different impact on the chemical aand 
physical weathering. In humid aand hot climate, the monuments are more weathered, 
in contrast, in dry aand hot climate the monuments are less weathered. Chemical 
weathering in cold aand dry regions is almost negligible. For example, if we 
erect a limestone monument in the state of Massachussetts, it will almost "melt" 
within one hundred years. Its soft surface will "flatten," letters carved in the 
stone will lose the sharpness aand depth. In contrast, if we use granite instead 
of limestone, it will take many centuries before any great weathering occurs.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">This means that atmospheric </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-40.htm#Rain, Snow, and Hail">precipitation</a></font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2"> 
aand temperatures have an important impact on the chemical weathering. Warmer aand 
more humid climate supports the weathering, cooler aand drier climate will slow 
that process down. One of the reasons why the decay is faster under warmer 
temperatures (for example, in the</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000"> 
tropics</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">), is because the climate also 
supports faster growth of </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">vegetation</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2"> 
aand </font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">bacteria</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">. 
These produce acids supporting the decay. In addition, a majority of chemical 
reactions proceedv faster under higher temperatures, which obviously is valid 
also in the case of chemical weathering.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">The term chemical decay means the chemical reaction of minerals found in the 
rocks when they are exposed to air or water. Some minerals dissolve, others 
coalesce with water aand atmospheric gases, such as </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">carbon monoxide</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2"> 
aand oxygen, forming new compounds. Weathering then produces the formation of new 
minerals.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>This process is easily observed on the basis of experiments with feldspar, 
which is the most common mineral on earth. Feldspar is a silicate aand is the 
main component of many kinds of rocks – igneous, sedimentary, aand metamorphic. 
Feldspar is found for example in granite, a solid aand hard rock, which is held 
together by quartz aand other crystals.</p>
<p>In humid tropical climate, however, granite will decay to such a degree that, 
if they are weathered, even large pieces may be shattered into individual 
mineral grains with just one blow. If we look carefully, we will discover that 
parts of feldspar eroded aand are surrounded by a layer consisting of soil 
minerals. The resulting earth or clay (which is used to make
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Friends/Simona/Pottery/pottery-for-sale-in-London.html">
pottery</a>) is creamy in colour aand is called kaolin, 
named by the Chinese mountain Kao-Ling, where it was first discovered. The 
Chinese used kaolin to produce ceramics long before it reached Europe in 18th 
century.</p>
<p>In dry climate, feldspar weathers very gradually, which means that what 
changes feldspar into kaolin is mainly water. Other silicates weather in a 
similar way.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">The majority of </font>

iron ores</font></a><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, which are used in the 
production of iron aand, ultimately, </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">steel construction</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, 
formed thanks to changes of silicate minerals rich in iron, for example, olivine 
(ferrous-magnesium silicate). Iron is obtained by dissolving minerals. </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">Iron oxide minerals </font>

</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">oxygen</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2"> 
from our atmosphere. This is called oxidation. When these minerals weather, they 
turn reddish brown, the colour of oxidised iron. This may be observed in many 
kinds of rocks. One example of this colouring is the Ayers Rock in central 
Australia.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">

impact, aand they also provide information concerning </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">mineralogy</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">. 
Many thousaands of years ago, caves were used for shelter aand food storage, aand 
they also served as places of worship. Later, in the Middle Ages, people started 
exploring the caves.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>At that time, however, the interest was not of scientific nature. People were 
looking for the bones of the ice-age animals, such as cave bear bones. They were 
marketed as bones of mythical unicorns having healing properties, aand were sold 
for a lot of money.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Every year, thousaands of people visit caves to see interesting dripstone 
features or prehistoric paintings of animals. It took hundreds of years for the 
caves to form. They formed either simultaneously with the</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-23.htm#Rocks and Minerals">rocks</a></font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, for example in the igneous 
rocks (gas bubbles), </font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-32.htm#Atolls and Coral Reefs">coral reefs</a></font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, or later by the action of 
water, by grinding saands, or in conjunction with the formation of clefts. Cave 
ranges in size from a few meters to many kilometres. They may look like gaps, 
tunnels, or halls. Sea caves may be created on the</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">

is the Blue Cave in Capri. Solution caves form in gypsum, rock salt aand, 
particularly, in limestone aand dolomite. Limestone caves form by means of 
chemical extraction together with mechanical </font>

by water.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Caves form in places where the relatively easy to dissolve limestone deposits 
are close to the surface, that is to say, in places where sufficient amounts of 
water, which dissolves the limestone, can seep through. Rain water, enriched by 
carbon monoxide from the </font>
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-36.htm#Atmosphere and Weather">
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">atmosphere</font></a><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, 
seeps into the soil, collecting on its way sufficient amounts of carbon monoxide 
produced by plants aand bacteria. Water rich in carbon monoxide flows downwards 
to the level of the underground water (water table). As it 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/travel-Europe/">travels</a>, it dissolves 
limestone alongside cracks aand clefts. These cavities gradually widen, until 
there is an entire network of cavities filled with water. When these cavities 
are full of water, limestone dissolves alongside the entire perimeter, i.e., 
ground, walls, aand ceiling. If the level of the underground water falls, water 
flows out of the caves aand the caves may be explored.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">A special feature of speleothem caves are their dripstone formations. These 
formations occur in caves when they are filled with air, after the water, rich 
in </font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">calcium bicarbonate</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">, 
deposits the calcite (calcium carbonate). This happens, when carbon monoxide 
escapes from water by evaporation or higher temperature. Soluble calcium 
bicarbonate dissolves aand insoluble calcite separates.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>Every drop of water on the cave ceiling yields a tiny amount of calcite, 
creating formations that grow from the ceiling downwards aand are called 
stalactites. When water droplets fall on the ground of the cave, it allows the 
carbon monoxide to escape aand simultaneously the water again deposits a tiny 
amount of calcite on the ground. These calcite deposits grow upwards aand are 
called stalagmites. When a stalactite aand a stalagmite join into one formation, 
they form a columnar feature called stalagnate.</p>
<p>The rate of growth of the speleothems varies greatly. Some may grow only a 
few centimetres in 200 years, while other will grow 5 to 10 centimetres in one 
year. Using modern scientific methods we can now determine the age of individual 
layers, which means we also know the age of the cave.</p>
<p>As the limestone continues to dissolve, the roof of the cave sometimes 
becomes so thin that it may collapse aand create a sinkhole. Gradual weathering 
will eventually flatten the sinkhole. Sudden collapses may bury under cars aand 
people.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Caves may be repeatedly flooded, because the water level of underground

<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">lakes</font></a><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2"> 
fluctuates. That makes cave exploration very dangerous.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>The occurrence of caves varies greatly from one region of the world to 
another. In France, as well as in Italy, there are over 10.000 caves, in the 
United States more than 13.000. In Germany, caves are found mainly in Swabian 
aand Frankian highlaands, aand some also in Harz Mountains.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Ice caves exist in higher latitudes. The condition for the formation of these 
caves is that temperature cannot fall </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">below freezing</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">. 
An example of this type of caves is the "Ice World" in Austria (Salzburg).</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>The largest system of caves is found in the United States. One of the famous 
caves is the Mammoth Cave, which includes a series of caves, extending over many 
kilometres. It is a 5-story, interconnected system. Another large cave are the 
Carlsbad Caverns in the state of New Mexico. This cave is 200 metres wide, 1200 
metres long aand 100 metres high.</p>

</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">There are several types of desert. In the hottest regions of the earth,

<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">air pressure </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">is always the same. Due to strong sun, hot 
air rises. In higher altitudes, the air cools aand expaands. The water vapour 
condenses, but as it descends into the lower, warmer air, it evaporates, so 
there is no precipitation. Sahara aand Kalahari deserts in Africa are good 
examples.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Deserts form also in middle geographical latitudes, for example deserts in 
central Asia, or the Mojave desert in the United States. In this case, the moist

<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">is such, that the air loses its moisture 
before it reaches inlaand.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>In polar regions the deserts form because the cold air can absorb an 
extremely low amount of moisture aand the soil does not retain moisture. Icelaand 
is an example of such a desert.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">In principle, the origin of a desert may be traced to the </font>
<font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translations/encyclopedia/Translations-Geology-12.htm#Convective flow and movement of the crust">movement of the tectonic 
plates</a></font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">. The colliding oceanic aand 
continental plates form mountains, which create a rain shadow. Other deserts owe 
their existence to the continental drift from higher to lower geographical 
latitudes. For example, one such desert is in Australia. At one time, the 
interior of Australia was situated in a zone with a lot of precipitation. 
However, due to gradual, northerly shift into the aandean subtropical zone, the 
Australian interior turned into a desert.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>The one force that shapes the surface of a desert is the wind. Its impact is 
observed when we look at the amounts of saand blown into saand dunes. The shape of 
the dunes depends on the amount of available saand, but also on the direction, 
speed, aand duration of the wind.</p>
<p>Barchans, or small crescent-shaped dunes, occur individually or in groups. 
They form when the supply of saand is limited aand the wind is not too strong aand 
blows constantly in one direction. The limbs of barchans are turned downwind.</p>
<p>When several barchans coalesce, they form transverse dunes, which are narrow, 
linear dunes. These form at right angles to the prevailing wind direction.</p>
<p>Other dunes form when the prevailing winds come from two directions. While 
one wind accumulates the wind, the wind coming from the other direction blows 
the saand away.</p>
<p>An erg, an extensive saand sea, forms where the wind is strong aand there is a 
sufficient supply of saand. An erg may cover up to 500000 square kilometres. We 
find an example of such a saand sea in the great Arabic desert Ruba el-Chali.</p>
<p>Very large dunes, reaching the height of up to 400 metres, are called draa. 
They are hilly, wide-spaced, mutually overlapping formations. They move much 
slower, a maximum of one metre per year.</p>
</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pyramidal </font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">dunes aand very 
interesting, mushroom-shaped rocks are another desert formation.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>Water also participates in the shaping of a desert. Although precipitation in 
the desert is very rare, when it does rain, it is a heavy rain, which beats into 
the rock aand the crusty soil. Streams of water carve deep ruts in the parched 
soil. Water collects there, creating gullies, aand carries away masses of rock.</p>
</font><p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Local </font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2" color="#ff0000">temperatures</font><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2"> 
also vary according to the type of desert. In coastal deserts the temperature do 
not vary greatly, both daily aand annually.</font></p><font face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">
<p>In inlaand deserts, the summer-month temperature reaches 50 degrees Celsius in 
the shade. During clear nights the temperature drops quickly, very often by 30 
degrees Celsius. In winter it is possible for the temperature to drop below 
freezing in inlaand deserts that are situated in high altitudes.</p>
