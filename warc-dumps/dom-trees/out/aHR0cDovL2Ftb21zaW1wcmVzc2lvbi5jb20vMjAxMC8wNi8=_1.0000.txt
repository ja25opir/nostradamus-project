<p><a href="http://www.eureka.com/index.php"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2407" title="Picture 7" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Picture-7-300x130.png" alt="" width="300" height="130"></a>Do you have pets? &nbsp;Well, I have one (albeit a very large one) and we have a very hard time controlling the amount of pet hair in our home. It seems like we are sweeping the floors constantly in hopes that we are not all covered in dog hair if we sit on the floor. With the furry family member in mind, Eureka has developed a vacuum for the pet lover. &nbsp;The newest vacuum in Eureka’s lineup includes the Hair Raiser for Pets Tool.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hair Raiser for Pets tool is an innovative cleaning brush that can be used independently from the vacuum in three easy steps. &nbsp;First, the Hair Raiser gently but thoroughly removes stubborn pet hair from upholstery, fabric and even clothing. &nbsp;Then it is cleaned on-board the vacuum when the user moves the brush in and out of its holster to loosen the pet hair. &nbsp;Finally, with a flip of the switch, the collected pet hair is whisked away into the dust cup without the user ever needing to touch it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some more special features of the Eureka Pet Pal Vacuum:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.littletikes.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2371" title="littletikeslogo" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/littletikeslogo1-300x187.gif" alt="" width="300" height="187"></a>As most of you know by now, I am a huge fan of Little Tikes.  Little Tikes understands what it is like being a kid and creates wonderful products that are fun, safe and durable. I have seen Cozy Coupes that are as old as the parents of the kids playing in them. We had the opportunity to review the Little Tikes wagon a few months ago (you can read the review here) and had a wonderful experience with it.  When Little Tikes asked if we wanted to review the <a href="http://www.littletikes.com/toys/spray-rescue-fire-truck.aspx">Spray &amp; Rescue Fire Truck</a>, I was really excited.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.littletikes.com/toys/spray-rescue-fire-truck.aspx"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2372" title="Picture 1" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Picture-14-300x285.png" alt="" width="300" height="285"></a>The <a href="http://www.littletikes.com/toys/spray-rescue-fire-truck.aspx">Little Tikes Spray &amp; Rescue Fire Truck</a> is the perfect toy for the summer.  The little Fire Truck includes a working fire house that kids can use to spray anything they want (including you, so watch out).  It is a fun, exciting way to cool down this summer for kids from 1 1/2 to 5 years old.</p>
<h3><a href="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/assembly.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2375" title="assembly" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/assembly-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a>Assembly</h3>
<p>The Little Tikes Spray &amp; Rescue Fire Truck was pretty easily put together.  It came with clear directions and a couple of extra parts (great for us since we messed up on the wagon and didn’t have extra parts).  The assembly video directions are also available online.  The only thing that made assembly a little difficult was that to attach the  ladder on the back of the truck, you have to drill some holes through a couple of layers of plastic.  My husband did this for me.  He mentioned that this product was much easier to put together than the wagon was.</p>
<h3><a href="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/in-the-truck.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2376" title="in the truck" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/in-the-truck-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a>Our Experience</h3>
<p>We absolutely love the Spray &amp; Rescue Fire Truck.  We have had some pretty wet weather here in Indy for the past couple of weeks so TJ has been enjoying his fire truck indoors.  It has been a boredom buster!  He loves pushing the fire truck around the house (and after the dog, who runs away and then wants to go outside).  He loves to have his mommy push him around the house as he honks the horn and turns the steering wheel.  His cousin came over the other day and they took turns pushing each other around the house.  My nephew is about to turn two and he had a little easier time pushing himself around than TJ, but TJ is getting there.  The pressurized water hose works really well (outside, that is).  In order to build up the pressure, you must pump the handle up and down and then there is a button on the hose for your child to use to spray the water.  TJ loves to pump the handle up and down.</p>
<p>Here is a short video showing TJ in the house with his Fire Truck.<br>

Earlier this month I gave you a preview of the <a href="http://www.tassimo.com/country_selector/">Tassimo Home Brewing System </a>just in time for Father’s Day. So what makes the Tassimo special?</p>
<blockquote><p>How does TASSIMO make café style beverages so good you will swear they came from your local barista? The Secret is in the T DISC. Every T DISC contains a unique barcode that instantly tells the TASSIMO system precisely how to prepare your hot beverages.</p>
<p>TASSIMO lets you enjoy a cup of exactly what you want, right now. Simply insert your choice of T DISC, select the right cup for your drink and press the button. In about a minute you’ll savor an exquisite cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. You can brew your next delicious cup right away, knowing it will be as fresh and delightful as the one before it. No mess, no grounds and no waiting. Just pure pleasure, one cup at a time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to share our experience with the Tassimo.  We have been using the Tassimo exclusively in house as our coffee maker for the past couple of weeks and I am ready to share our thoughts. &nbsp;First, here is a little demonstration from yours truly on how the Tassimo operates:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9CDgy7ebVCw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xcc2550&amp;color2=0xe87a9f"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="490" height="270" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9CDgy7ebVCw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xcc2550&amp;color2=0xe87a9f" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></object></p>
<h3>My Thoughts:</h3>
<p>I have fallen in love with the Tassimo. &nbsp;Not only is this machine a wonderful single serve coffee maker, tea maker and hot cocoa maker, it is the only one (single serve brewer) that can also make coffee house speciality drinks like cappuccinos, lattes and mochicatos. &nbsp;I love that I don’t waste a half a carafe of coffee because I am the only one who drinks it in my house. &nbsp;I love that I can brew a cup of hot water for my tea bags without taking out the old, ugly kettle and waiting for the water to boil. &nbsp;My husband loves that it is compact and doesn’t take up a lot of space on the counter (much less than our prior coffee maker). &nbsp;He also has tried the iced late that we received with our brewer a few times. &nbsp;I absolutely love this machine. &nbsp;I am planing on taking it with me on vacation when we go up to Michigan in late July since it doesn’t take up much space.</p>
<h2>Deal Alert:</h2>
<p>I also wanted to let you know that if you register your Tassimo online, Tassimo will send you 2 free packages of T-Discs. &nbsp;Mine came within a week of registering it!</p>
<h2>Buy It:</h2>
<p>You can purchase the Tassimo <a href="http://bit.ly/BoschT20">T20 model at Target </a>for $129.99.</p>
<h2>Win It:</h2>
<p>One (1) lucky reader will win a <a href="http://www.tassimodirect.com/Tassimo/index.aspx">Tassimo T20 Home Brewer</a> from Bosch.</p>
<h4>How to Enter:</h4>

<p>This giveaway will end at midnight on July 15. Winner will be picked from Random.org.  Open to US residents only. &nbsp;Good Luck.</p>

<p><a href="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0238.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2357" title="CIMG0238" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0238-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>I left Indy last Wednesday night after my husband returned from work and took the four hour drive to St. Louis on my own (it was remarkably easy and even I didn’t get lost, which is saying something). &nbsp;I slept by myself in a very nice and comfy hotel room, a real treat for a very tired mom. &nbsp;The next morning we met up with Build-A-Bear employees in the lobby and headed over to Build-A-Bear Bearquarters. &nbsp;We were lead into the Bear University where we found our tables that we would be sitting at for the next couple of days. &nbsp;I was fortunate to be seated with <a href="http://littleredwagonfoundation.com/">Zach and Laurie Bonner</a>, Candy (<a href="http://www.mommypalooza.com/">mommypalooza</a>) and Clair (<a href="http://www.mummydeals.org/">MummyDeals</a>).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2358" title="CIMG0239" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0239-e1277603523694-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></p>
<p>We took a tour of the BearQuarters and learned a little about the process that goes into building a brand. &nbsp;Employees at the home office are allowed to bring their dogs to work and we met a lot of furry friends along the way. &nbsp;Decorating the halls of Bearquarters are all of the past and current pals that Build-A-Bear has introduced over the years. &nbsp;Here is a picture of the International Wall they have on display for the World Cup!<a href="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0245.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2359" title="CIMG0245" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0245-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>
<p>We had amazing speeches from Maxine Clark, Adrienne Wiess, Zach Bonner and Mary Heston. &nbsp;We also broke out &nbsp;into small groups and had 2 wonderful round table discussions where Build-A-Bear asked us our thoughts on different aspects of the Build-A-Bear brand.</p>
<p><a href="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0248.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2360" title="CIMG0248" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CIMG0248-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>
<p>Here is Zach Bonner, an amazing kid that you will hear a lot about in the future. &nbsp;Check out his foundation at <a href="http://littleredwagonfoundation.com/">http://littleredwagonfoundation.com/</a>.</p>
<p>That night we were invited to Maxine Clark’s home for a wonderful dinner. &nbsp;Those of us who brought kids were entertained by a magician and an amazing balloon animal artist. &nbsp;It was a great time to socialize and get to know each other. &nbsp;I met Sarah (<a href="http://tenthousandtonone.blogspot.com/">ten thousand to none</a>) from Kansas City who is expecting her first child soon.</p>
<p>I had an amazing time learning so much about what a fabulous company Build-A-Bear is and getting to know all the employees and mom bloggers in attendance. &nbsp;I will write more about day 2 later this week (it includes some new never before seen products that you do not want to miss).</p>
<h6>Build-A-Bear sent me to St. Louis to participate in a 2-day blogger event. &nbsp;They put me up in a hotel and paid for transportation costs to allow me to attend. &nbsp;I also received products from Build-A-Bear as a thank you for attending the event. &nbsp;All opinions are 100% mine.</h6>

<p><a href="http://www.misikko.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2340" title="Picture 1" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Picture-13.png" alt="" width="211" height="58"></a>You know the ladies with the really frizzy hair back in the 80′s? &nbsp;Well, that is me. &nbsp;I have weird hair that can’t decide if it wants to be curly or straight and so it is just frizzy. &nbsp;I have battled it my whole life and at some point in the early 90′s embraced it. &nbsp;Sometimes I would perm my hair so that it would stay curly, and other times I would take an iron and have a friend iron it straight. &nbsp;In the past few years I have been using a flat iron to straighten it but with my thick course hair it takes a long time that frankly I don’t have time for everyday. &nbsp;It can really be a big pain, but you gotta do what you gotta do to be presentable (thus I wear my hair in a ponytail a lot). &nbsp;I recently had the opportunity to test a professional flat iron from <a href="http://www.misikko.com">Misikko</a>.</p>
<p>Misikko is a company that specializes in<a href="http://www.misikko.com/professional-hair-dryers.html"> professional hair dryers</a>, curling irons, hair care, skin care and <a href="http://www.misikko.com">the best flat irons</a> available on the market. &nbsp;They carry brands such as <a href="http://www.misikko.com/fachiceflir.html">Chi</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.misikko.com/t3-flat-iron.html">T3 Tourmaline</a> and <a href="http://www.misikko.com/hana-flat-iron.html">Hana Salon</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a little more about the company taken from their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Located outside of Philadelphia, a city known for its creative – but practical! – approach to high style, Misikko emerged from a desire we share with many of you: to easily shop and compare the best professional styling tools &amp; beauty products on the market. As beauty aficionados and savvy consumers, our goal is to help you learn about the tools of the trade so you can find the right salon tools &amp; products at the right prices – whenever &amp; wherever the mood strikes.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.misikko.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2341" title="Picture 3" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Picture-35-300x211.png" alt="" width="300" height="211"></a>Misikko sent us the <a href="http://www.misikko.com/hana-pink-flat-iron.html">Hana Professional Flat Iron 1″ Pink Edition</a> for me to review. &nbsp;I immediately loved it because it is PINK! &nbsp;A really pretty pink (I love pink)! Included with the flat iron is a Luxe Heat Proof Storage Pouch, Heat Proof Silicone Mat &nbsp;and Special Edition Tin Case. It was packaged so nicely that it would make a perfect gift for any lady in your life. &nbsp;Here are the features of the Hana Professional Flat Iron 1″ Pink Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stylish pink edition!</li>
<li>Advanced Tourmaline Ceramic Plates for Accelerated Ion Generation and Maximum Frizz-Free, Conditioning Shine</li>
<li>Ceramic is naturally hygienic, protects color &amp; retards fading</li>

<li>Flash Heats in Seconds with Instant Compensation for Heat Loss</li>
<li>Ergonomic Handle Design with No-Slip Grip</li>
<li>Smooth Grooves Keep Hair Strands Separate and Snag-Free</li>

<li>Includes Luxe Heat Proof Storage Pouch, Heat Proof Silicone Mat, &amp; Special Edition Tin Case</li>
<li>Two Year Warranty</li>
</ul>
<p>I have loved the experience of owning the Hana Flat Iron. &nbsp;This iron has cut my straighting time in half. &nbsp;It heats up to 450 degrees (allowing you to set the temperature) giving me straight hair with every stroke of the wand. &nbsp;My last straightener took me at least 2-3 times from root to end for the hair to be as straight as I wanted it to be (I just know I was really damaging my hair). Here is a picture of me before (I had a long day and wasn’t wearing any makeup so please excuse the photo):</p>

In the meantime, <a href="http://www.johnmorrell.com/">John Morrell</a> has just introduced allergen-free products that don’t contain ingredients that may trigger allergies such as milk, fish, soy, egg, nuts, and wheat. They are also gluten-free and free of MSG!</p>
<blockquote><p>About John Morrell<br>
Since 1827, John Morrell www.johnmorrell.com has provided consumers with high quality meats that satisfy both the nutritional and taste preferences of its customers. The company uses only the highest quality and freshest ingredients in its products, and maintains complete control over its entire production process, including its own supply sources. John Morrell offers more than 3,000 quality products, including fresh pork, bacon, boneless and bone-in hams, sausage specialties, hot dogs, lunchmeats and cooked beef items.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I love about these products from John Morrell is that you can have a cookout for friends and family using the allergen-free hot dogs and sausages and there is no need to worry if your guests have allergies or not.&nbsp; TJ is getting to the point of eating a bit of what my husband and I eat so I am also more willing for him to try John Morrell Allergen-Free Products than another brand that contains the allergy triggering ingredients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Morrell/101553883226665?v=app_129581203730472"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2325" title="smoked sausage[3]" src="http://amomsimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/smoked-sausage3-300x144.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="144"></a>We had the chance to try the Allergen-Free Smoked Sausage and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. &nbsp;It was just as good as a normal smoked sausage. &nbsp;There is so much that you can do with this product. We love chicken and sausage Jambalaya and the sausage was a fantastic addition to the dish. &nbsp;If you are looking for more recipes you can find them at <a href="http://www.johnmorrell.com/">JohnMorrell.com</a>.</p>
