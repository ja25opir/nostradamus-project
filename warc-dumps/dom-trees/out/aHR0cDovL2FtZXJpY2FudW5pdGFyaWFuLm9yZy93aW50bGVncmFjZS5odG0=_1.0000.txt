		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; color: black">The 
		final word. The last word. What can you say to sum up everything? I've 
		always been fascinated by what people chose to say when they know that 
		there is not much room for elaboration or explanation, and they want to 
		pack the greatest meaning into the fewest words. </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">What does a mother 
		say when her son is moving out of the house–going off to college, or to 
		seek his fortune in another part of the world? What did mothers say when 
		their sons went off to war? What word do fathers whisper to their 
		daughters at weddings just after that long walk down the aisle? (The 
		best I've heard is: "Remember—you can always come back home"!). And what 
		about the last words of a life, those final words on a death-bed, back 
		in the days when people died at home without tubes and machines keeping 
		them too doped-up to say anything? There was a book published not too 
		long ago of famous last words. I remember one where the great man closed 
		his eyes and said, "Ah, the light." Some thought he was seeing the light 
		of heaven of which so many have spoken; others thought he was 
		complaining that the room was too bright! </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">I thought about those 
		'great summations' as I prepared for this sermon on the benediction, the 
		last word of our worship. There are actually two parts to what is called 
		the "benediction" in our order of service. First are the words beginning 
		"Go forth into the world in peace," which liturgists would call "the 
		dismissal" (farewell, take care!). The second part is more properly a 
		"blessing" or a "grace." It is the latter that I want to talk about 
		today.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">We are a people of 
		The Story, the Bible, and it is no coincidence that my favorite 
		benediction is the same as the last words of the Bible, and, more 
		specifically, the fuller version of that blessing as given by St. Paul 
		at the close of his last letter to the rambunctious crowd of Christians 
		in the church in Corinth. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">What do they mean? 
		What does it mean when John, or Paul, or the Parson, says "The grace of 
		our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy 
		Spirit be with you"?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">I should tell you two 
		things at the beginning. First, that these words are not necessarily 
		Trinitarian. Oh sure, the familiar three are there—one can’t take 
		Christianity seriously without dealing with all three—but they are not 
		put together as one three-personed God. And as Unitarian minister 
		Wallace Robbins used to say: Grace, love and fellowship are NOT the 
		Trinity. Second—and this needs to be said—you don’t have to agree with 
		these words. They are not a creedal test, but a blessing, and a very 
		personal one. I will tell you that those "good words" are the fullest 
		prayer I can offer for you. They are my words, not necessarily your 
		words, my richest hope for you. They are also the most concise statement 
		of my faith, of what I believe with all my heart and soul.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">So what does it mean?</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-weight: bold">II</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">First, a definition:
		</span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		Grace is a free and unmerited gift from God that empowers us to live a 
		better life.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">The "free and 
		unmerited" part is important. Think about this: most religions, indeed 
		much of the world, is based on "merit"–you have to </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		earn</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%"> your way 
		into favor. Whether it is by performing certain rituals or learning some 
		secret knowledge, performing special deeds or achieving a level of 
		enlightenment, the idea is that YOU must rack-up the points in order to 
		be saved. In the secular world it is the idea of quid pro quo and 
		tit-for-tat and 'you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours'.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">In religious circles, 
		it is the idea that the church is a holy club, a gathering of the 
		saints. At its best, the Christian church has avoided that. Back in the 
		early years of Christianity, back when the Church was battling the 
		pagans, one of the great pagan philosophers (Celsus) noticed the 
		difference. “Those who summon people to the other mysteries (the other 
		religions),” he said, “make this preliminary proclamation: ‘(let him) 
		who has pure hands and a wise tongue’ come into the community, but the 
		Christians,” he continued, “say ‘whoever is a sinner, whoever is unwise, 
		whoever is a child, and, in a word, whoever is a wretch will be received 
		by the kingdom of God.’” [Pelikan, </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		Melody of Theology</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">, 
		p. 107] That’s quite a way to welcome new members!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">When the religious 
		community is like a holy club, you see, the question is: do you deserve 
		to be here? For the Christian, however, there is a different 
		understanding of human ability and, more importantly, of God's love. You 
		see, you cannot earn God's love. You don't have to strive until you 
		drop, you don't have to always be trying to prove that you're worthy of 
		being loved. You ARE loved, says the Christian. It is given, like the 
		love a mother gives to a child. I have always thought that that is the 
		reason why Christmas is such a powerful festival—for it reverses the 
		world's usual order of things, and presents the great irony of God's 
		power being in a vulnerable little child, and the exemplar is not the 
		great and mighty and powerful, but rather the uncompromising and even 
		uncomprehending love of a parent.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">So what is the gift, 
		the free and unmerited gift? It is, first of all, that child, and what 
		the Christ does to those who receive him.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%"> 
		is the fact that he came to us. HE is the gracious gift. The meaning of 
		calling the man Jesus "Christ" is to recognize the power of God's love 
		in human form, a love than is more than human. And the meaning of 
		calling him "Lord" is to be willing to be his subjects, his disciples.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">The gift of Christ is 
		not just that he taught us, with his words and with his life, but that 
		he is still with us empowering us to "go and do likewise." I think of 
		the people who care for those whom the world would rather forget—the 
		elderly, the disabled child, the AIDS victims. I think of those who bind 
		up wounded hearts, who tend to the poor, who feel an obligation to feed 
		empty stomachs and hungry souls. I think of those who go out of their 
		way in a crowd to greet one lonely person, who become peacemakers and 
		who hunger and thirst after righteousness. I think of those who endure 
		crucifixions of the spirit, and yet do not let love turn to indifference 
		or hate.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">Hemingway once 
		defined "courage" as "grace under pressure." I think it is also true 
		that grace enables courage under pressure—for that is what the grace of 
		Christ gives us: the power to be courageous for the good, in spite of 
		all the pressure to do otherwise. I </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		recognize</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%"> that 
		power because I've seen it in the Christ of the gospels, I </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		believe</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%"> that 
		power because I've seen it in others, and once in awhile, calling inside 
		me.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">The grace of our Lord 
		Jesus Christ.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		And the love of God? </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">It's almost 
		synonymous with the first. To believe in the love of God is to trust 
		that, finally, in the end, all will be as it should be. In the Book of 
		Revelation that "end" is "The End," the End of the World. But it is also 
		the trust that our struggles for the good in this world are </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		not</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%"> 
		meaningless, and that the right will, ultimately, prevail. How could you 
		do anything but merely exist, how could you even get out of bed in the 
		morning, without that trust? I had a friend who said that the greatest 
		act of faith is to believe that God is not mad, not insane, that the 
		whole universe is not some absurd spiraling chaos. He is right that it 
		IS a matter of faith, not of knowledge, that enables us to trust in the 
		future, but he has not identified the "greatest." The greatest act of 
		faith is to believe that the strongest force in the universe is 
		attraction, coming together, that is, love.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">For those who know 
		the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of Jesus Christ, the 
		evidence slowly mounts and the belief comes to the heart before it comes 
		to the head. We have been shown the love of God, and that gracious gift 
		empowers faith.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		And, lastly, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">. 
		The Holy Spirit is that unseen influence of God which works in 
		individuals and communities empowering us to do what we ought to do. It 
		is the power which, the Bible says, creates "love, joy, peace, patience, 
		kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control" 
		(Gal.5:6).</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">I think the holy 
		Spirit creates community among people. It creates churches. As 
		incomplete and unfinished as each one of us may feel in terms of our own 
		faith development, as unsure as we may be about what we believe, there 
		is something special that comes when we gather together. Paul Tillich 
		spoke of this as "the </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-style: italic">
		gestalt </span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">of 
		grace"—the fact that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
		Jesus put it differently: "When two or three of you gather in my name, I 
		will be there in the midst of you."</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">The gracious gift of 
		the Holy Spirit, you see, is "fellowship"—the fact that we are not 
		alone, by joining together in worship and life we give to each other 
		more than we could ever give alone. That is the last prayer and the last 
		benediction—that we might have the grace that empowers community, the 
		community in which Christ is present.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-kashida-space: 50%; margin: 15px 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 100%; font-weight: bold">III</span></p>
