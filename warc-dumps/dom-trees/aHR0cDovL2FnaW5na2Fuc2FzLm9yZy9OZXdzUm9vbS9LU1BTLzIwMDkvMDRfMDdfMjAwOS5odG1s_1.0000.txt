    <h3 align="center"><strong>Wonders of the wild</strong>: <strong>Turkey-hunting basics</strong></h3>
    <p><em>By Dan Lekie</em></p>
    <p>Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>This  is the first in a series by Dan Lekie, an  extension agent specializing in agriculture and natural resources with Johnson  County K-State Research and Extension.&nbsp;  Dan’s experience and expertise can guide seniors into the great outdoors  in an active way, season by season.</p>
    <p>The  spring turkey season is just around the corner. For many sportsmen and women, this  is a highlight of the year. Very few things can get your adrenaline pumping as  quickly as the gobble from an adult tom turkey.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Turkeys are normally harvested  with shotguns or archery equipment. Four species of wild turkeys live in the United States. Missouri has the eastern turkey  within its boundaries, and Kansas has the eastern turkey,  the Rio    Grande turkey, and a cross of the two. Rio Grande turkeys are located in  roughly the western two-thirds of the state, while the eastern turkey and Rio-eastern  hybrids are found in the eastern one-third.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  Kansas turkey season runs from  April 8 to May 31, while the shorter Missouri season is April 20 to  May 10. In Kansas, hunting hours are one-half  hour before sunrise to sunset, while the hours in Missouri are one-half hour  before sunrise to 1:00 p.m. Hunters may harvest up  to two toms or bearded hens per year. For detailed information regarding rules  and regulations, check with the state in which you are going to hunt. In Missouri, the following Web site  will provide all the pertinent information needed to hunt turkeys this spring:  mdc.mo.gov/hunt/turkey.&nbsp; The information  needed for Kansas can be found at ww.kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Hunting/Turkey.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Many  hunters prefer turkey hunting in the spring, during breeding season. That’s  when, by mimicking the sound of a female turkey, or hen, a hunter may attract a  male turkey, or tom, to harvest. Several types of calls can be used to attract  turkeys; they include mouth or diaphragm calls, paddle calls, slate, aluminum,  glass, wood, wing bone, and many other combinations. A bird may be harvested by  learning a single call of the hen turkey vocabulary, but most experienced  hunters use several call types and learn several hen turkey calls. At a  minimum, hen turkey calls to learn should include the yelp, cluck, putt, purr  and cackle. Numerous turkey-calling tapes are on the market to help novice and  expert alike perfect their calling techniques.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Wild  turkeys have excellent eyesight, making camouflage clothing a necessity. “Camo”  allows a hunter to blend in with the surrounding vegetation and makes the hunter’s  movements less easy to detect. Most hunters also wear gloves and face masks,  making them even harder to detect. Stores with hunting departments will have  several brands and styles of camouflage clothing available for purchase.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  biggest key to avoid being spotted by a turkey is to eliminate movement. Start  with a comfortable pad to sit on. Having a cushion between your backside and a  rock or a greenbriar vine drastically reduces your need to move. These cushions  are also available at stores with hunting departments.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If  you have yet to experience the thrill of a spring turkey hunt, why not give it  a try this year? One need not harvest a turkey to have a successful outing. Spending  time outside, enjoying the sights and sounds of nature, can be an enjoyable way  to rejuvenate from the stress of everyday living.</p>
    <p><strong>Spring outdoors—and the hunt</strong><br>
        <em>By&nbsp; Dan  Lekie</em></p>
    <p>I  wake up and look at the alarm clock. Four o’clock a.m., five minutes until the  alarm goes off and wakes the house. I shut it off and head for the living room.  Piled on the floor are 15 years of accumulated camouflage clothes, calls,  vests, hats, decoys, boots, and tons of miscellaneous stuff that any serious  outdoors person owns.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each  year, the opening of spring turkey season gets my energy pumping and offers me  the opportunity to experience the wonders of early-morning Kansas. I put on my outdated  camo clothes, grab my shotgun and shells, top off a huge mug of coffee, and  begin the hour-long drive to my favorite hunting spot. On the drive I pop in a  tape of turkey calls so I can be ready to go when I get to my spot.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  dirt road in front of me explodes with whippoorwills fleeing my headlights as I  approach my destination. As I finish loading my turkey vest with a few more  calls and a bottle of water, a coyote howls in the distance. Three more join in  and then an owl hoots in the woods behind me. A turkey answers this commotion  with a thunderous gobble. A huge smile crosses my face, hidden by the face mask  hanging from my hat. This is what turkey hunting is really about: enjoying all  the sights and sounds Mother Nature provides during these early-morning outings.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I  head to a spot about 75 yards from the gobbling bird, quickly set out a decoy  in a small opening in the timber, and slide into cover about 25 yards from the  decoy. I sit quietly for about 10 minutes and then make a few very soft yelps  on my slate call. There is an instant response from the gobbler. Ten minutes  later, another soft call and an immediate response. Everything is perfect! The  legal shooting time has arrived and I hear the gobbler fly down. I make another  soft call and the tom responds with a somewhat muffled gobble. I wait. A flock  of honking Canada geese passes overhead. A  cow begins bawling in the distance and is joined by another. I wait.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I  view two hen turkeys walking away from the opening. This is not good. I make a  call. No answer. I wait. A coyote runs up to my decoy and sniffs it. He almost  jumps out of his skin when I wave my arm to move him along. I make a call. No  response. Two deer walk out of the woods and begin feeding toward me. They are  joined by three more, and a crow decides it’s time to start calling from a  nearby tree. Male cardinals and a chickadee begin their nonstop chatter in  search of companionship. I make a call. No response. I wait. I continue this  sequence for a little more than three hours without successfully bagging a tom.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It’s  time to call it quits. I need to get back home and then to work. I stand up and  look in the direction from which the tom had been calling. There he is, in all his  majestic beauty. His head is a brilliant white, bordered with blue and bright  red. He’s an old bird with a beard dragging the ground, and he has a harem of  six hens. That explains what has happened. It can be difficult to call a tom  away from hens.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I  head to the truck and begin my trek home. Was this day a disappointment because  I had not bagged a tom? Absolutely not. The experiences I encounter while  pursuing game are a huge source of enjoyment for me. As I get older, I find  myself enjoying these encounters with nature almost as much as I enjoy the  hunt. I would not be surprised, in a few years, to find that I enjoy them even  more.</p>

    <h3>Grandparents  as Parents: To  sleep or not to sleep …</h3>
    <p><em>By Shirley Carson</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>Wait,  what was the question?</p>
    <p>We are all  familiar with statistics illuminating the sleep deprivation typical of our  society. A significant number of traffic accidents result from fatigue, the  quality of innumerable work hours is compromised as employees struggle with  waning energy levels, our physical resilience is diminished by lack of rest — and  yet we persist in our determination to suck the life out of every last second  of the day. Our fast-paced, stressful lives rob us of desperately needed sleep,  and eventually we — and our families — pay the price. Those of us who are raising  our grandchildren know this all too well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>From infancy to  adulthood, there are marked changes in how much sleep people need, the amount of  time spent in each stage of sleep, and how easily they fall asleep and stay  asleep (a factor scientists call “sleep efficiency”). Infants need from 16 to  18 hours of sleep, babies and toddlers need 12 to 14 hours, preschoolers need  10 to 12, and both elementary students and teens need a minimum of nine hours.  Adults typically need 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 hours of uninterrupted sleep.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The real agony of  sleep deprivation emerges in adolescence. As kids go through puberty, two  things happen to make sleep problematic: They need more sleep than prepubescent  children, yet their body clocks shift to later sleep and later wakening. Sleep  deprivation has been linked to poor grades, moodiness and depression. Ronald  E. Dahl, a sleep expert at the University   of Pittsburgh, says sleep  deprivation among teenagers creates a “negative spiral” of fatigue, emotional instability,  poor decision-making and risky behavior.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For those of us  caring for children, the negative health consequences to inadequate sleep  include high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, weight gain, diabetes and  depression. So it’s important to get ourselves and the grandkids to bed early.<br>
    </p>
    <p>According to  sleep experts, with a sufficient amount of sleep we will wake in the morning  without an alarm clock. Constantly pressing the snooze alarm may indicate a  problem — not with strength of will or self-discipline, but with your sleep.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Simple choices  can be made to improve your slumber. One of the first is steering clear of  caffeine, a daily vice in which many of us indulge to counteract fatigue.  Drinking coffee, sodas and caffeinated teas throughout the day can cause the  very problems we are drinking to solve. Caffeine intake, particularly in the  evening, delays sleep and increases the tendency to waken during the night.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Just as with the  children, a regular bedtime routine, such as a cup of herbal tea an hour before  bed, will mentally ease your transition from the busyness of the day into a  sound night’s sleep. Reading  relaxing books or magazines can be helpful, but television sets should be off  at bedtime.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Do not skimp on  nighttime comfort! Maintain a pleasant temperature in your bedroom, and create  a soothing environment. Mask troublesome noises with a white-noise generator.  If you wake at night, don’t fret that you are not asleep. Avoid watching the  clock, which can cause anxiety. If you are awake for more than 30 minutes,  leave your bed and do something boring in dim light until sleepiness returns.  Then give it another go. Curl up under the covers, breathe deeply, and sink  into sleep.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you can’t  fall asleep within 30 minutes of lying down, if you have excessive daytime  sleepiness, or if you sleep for seven or more hours and still wake up tired,  you may have a sleep disorder. See your doctor, who may recommend an overnight  sleep study. People with disorders such as sleep apnea are at higher risk for  stroke and transient ischemic attacks (“mini-strokes”), coronary heart disease,  heart failure, irregular heartbeat, heart attack and high blood pressure.  Although there is no cure for sleep apnea, successful treatment can reduce the  risk.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Chronic sleep  deprivation, for whatever reason it occurs, is a valid concern. It can harm  your health and negatively affect your parenting. As we care for our grandkids,  making sure they get plenty of sleep, let’s not neglect our own sleep needs.</p>
    <p><em>Shirley Carson, RN, is  a retired nurse and grandmother. Since raising her three oldest grandchildren,  her desire is to encourage others who are parenting their grandchildren. She  lives in </em><em>Olathe</em><em>, </em><em>Kan.</em></p>

    <h3 align="center"><strong>Kitchen-table money talk: Blue-light special at the </strong><strong>IRS</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
    <p><em>By Gene Meyer</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>Your  chances for a more tax-free retirement took a big leap upward this year, thanks  to some of those bailout packages that Washington has been passing by the  shovelful lately. Briefly, here’s why, according to financial planners:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Four  years ago, Congress passed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act  of 2005, allowing taxpayers <em>in 2010</em> to convert their traditional tax-deferred individual retirement accounts  (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and small-business SIMPLE and SEP IRAs into<strong> Roth IRAs. </strong>Roth money is tax free when  you pull it out; money from the other accounts is taxed as ordinary income, the  same as a paycheck.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  2010 window is a one-time deal. Taxpayers in 2009, or in 2011 and beyond, may  convert their accounts to Roth IRAs only if their incomes do not exceed $100,000.  And everyone who converts will feel a tax bite when switching from a  traditional account to a Roth. (Uncle Sam still wants a cut from the sheltered  money somewhere along the line.) But if you make the conversion in 2010, you  can spread those taxes over the two subsequent years, 2011 and 2012, notes  Christine Benz, personal finance director at Morningstar, Inc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Recently  the deal got sweeter. Just before Christmas, Congress passed more tax  legislation — the Worker, Retiree and Employee Recovery Act of 2008 — which  temporarily halts, for 2009 only, the requirement that account owners older  than 70 ½ years withdraw and pay taxes on part of their retirement savings each  year. The 2008 law also makes it easier for children, charities and other  beneficiaries other than widows or widowers to keep money in an inherited  tax-deferred plan longer if they choose.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Cut  through the tax jargon and you discover that the difference is huge, says Ed  Slott, author, IRA maven and host of the “Stay Rich for Life” specials on  public television. Waiving the required minimum distribution for a year cuts  your chances of being bumped into a higher tax bracket when the extra cash hits  your income stream.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Also,  nearly all our retirement accounts have taken hits since the stock markets began  tanking last autumn. That hurts, of course. But there is a bright side for  anyone thinking of converting retirement plans to Roths. The potential tax bite  when you convert is smaller if, say, 25 percent of your previous balance is  gone — and the money you earn afterward, when markets presumably recover, will be  tax free.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And  tax-free income won’t be anything to dismiss lightly in the next several years,  Slott said during a Web seminar in February while multibillion- and trillion-dollar  relief bills were zipping through Washington, D.C. Political promises to  the contrary, Slott said, “I believe tax rates will go through the roof with  these bailouts.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>So,  how good a deal is converting? You’ll need to push a pencil around your own  numbers and probably talk with a trusted tax professional to decide for sure.  In the meantime, there are some potential falling sandbags to watch for as you  do the math:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> One is that one-time windows of opportunity like this eventually slam shut. Specifically,  in this case, income limits on who can and cannot contribute to Roth IRAs  presumably will kick in again after 2010. You will want to be reasonably sure you  can still make future contributions if you want to when that happens, said  Morningstar’s Benz.</li>
      <li> You also should be sure you have resources outside your retirement plan with  which to pay the taxes you will owe at conversion. Otherwise, if you are  younger than 59 ½ and don’t convert dollar-for-dollar into a Roth, you will owe  additional 10-percent penalties on any money you keep out to help with the  taxes.</li>
      <li> Finally, look at <em>all </em>the potential  tax consequences that converting might trigger. Even if an extra five- or  six-figure shot into your income stream won’t disqualify you from opening a  Roth in 2010, you will want to know whether the extra money might bump you into  a higher bracket for the year or potentially wipe out credits, deductions and  other breaks you want.<br>
        “Remember,  this is all about <em>controlling</em> taxes,”  Slott told his seminar listeners. “You can always get money back from the  market, but if you lose it to taxes, it’s gone forever.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Gene  Meyer, a Fairway resident and&nbsp;former staff reporter at</em>&nbsp;The Wall Street  Journal <em>and</em> The Kansas City Star, <em>reports and writes about&nbsp;financial  topics at <a href="http://kitchentablenomics.blogspot.com/">www.kitchentablenomics.com/</a>.</em></p>
    <h3>Should  you convert your IRA to a Roth?</h3>
    <p><em>By Gene Meyer</em></p>
    <p>Your biggest barrier is apt to be the tax hit. When  you convert a traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) savings plan into a  Roth IRA, you will owe taxes on all the contributions you or your employer  previously deducted and any investment profits that haven’t been taxed so far.  You may convert just part of the plan if that seems more affordable.</p>
    <p>Converting may increase your taxable income  dramatically and push you into a higher bracket for the year you make the  switch. The extra money also may threaten some exemptions and credits for which  you now qualify.</p>
    <p>Future tax rates are impossible to predict. But  conversion makes sense if you think your future rates will be the same or  higher than now.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Roth owners  are not required to pull money out of their plan at 70 ½&nbsp; years of age, which gives them more  flexibility for saving and investing than traditional plans offer.</p>
    <p><strong>For more tax help</strong><br>
        <em>By Gene Meyer</em></p>
    <p>Your  own tax professional, if you use one, is a good adviser on conversion questions  because he or she knows the most about your situation. Other options:</p>
