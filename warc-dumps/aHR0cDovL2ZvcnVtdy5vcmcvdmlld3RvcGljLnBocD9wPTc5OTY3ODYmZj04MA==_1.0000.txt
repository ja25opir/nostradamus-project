As users download needs change here at forumw.org we strive to accommodate those needs. Following requests by members and a increasing demand we are proud to announce the NEW HD MOVIES SUBFORUM! Whether your currently looking for HD content, or going to be looking for HD content in the future we feel this forum will help you with finding what your looking for quickly and conveniently.

http://forumw.org/viewforum.php?f=93



With this new subforum a special set of posting rules is set in-place to help both uploaders and downloaders alike.

1) The topic title must include: The Movie title, it's Release Group, the Video & Audio Codec used with 720p/1080p info

2) Included in post must have Screenshots, language & the Audio & Video codecs used along with the bitrates
-720p must have a minimum bitrate of 4000 kbps
-1080p must have a minimum bitrate of 8000 kbps

3) Passwords for all archived files, if needed, must be provided and stated clearly within the original post
-Posts with Surveys for Password or Fake posts will be removed and member banned


We are asking members to help us streamline this new forum area by reporting posts in the "Movies" area that should be moved to the HD Movies subforum, and respectively any posts in the HD Movies subforum that should be moved to the normal movies forum area.


Thank you to all the members for your input and we hope you enjoy this new forum area.

Aye.

Its something we've been wanted to do but time and manpower hasn't been right. We had a lengthy debate on it, and finally we went about getting things in order. Seahawk, the admins, the supers, and the mods all did an excellent job with getting things going.

Now if everyone plays nice with the new forum area we'll see about another surprise. ;)
