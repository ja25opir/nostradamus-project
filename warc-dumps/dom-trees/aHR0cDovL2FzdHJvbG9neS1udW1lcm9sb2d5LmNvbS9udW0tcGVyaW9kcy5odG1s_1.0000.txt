PATH PERIODS</font></b></dt>

      </dl>

      <dl>

        <dt>The <a href="num-lifepath.html">life
path</a> has been discussed in very elementary details
previously, and the life path period is an addition to this reading
that should be taken into account. If we live long enough, we will
experience three life path periods. As you progress into this page,
think of the readings in terms of a modification or enhancement
personalizing the life path reading. These readings do not replace the
life path reading, but merely fine tune and customize it to the
individual. Because life path periods can vary so widely, the life path
we are on becomes complex and motley. </dt>

      </dl>

      <p>The life periods are based on the birth date. The number
representing the month of birth, reduced to a single digit or master
number, is the first life path period indicator. The second life path
period is determined by the day of birth reduced to a single digit or
master number. The final period is based on the year of birth reduced
to a single digit or master number.</p>

      <p>The timing of the first period begins at birth and
continues until at least when in astrological progression the Moon has
returned to its original place in the birth chart. This is about 28
years. To estimate the completion of the first period, determine the
year that the subject turns 28. Next, calculate the <a href="num-personalyear.html">personal year</a> for the
subject that year. If it is a 1 personal year, this year should be
considered the beginning of the second life path period. If it is a 2
personal year for the subject, the previous year should be considered
the beginning of the second life path period. If it is a 3-9 personal
year, the beginning of the second life path period will not occur until
the beginning of the next nine year cycle, i.e. the next 1 personal
year.</p>

      <p>This same process should be used to determine the
beginning of the third life path period. For this, it is the 1 personal
year a year before, on, or after, the 56th birthday.</p>

      <p><b>For example</b>, my birth is month 2, day
8, year 1939/22. Thus, I would be 28 in 1967 (1939+28-1967) which would
be a 6 personal year for me. The next, 1968 would be 7 personal year;
1969 an 8 personal year, and 1970 a 9 personal year. The year 1971
would be my next 1 personal year making this the year that my life path
period changed to 8. In 1995, a 7 personal year for me, I turned 56. My
next number 1 personal year came in 1998. This then was the beginning
of my third life path period.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p><b>1 Life Path Period</b><a name="Life Path Period 1"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> In this period you will
show a stronger tendency toward independence. Originality and
creativity come early and continue through this period. You have the
ability to lead early on, but at a time when the emphasis is on
learning to follow, this can be a problem. You do have a good deal of
early self-confidence and individuality which can help you achieve
early successes. You are aggressive in your early career path.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years:</b> In this period you
will have more drive and determination thanks to the 1 life path
period. If you have other indicators that you would do well in business
for yourself, this life path period would be time to move in that
direction. Your demeanor now is highly independent and leadership
skills are sharpened. The potential pitfalls here are letting ego go a
little out of control and perhaps showing a lack of patience at times.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> New challenges may
continue to appear even in your later years. In this period you may
achieve the recognition that eluded you earlier, and this may mean it
will be hard to kick back and take life easy. A 1 life path period does
not lend itself to early retirement and leisure activities. Indeed,
this may become the most active time of your life.</p>

      <p><b>2 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 2"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> This is a difficult life
path period for a young child since it suggests that emotions may run
high and sensitivities to many things may be present. On the positive
side, this influence may be helpful for developing any artistic
talents. The 2 period may be one in which you will be required to be
helpful, supportive, and willing to adapt in general. A tendency to
have emotional reactions to problems and confrontation may follow you
into early adulthood.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years: </b>The 2 lifepath
period suggests that you will profit from your ability to work together
with others in harmony and cooperation. In these years your ability to
use skills in diplomacy and mediation will be pronounced. The affairs
of others and their success may be the key to your own advancement.
Pushing your own agenda doesn't work as well now. The need is to
control hyperactive emotions that may appear from time to time.</p>

      <p><b>Later years: </b>The 2 lifepath period
in the later years promises a good retirement with many friends and
opportunities. Your influence now will be based on your ability to
bring together diverse opinions and ideas. Friends and family, and
especially a close relationship is all important to your happiness now.
Having close connections is vital to your health and wellbeing in your
senior years.</p>

      <p><b>3 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 3"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> The 3 is an excellent
lifepath period for a young person because of its inclination toward
the development of expression. Any talents you may have in creative or
artistic endeavors are encouraged during this period. Emotions may be
high and hyperactive tendencies can be present. Making friends and
enjoying social interactions will come easily now. Enjoy life as this
is the tone of the 3 period, but be careful not to scatter your
activities to the point that you fail to make progress on anything.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years:</b> This is likely to
be a very pleasant, carefree and creative time in your life. Being
original and using your talents of expression will find you furthering
your career and your life in general. If there is a pitfall during this
time it is becoming overly optimistic and extravagant, and spreading
your talents too thin. In all this is a period that offers much
happiness in exchange for a minimum of planning and concentration.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> A 3 period in later life
suggests an active social life with numerous hobbies and activities. If
you are a creative person, this late life period may become your most
prolific and fruitful. Indeed, this may be the time to write that book
you have thought about, a time to learn a new method of expression
perhaps, or simply let your imagination run free. Enjoy yourself, it
won't be that terribly hard now.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>4 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 4"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years: </b>A 4 life path period is
not much fun for a young person. It suggests that learning is difficult
or the demands placed upon you to learn were harsh and burdensome. Now
you have to build a solid foundation and the tone is one of learning
practicality, order, and routine. Often this period denotes growing up
with limited resources or restrictions of some sort. The demands often
set the stage for later successes. You are to be very well prepared to
start your career in early adulthood.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years:</b> This period is a
time to build and develop ideas into a tactile form. Now is a time that
you become more of a builder, a better organizer, and perhaps even a
more stable and secure person. Your judgment and decisions take on more
conservatism and practicality, and they are based on careful and more
thoughtful planning. You are apt to be more serious about your work and
perhaps devote more time to it, too. Be careful not to become a
workaholic. With a 4 lifepath period you must be constantly reminded to

take the time to smell the roses.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> The 4 period in the
later years suggests a period that predicts work rather than
retirement. Whether by choice or by necessity, you are apt to keep your
nose to the grindstone a lot longer than most of your peers. Even if
you do retire, you will want to keep working on hobbies and avocation
long after others have opted for the rocking chair. If you own your own
business, it may be hard to accept that fact that things can run
without your ever present attention.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>5 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 5"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> The 5 period early in
life can be difficult because it often lacks the stability and
certainty that you may wish for. This period often features changes and
emphases freedom of thought and activity. You are likely to be
constantly looking for something new, something exciting, something
less boring to stimulate your expansive mind. During this time you will
be an explorer and a wanderer. Whether this is a positive or a negative
trait only time will tell. At any rate you are driven by curiosity and
adventure. A restless nature often results, and as you progress into
adulthood, a number of job or career changes may occur.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years:</b> In this period you
are ever ready to accept change, progress, and new ideas. Likewise you
are quick, some times too quick, to dump the old, old jobs, old
activities, even old relationships. Sometimes this is good, sometime
not so good. At any rate this 5 period suggests that you are more
impulsive now and the test will be to see if you can handle the
increased freedom you are feeling with constructive judgment. If so,
you will find this is a period that can and should produce remarkable
results.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> With the 5 period
occurring late in life, be prepared for a never ending series of
adventures and expansive travel so long as the resources hold out.
Actually, however, many with a late life 5 period choose to continue to
work because of the sense of freedom found in their endeavors now; so
long as the work is not boring or routine, there may be no reason to
quit. This influence will continue to send you off to find new
challenges and try new things. You are never too old to learn.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>6 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 6"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> The 6 period produces a
need to be needed, and you probably want to help your parents or your
brothers, sisters, and friends in whatever way you can. In some cases,
this period is one in which the subject is required or somehow forced
to take on more than a normal amount of responsibility at an early age.
Generally, this early time in the life is marked by obvious attempts to
be helpful and even nurturing to others. In early adulthood there is a
strong sense of responsibility and caring.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years:</b> Through these years
you will find yourself getting ahead only after you have made the
personal sacrifices necessary to benefit others in need. Much of your
life in this period will tend to be centered around your home and
family. This is not a period that lends itself to dramatic enrichment
because you tend to be more selfless and less demanding of personal
rewards. Your opportunities may be as an idealist, a mediator, and
perhaps even a leader in your community. Certainly the focus of the
period is associated with family and domestic concerns.</p>

      <p><b>Later years: </b>The 6 period late in
life is usually a happy and content time. It denotes a tendency to
accept responsibility and lend a helping hand to those around you. You
are not likely to be lonely in your later years since family and
domestic matters will probably be emphasized during this time. Indeed,
you may help or even be responsible for rearing a grandchild or two.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>7 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 7"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years: </b>If there is a problem
with the 7 period in early life it is being misunderstood or considered
"difficult." In this period you may have the sense that you are
different from your peers. You repel conformity. The 7 period makes you
inclined to seek and absorb learning as a primary focus. The fact that
you don't feel very comfortable in your environment is to be expected.
Your natural curiosity and inquisitive mind will take you far during
this period.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years: </b>The 7 period in
the productive years is excellent for one continuing studies and
analysis into mid life. The tendency is to strive for mental growth and
development and you are apt to be in the process of expanding your
areas of interest now. This period is a plus if you are engaged in
academic pursuits, but otherwise progress may be slow. It is hard to
force yourself to seek opportunity now, and if you do, it will probably
be to no avail. Perhaps it will come to you if you get prepared.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> When the 7 period occurs
in later life you may find yourself engaged in study as never before in
your life. This period may find you writing more, engaged in some form
of research, or venturing into new and interesting subjects. This is
not a very social period and indeed there is concern that you may
become increasingly isolated by your own choosing.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>8 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 8"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> An 8 period in early
life stresses the practical and the material. This is not the stuff of
a good childhood experience as it may tend to elevate the importance of
material success at an inappropriate age. For the less affluent, there
may be too much interest in achieving material goals. This period may
have its positive side in preparing a relatively young person for
financial and material success. You may go into business early in life
with the tools to succeed.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years: </b>The 8 lifepath
period in the productive years may push you to a level of success that
would not have otherwise been attained. This period denotes a time when
attainment, authority, and general business acumen is brought to
foreground. You will want to set your goals high and do everything in a
big way. If you have the inherent management abilities, this period
will accelerate your prestige and attainments.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> With the 8 lifepath
period in later life, it is suggested that your greatest achievements
may be yet to come. If all you have lacked before is good management,
now may be your time to shine. In retirement you may find yourself
deeply involved in clubs, organizations and perhaps government
entities. Your contribution to these can be important for your sense of
accomplishment and for your social life at this time.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>9 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 9"></a></p>

      <p>Early years: The 9 lifepath is difficult for a young
person because so much is expected of them in terms of feeling
compassion and tolerance. The youthful years are by nature selfish
years and the 9 period stifles this sense of being self absorbed. While
the upbringing under this influence can be helpful in the future, often
the period brings periods of feeling lonely, unappreciated and unsure
of self. The lesson of the 9 is that life is universal rather than
personal, and thus, those with this early path may have a head start.<br>

      <br>

      <b>Productive years:</b> With the 9 in the productive
years you may find yourself becoming more of a humanitarian. You may
find it easier to express compassion, sympathy, understanding and
tolerance while in this period. This can be an emotional cycle and one
of significant personal growth. You may be called on to overcome
disappointments and setbacks, but the potential for gain in this period
is significant.</p>

      <p><b>Later years:</b> The 9 period in the
later years generally signifies a settled and happy life at this
juncture. You are inclined to positive feelings toward the world, and
you will want to share your experiences to a greater extent. You may
engage in many positive works benefiting mankind or just a few needy
souls in your immediate environment. The lesson of the number is
learning to give without expecting to get something back. If you have
learned this by this time, this period may well be the best part of
your life.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>11 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 11"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years:</b> This master number is
generally not attainable by a very young person and it is usually best
to consider this a 2 lifepath period early on. As a young adult, you
may find yourself drawn toward spiritual matters and idealism. Indeed,
in this period you are inclined to act as an idealist, perhaps studying
religion, metaphysics, or philosophy. Modest goals during this period
will serve you best, as being too aggressive will result in problems
with stress and nerves.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years:</b> In the productive
years the 11 lifepath period will serve you best in any spiritual
pursuit, but you may find yourself being a little out of touch with the
business world. If your life has been a material one up to now, this
period may cause some redirection. If you have inclinations to teach,
to heal, to uplift, this is period when these lofty goals can come to
fruit. This period can be a hard one if you find yourself under
pressure and stress. Nervous tension can be a periodic problem.</p>

      <p><b>Later years: </b>In retirement or at
least the later years, the 11 lifepath period may direct you toward a
more spiritual conclusion. In these years you will be able to find more
time for study and reflection, expanding your mind and broadening your
thinking. This redirection may push you into a more spiritual way of
thinking and definitely away from the material side of life. For some
who reject the idea of spiritualism, the "Later years 2" reading may be
more definitive.</p>

      <p><b>22 Life Path Period</b><a name="Lifepath Period 22"></a></p>

      <p><b>Early years: </b>There is no early 22
lifepath period since there is no 22 month.</p>

      <p><b>Productive years: </b>The 22 period
during the productive years can send you sailing up the ladder. If you
are properly prepared and adequately equipped, this period may find you
being placed in charge of big projects, accomplishing huge
achievements, and functioning or striving for a spot at the top of the
heap. The number 22 is the master builder. Having the period doesn't
necessarily make you a master builder, but it does produce the flow of
events that will certainly speed you on the road to success. This is a
time to follow your hunches as you assume greater responsibility and
capitalize on opportunities. Keep nerves and emotions under control as
these can be a problem during this period.</p>

      <p><b>Later years: </b>Many with the 22 period
in later life never do retire or if they do, that retirement is never
one that is complete leisure. Nervous energy may keep you on the go.
This period may well be your most accomplished as events of the time
may indeed set you up for big projects and major achievements. Keep
occupied in these years and don't shy away from the main stage of life.<br>
