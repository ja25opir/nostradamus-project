						<h3><a href="jun04-bigsale-p.html"><img src="../../../images/buttons/but-print-3.gif" alt="" height="27" width="100" align="right" border="0"></a>The Big Sale</h3>
						<p><span class="author"><font color="navy">By Gordon Powers</font></span></p>
						<p>For the eBay generation, acquiring used goods is about as difficult as making toast. Unfortunately, buying or selling a practice, or a book of business, or even part of one for that matter, is a transaction fraught with challenges that you don’t face when the only thing changing hands is a used hockey sweater.</p>
						<p>If you’re finding it increasingly difficult to acquire clients one at a time, or if you’ve built up economies of scale in your business and it therefore makes sense to take on large numbers of clients at a time, acquiring a book of business can be an attractive option.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Until recently, the principal motivation for selling a business has been disenchanted advisors’ desire for a career change, not retirement, suggests David Grau, president of Business Transitions Inc., a Portland, Oregon-based firm that helps advisors sell their books.</p>
						<p>Over the past few years, many would-be sellers put retirement plans on hold – either because of the slipping value of their practices or because they were reluctant to abandon long-standing clients in the midst of a market downturn. But, as markets rebound, things have been picking up.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“When it comes to selling a practice, we've learned that quick decisions to sell are now the rule, not the exception,” says Grau. “In fact, most financial advisors decide to sell and implement that decision in less than 12 months.”</p>
						<p>The bottom line is that you don't want to surprise your clients one day by suddenly implementing a succession or transition plan, Grau says. Ultimately, your business’s value depends on how well your clients accept your successor and transition plan. And while it may be hard to tell them now, it will only get that much harder the longer you wait, he maintains. “If you're a one-principal firm, I guarantee that your clients are thinking about this issue, too.”&nbsp;</p>
						<p>On the other side of the transaction, the motivations are equally straightforward. Apart from obtaining fast growth, most buyers, including Ian Whiting of Burnaby, B.C.-based Ad Astra Financial Planning Group Ltd., are looking to expand or upgrade their business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Whiting, a 25-year veteran of the financial planning business, decided several years ago that the most effective way to expand was through acquisition. He has bought six practices within the last few years and says the independent 14-advisor firm anticipates buying more.</p>
						<p>Advisors usually begin the process of buying or selling in a rather mundane way – probing business acquaintances, friends, and family members as well as accountants and lawyers – for names of firms interested in moving their practices. Whiting learned about a couple of his purchases through a fund wholesaler and through conversations at industry meetings and conferences. As well, he’s taken on a group of clients from a long-standing acquaintance that has recently become disabled.</p>
						<p>Several transactions later, Whiting feels he’s a more discerning buyer than he once was. Before he agrees to acquire a business, he puts each book and the outgoing advisor through a rigorous due diligence. Warning signs include letters of complaint from clients that were sent to the securities commission or other regulatory bodies.</p>
						<p>It is quite normal to find “red flags” in the due diligence process because every business is going to have its weak points, Whiting says. “As the buyer, your job is to determine what those weak points are, how you’re going to handle them after the acquisition, and determine the impact of these points in the final price.”</p>
						<p>Sometimes it’s what’s not there that concerns him. “We’ll look for files that really don’t have anything in them,” he says. “That either means that they’ve not been looked after properly or that someone has been fooling with them. You want to make sure there aren’t any potential liabilities,” he says, noting that it's good business sense to maintain errors and omissions coverage on the outgoing advisor for at least three years.</p>
						<p>These investigations can make for an awkward situation, he admits, since buyers want to find out as much as they can, while sellers need to protect the confidentiality of client information – especially if they're negotiating with a competitor. “But, since most of what you’re buying is goodwill, you’d be crazy not to push things,” he maintains.</p>
						<p>There's also the question of whether or not to sell a practice to a key employee or associate. About 44 per cent of advisors plan to make such an inside sale, according to Cerulli Associates, a market research firm in Boston. The inside transaction is even more common at bigger firms: 60 per cent of practices with six or more employees figure they'll make an internal sale, while 37 per cent of firms with one or two employees plan to do so, they report.</p>
						<p>David Chalmers, a long-time advisor with The Rogers Group in Vancouver, is one of those. Chalmers has been a seller twice now, each time bringing in a younger associate and slowly turning over clients to him. “People are not chattels. I know I’m in the minority here, but you can’t turn clients over to just anyone,” he says. “And why would they want to pay for them if you hold them in such low regard?”&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Chalmers warns younger advisors to avoid paying too high a price unless the seller is going to be intimately involved with the business for a lengthy period of time. “Due diligence is crucial,” he says. “Interview the seller to find out how they run their business and what kinds of relationships they’re prepared to maintain with their clients.” Oddly enough, you actually do want them around – if only for a short space of time, he adds.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Hence, over a three-year period, then new associate Cory Hill sat in on most of Chalmers’ client meetings, slowly acquiring a portion of the overall client base through a natural evolution. “It was quite seamless actually, although my actively overseeing the process likely made it easier for both of us,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The hardest part of the acquisition process may be figuring out whether buyer and seller are cut from the same cloth. That means making sure you share everything from your investment philosophy and approach to client service to how you charge for your services.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>With an increasing number of advisors turning to fee-based planning, it’s important to make sure you’re acquiring assets that will blend in with your business model, Chalmers says. “Fee-related income definitely boosts the value of a practice, but only if buyers can look after these types of clients.”</p>
						<p>It’s really all about fit. Whiting, for example, decided against doing a deal with one potential seller, in part because the firm felt the advisor was too restrictive in how clients would be contacted and that he may have dropped the ball on other service issues.</p>
						<p>“It’s not that we couldn’t do better, it’s just that we felt we’d have to deal with a bunch of disgruntled clients who’d take a lot of time to come around,” he says. “You always expect some drop off, and we normally cull some clients anyway, but we’re looking to recoup our investment in a year and that wasn’t going to happen.”&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It’s important to calculate the sustainability of the assets, says Rayner McCullough, a now-retired advisor in Barrie, Ontario who went through several potential partners, including his own son, before finally selling out to local advisor Shirley Sawyer over a period of several years. “I can honestly say that Shirley’s kept just about every client I ever had,” says McCullough, who still maintains an office on site even though he’s no longer active in the business. “But I suspect that’s really quite unusual.”&nbsp;</p>
						<p>McCullough’s advice to younger advisors looking for a similar deal is to gauge how “persistent” the business lines are. Group insurance is renewed annually, as opposed to accident and sickness policies, which have a high persistency rate, he explains. Similarly, term life policies renew at periodic intervals and, each time they come up for renewal, the buyer is in jeopardy of losing the business.</p>
						<p>If you are looking to slow down, consider selling the smaller, less productive part of your client base separately and in advance, Whiting suggests. If you've been around the business for 10 years or more, your lower-end clients may well be the top- or at least mid-level clients for an up-and-coming local practitioner, he suggests. As a potential seller, you will not only make the rest of your practice more valuable and profitable, you'll also gain some valuable experience in the selling and client transition process.</p>
						<p>And finally, don’t underestimate the sense of loss you’re likely to feel, warns McCullough. “For a lot of us, saying goodbye to the business – and, more importantly, the clients – is an emotional challenge. A few of the advisors I know aren’t ready to handle it, although I’m not sure they know that.”</p>
						<p>For McCullough, the solution has been to stay involved as a goodwill ambassador for the firm, spending a couple of hours each day at the office. However, he’s quick to acknowledge that this may not be a workable strategy for most advisors.</p>
						<p>“These folks put up with me hanging around and it seems to work for us,” he laughs. “But I’m not so sure I’d want to see me here every day if positions were reversed.”</p>

											<h4>A Fair Price</h4>
										</div>
										<p>“Today's buyers are looking for profitable practices, not just assets under management,” says Sandra Foster, a Toronto-based consultant and author of Buying and Selling a Book of Business: What Every Financial Advisor and Planner Should Know. And that means factoring in client retention and the cost of running the business as well.</p>
										<p>Although fit is crucial in any union, you need a common starting point as you begin to calculate a fair price, she says. This means using and perhaps combining several different methods, she suggests, including: assets under management; the number and average age of clients, the quality of the client assets, average account size, historical commission and fee income; annual recurring revenues; an estimate of what you will actually earn; and the business's bottom-line profitability, or free cash flow.</p>
										<p>Depending on which method you choose, you'll need to apply a multiple or factor to it. As a general guideline, says Foster, the factor for an AUM (assets under management)&nbsp; transaction is roughly 0.5, whereas annually recurring revenues might warrant a factor of 2, with bottom-line profitability being worth three times as much. A practice with a free cash flow of $100,000, for example, might then be worth $300,000. If you calculated a practice's value based on historical commission income of $250,000, the price would be roughly $250,000, she suggests.&nbsp;</p>
										<p>For buyers, it’s becoming increasingly important to differentiate between commissions and fee-based revenue, says The Rogers Group’s David Chal-mers, who is currently making the transition to a fee-based business. “Fees ultimately generate a more reliable income stream and are likely to result in less attrition,” he says. “Some shrinkage is inevitable but these are the type of assets that should command a premium.”</p>
										<p>However, while fee-based accounts can involve fairly large dollars and enhance a practice’s value, they come with a different sort of price as well. “You need to provide consistent service, with regular performance reviews and consultations,” Chalmers warns. “If you aren’t able to provide good client contact from the outset, these clients will be the first to disappear.”</p>

											<h4>Employee vs. Self-employed</h4>
										</div>
										<p>A recent Supreme Court ruling is likely to raise the costs of buying a book of business for many advisors, tax experts say, particularly those working for specific firms who are more likely to be classified as employees. The ruling focused on an advisor at Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. who paid $100,000 to buy a client list from a fellow advisor, deducting it as a business expense.&nbsp;</p>
										<p>The Canada Revenue Agency disallowed these deductions a few years ago on the theory that the advisor in question was, in fact, an employee. After several appeals, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the taxman. Had he been considered self-employed, the advisor would have been all right though. Still, for advisors who may be considered employees, the result of the decision is that any monies paid to access clients aren’t going to be deductible, increasing their acquisition costs dramatically.</p>
