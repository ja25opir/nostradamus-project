        <p>In business, strategic planning determines the long-term impact of an organization. Successful businesses identify their mission; their mission influences their vision. All these effect their strategy and their level of success. Without a good strategic plan, most companies flounder and then fail.</p>
<p>If strategic planning is so important to business success, it makes perfect sense that almost all successful individuals have a strategic plan for their own personal success!&nbsp; What about you? Do you have a strategic plan for your personal success?</p>
<p>Here’s what a good strategic plan covers…</p>
<ul>
<li>A Clear Vision Statement</li>
<li>A Solid Mission Statement</li>
<li>Identifying Everything That Will Cause Success</li>
<li>Identifying Risks, Obstacles, and Challenges</li>
<li>Developing Specific&nbsp;Strategies and Action Plans to Meet Objectives</li>
<li>Creating and Prioritize a Completion Time-line</li>
</ul>
<p>These make up the foundation of an attainable strategic plan.</p>
<p>To develop your own personal strategic plan, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your vision for your life/business?</li>
<li>What are the things you can do best?</li>
<li>What value are you (or your business) going to provide?</li>
<li>What needs do you fill for people/customers, that others cannot provide as well?</li>
<li>What image do you want for your business/yourself?</li>
<li>What excellent things do you want to be known for?</li>
<li>Who is your ideal customer?</li>
<li>What products and services can you provide in an excellent way?</li>
<li>What needs are you going to satisfy?</li>
<li>What are your personal/business philosophies, ethics, social commitment, and your values?</li>
<li>What value will you provide to your customers, your suppliers and your distributors?</li>
<li>Where will you be in one year, three years, and five years from now?</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure out how to grow your value and expand your current success. &nbsp;Decide what untapped markets you want to pursue and what specific things you can do to dominate by replacing your competitors and by fulfilling unmet needs.</p>
<p>Create a solid plan that includes your vision of your future, your mission in life, know what will ensure your success, know your obstacles and plan around them, create a success plan, and develop a task list with timelines.</p>
<p>When you do this little exercise and create a strategic plan out of it, you’ll find greater and greater success as you follow your plan!</p>
<p>To Your Success!</p>

        <p>Career Change Advice, Become a Millionaire…</p>
<p>I spent this weekend with several millionaires and we had a nice time. Nothing super extravagant, just great conversations.</p>
<p>One theme that kept coming up was how when you have money you can focus on doing so much more with your life. Unfortunately this seems too far away for most people. Most people are just trying to make a living. They have to worry about making ends meet.</p>
<p>It’s so interesting to think about, because each of these millionaires really grew up with little or nothing. Yet they each were able to rise above the situation, work smart, and obtain wealth.</p>
<p>The same can happen for YOU! If…</p>
<p>Henry Ford once said, “Whether you believe you can or you believe you can’t, you’re right!”</p>
<p>If you believe you are destined for greater things, YOU ARE! And you will reach greater things if you stand firm in this belief.</p>
<p>Today get focused on your incredible potential. Realize that you have unique talents, gifts, abilities that this world needs. Start asking yourself every day, “What can I do to serve others in a way that will return to me millions of dollars in financial worth?”</p>
<p>As you ask yourself this question daily, eventually you will start to receive answers, then simply take action on the ideas and solutions that are presented to you!</p>
<p>Now what better career could there be than to follow an abundant and rewarding life work?</p>
<p>If you’re considering a career change, why not think BIG! Why not just follow your dreams!</p>
<p>To your success!</p>

        <p>Choosing the Best Career Training For You!</p>
<p>Did you know that over 150,000 people per month search the web for the term “career training”?&nbsp; Now that’s a lot of people interested in career training.&nbsp; But the real question is, why are they interested in career training?&nbsp; What are they ultimately trying to get?</p>
<p>Most people look into career training because they want to find a good way to make more money. They either want to improve their current skills so they’re worth more money, or they want to develop new skills that will help them be more marketable.</p>
<p>If you are looking into career training, here are a few things to think about…</p>
<ol>
<li>Before you start looking for career training, it’s important to assess what’s important to you.&nbsp; Assess your likes and dislikes, your interests, your natural talents and abilities… in other words, only go after career training that is in line with your aptitudes and your interests.&nbsp; There are far too many people walking around with college degrees in fields they don’t even work in today.</li>
<li>Use online career assessment tests, personality profile test, skill assessments, interest assessments, and any other tool you can find to help you get clear.</li>
<li>Try to find people who already work in a career field you’re interested in, and learn as much about that field as you can.&nbsp; The pros and cons.</li>
<li> Try to find a part-time job or an apprenticeship in a career field you are interested in.</li>
<li>Don’t let potential earnings taint your selection process.&nbsp; I’ve seen a lot of people go into career fields because they hear you can make a lot of money in them, only to find out they actually hate that type of work.&nbsp; Wasted time, wasted effort, and it always ends in failure.&nbsp; Back to point number one, only go after something you can be successful in.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you realize how few people really end up working in their dream job, it’s all the more important to examine yourself closely and to choose your career training wisely!&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the five tips listed above and you’ll certainly be a lot closer to your dream job than if you don’t.</p>
<p>To your career success!</p>

        <p>Career Training Online, 5 Tips For Rapid Learning</p>
<p>The more you learn, the more you can earn…</p>
<p>Online learning can be a really great way to learn if you can discipline yourself. The human mind can only focus on one thing at a time, so if you want to learn any topic online, you’ll have to focus your attention on it.&nbsp; Time, attention, and repetition are the keys to absorbing information. With the right process you can actually learn and retain information pretty quickly and easily!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here are some powerful study tips that will help you learn faster and retain much more of the information you study…</p>
<p>5 Tips For Rapid Learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the topic you want to study.</li>
<li>Gather information from several sources on this topic.</li>
<li>Make an outline of everything you need to learn from the material.</li>
<li>Following your outline, skim through your study material and when you come upon a sentence, paragraph or chapter that relates to anything you need to know, dive into it, read it, and take notes. Then skim to the next relevant topic. Do this until you have taken some great notes for each topic or subject you need to learn more about.</li>
<li>Review your notes one hour after your initial study and 2 times per week after your initial study for one month. As you review your notes rephrase them and explain them out loud to a mirror or to another person. Act like you are teaching this information to someone else.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow this simple process, you’ll find you are learning and retaining information much faster and easier than most conventional study methods!</p>
<p>Give it a try and see for yourself!</p>
