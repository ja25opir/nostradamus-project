    UV waste water treatment bid approved</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Journal Review, Wade Coggeshall</font><br><br>
    Crawfordsville’s Board of Works agreed with the waste water superintendent 
    and approved the lowest bid to install an <b>ultraviolet disinfecting system</b> 
    in the city’s sewage plant.<br>
    <br>
    At Wednesday’s meeting, the board accepted Bowin Construction’s bid of 
    $596,000. Installation should begin Jan. 5. City officials received five 
    bids total.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>UV system</b> will sterilize bacteria in the water using a powerful 
    wavelength from light. Waste Water Director Tom Mitchell said the plant 
    currently uses a mixture of sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite to 
    treat water. The sodium bisulfite neutralizes the leftover chlorine, which 
    is poisonous to fish. However the chemicals still end up changing into salt 
    once discharged from the plant.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>UV system</b> not only will prevent salt forming in streams, but 
    Mitchell said it will be safer for workers. The current chemical makeup is 
    15 percent bleach, which is enough to cause blisters if it comes in contact 
    with skin and can eat through clothes. Mitchell said common household bleach 
    is only 1 percent.<br>
    <br>
    Even better, the <b>UV system</b> will cost less to operate, meaning there 
    won’t be any rate increases for customers. Under the new process, Mitchell 
    said it will cost about $15,000 annually to operate the plant vs. the 
    current $52,000. He also projects the city saving money by switching to the
    <b>UV system</b> ahead of state mandate, when it might cost more to do so in 
    the future.<br>
    <br>
    The city has received proceeds from a $2 million bond sale conducted last 
    spring to pay for the project. The <b>UV mode</b> is expected to be ready by 
    April 1, when disinfecting of the water supply is required by law through 
    October 31.</p>

    City will switch to UV disinfecting</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">Journal Review, Wade Coggeshall</font><br><br>
    City officials received five bids for the <b>ultraviolet disinfecting system</b> 
    project at the waste water treatment plant. The bids were opened Thursday 
    afternoon in Mayor John Zumer’s office.<br>
    <br>
    The bids were: Maddox Construction, $598,900; Reynolds Construction, 
    $671,000; Bowin Construction, $596,000; and Graves Plumbing, $602,608. Since 
    engineering estimates for the job were set at $608,000, waste water 
    superintendent Tom Mitchell said the bids were in line with what he 
    expected.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>UV system</b> will sterilize bacteria in the water using a powerful 
    wavelength from light. Currently the waste water plant uses chlorine to 
    disinfect water, but a new state mandate calls for changing to the <b>UV 
    system</b>. Though the conversion isn’t yet required, Mitchell is moving 
    forward to have the <b>UV mode</b> in place by<br>
    April 1, when disinfecting of the water supply is required by law through 
    Oct. 31.<br>
    <br>
    “I’d rather be proactive than reactive,” Mitchell said.<br>
    <br>
    The city took out a $2 million bond in April to pay for the project. A 
    motion to proceed should be made in early January.</p>

    Meridian Design Introduces The AquaStarPlus™ Portable UV-C Water Purification And Lantern Bottle</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">SAN JOSE, Calif. /EWORLDWIRE/</font><br><br>
    Meridian Design today announced the release of an inexpensive patent-pending 
    water treatment system. Combining the benefit of sterilizing <b>UV-C 
    radiation</b> with an ultra-light, portable one liter bottle, the unit kills 
    pathogens without resorting to tiresome filters or nasty chemicals. <br>
    <br>
    The AquaStarPlus™ <b>UV Portable Water Purifier</b> is a germicidal 
    treatment solution appropriate for use in all climates and settings for 
    campers, travelers, emergency crews or families who need to depend on having 
    clean water. <br>
    <br>
    Filters, which can be heavy and require effort to use, can clog easily and 
    miss viruses. Chemicals like iodine and chlorine drops take hours to be 
    effective and contribute carcinogenic and toxic-free radicals to drinking 
    water. <b>UV</b> takes 90 seconds to kill bacteria, protists and even 
    viruses with little effort and leaves no toxic compounds in the water. The 
    simple one-button user interface activates the cleaning cycle and the 
    ultrabright LED lantern independently. <br>
    <br>
    The website provides detailed information about the science behind the 
    AquaStarPlus along with user's guide and review links. A version for 
    developing countries has being deployed to India and South Africa and is in 
    the initial review phase.</p>

    District looks to bypass bid process to buy pool UV system</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">By Ben Moriarty, Staff Writer; Murrysville Star</font><br><br>
    Six weeks after discovering contaminants in the middle school swimming pool, 
    Franklin Regional officials are making quick work in solving the problem.<br>
    <br>
    After announcing the chloramine problem in late November, Dennis Majewski, 
    director of district services, told the board on Monday that he was 
    confident in choosing an <b>ultraviolet system</b> as a long-term solution.<br>
    <br>
    Majewski investigated three possible long-term solutions to fix the problem 
    -- replacing the chlorine system, an HVAC system for air circulation and an
    <b>ultraviolet system</b> with the pool discharge.<br>
    <br>
    Of the three, it appears the district will pursue the <b>ultraviolet system</b>, 
    but the HVAC flow across the pool could be increased as well. <br>
    <br>
    Majewski said replacing the chlorine system with ozone or oxidizing agents 
    is too expensive and highly experimental.<br>
    <br>
    When board member Lynn Gurrentz asked if he believed the <b>ultraviolet 
    system</b> would alleviate the problem, Majewski said yes. "My comfort level 
    with the system is a 10."<br>
    <br>
    Though chloramine problems are relatively new throughout the country, 
    Majewski found more than 100 instances of successful results after an <b>
    ultraviolet system</b> was installed.<br>
    <br>
    "Within two years of installation, it's basically been a cure-all for many 
    places," he said. <br>
    <br>
    Majewski received a $43,400 price for the system, and said installation and 
    modification would cost an extra $12,000.<br>
    <br>
    With the board's approval to start the bidding process, he hoped to have 
    everything in place by March, but finance director Dan Watson said it could 
    happen much faster.<br>
    <br>
    Because the chloramines are a health issue, Watson said the district could 
    file for a mandate waiver to bypass the bidding process and speed-up the 
    solution.<br>
    <br>
    The idea was well-received by the board, which unanimously authorized the 
    administration to enter into a mandate waiver up to $55,000.<br>
    <br>
    The problem surfaced in late October. It is caused by body contaminants such 
    as sweat, body oil, urine and ammonia particles.<br>
    <br>
    Students have experienced obnoxious odors and irritation to the skin, eyes 
    and lungs.<br>
    <br>
    Over Thanksgiving break, the pool was drained, cleaned and refilled and its 
    lights were replaced.</p>

    Tribe using treated wastewater on golf course</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">AP Connecticut, Newsday.com</font><br>
    <br>
    NORTH STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) Every flush at the Foxwoods Resort Casino is 
    helping keep the fairways green on the Mashantucket Pequots' new Lake of 
    Isles golf course.<br>
    <br>
    The state Department of Environmental Protection recently granted the tribe 
    a first-of-its-kind permit to use treated wastewater to irrigate the course 
    in North Stonington. About 600,000 gallons of water a day are now used on 
    the course.<br>
    <br>
    The tribe's wastewater plant uses microbes to get rid of any organisms, then
    <b>disinfects the water using ultraviolet light</b>.<br>
    <br>
    "It's called keeping it local - putting water back where it is discharged," 
    said Gina McCarthy, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental 
    Protection, who toured the plant Thursday.<br>
    <br>
    McCarthy says she hopes the system can be used as a model for others across 
    the state.<br>
    <br>
    McCarthy said DEP did not have to rewrite its regulations to permit the 
    tribe to recycle its wastewater, had to make sure the water is being applied 
    in a way that is going to protect the people at the course and in the 
    surrounding community.<br>
    <br>
    "It's a matter of getting to know your effluent," she said.</p>

    <p>A new water purification technology study provides an efficient, 
    systematic and reliable way to know trends, opportunities and risks in water 
    disinfection industry and to evaluate present situation and further 
    development. The water study also identifies and evaluates the growth and 
    profit opportunities within the segments of technologies / markets and value 
    chain. It deals with the following technology sectors:<br>
    <br>
    - Drinking water, bottled water, swimming pool water<br>
    - Water and Industrial Water disinfection<br>
    - Disinfection of waste water in industry and municipality<br>
    - Application of emerging membrane technology<br>
    - Potential application of future technologies like nanotechnology or 
    molecular technologies<br>
    <br>
    The study is constructed by sectors and can be obtained either completely, 
    or each sector separately. The markets are presented by countries/regions 
    and by technologies/processes, as well as by applications and branches. The 
    study provides an analysis and profiles, as well as presentation of the 
    leading water disinfection companies and their factors of success and 
    technology portfolio.</p>
    <p>The markets for water disinfection, water purification and securing water 
    quality with other methods is growing worldwide between 8 and 25 percent 
    depending on the sector, branch and country. Water Disinfection is a study 
    about water disinfection, purification and info/control automation in total 
    including the most recent technological innovations with nanotechnologies 
    and molecular technologies. These new technologies will change the water 
    treatment markets in the next 10 years dramatically. The costs and prices of 
    water in the future will largely depend on the disinfection necessity and 
    the applied technologies. <br>
    <br>
    Different water sectors face problems to keep the early water quality 
    through conventional treatment / disinfection approaches. Meanwhile the 
    water quality regulations are becoming more stringent, complex and costly. 
    The concerns about the biotech pollution or terrorism challenge the 
    capability of water disinfection as well. In this study different water 
    disinfection/purification methods are discussed. This includes physical and 
    chemical processes such as the usage of chlorine, <b>UV</b>, use of ozone, 
    filtration and membrane processes with pathogen removal, and also thermal 
    processes such as distillation, evaporation/condensation, and steam 
    stripping.<br>
    <br>
    A special part about nanotechnology and molecular technology is added in the 
    study. The molecular featured processes represent the developing trend of 
    water disinfection/purification because of their efficiency, preciseness and 
    high performance-price ratio. A number of nanotechnologies are already 
    utilized in membrane process and <b>UV disinfection</b>. More applications 
    are to be found in more sectors in the water disinfection industries during 
    the next years.</p>

	is a market for GB Environmental’s patented second generation <b>UV 
	disinfection technology</b> and what its key benefits are:<br>
	<br>
	“It’s no secret that scientists have known about the <b>germicidal waveband 
	of UV C</b>, which kills a range of pathogenic waterborne micro-organisms by 
	disrupting their DNA chain, for a number of years now. However, first 
	generation systems met with a mixed response, with maintenance and 
	efficiency issues limiting the widespread embracing of the technology.<br>
	<br>
	With the development of second generation <b>UV equipment</b> in the form of 
	GB Environmental’s SafeGuard range, we’ve been able to introduce the 
	technology to a number of companies, where we have been able to demonstrate 
	significant cost savings.”<br>
	<br>
	The introduction of GB Environmental’s SafeGuard range, has been 
	specifically designed to eradicate the problems that first generation <b>UV 
	disinfection</b> units had – namely inconsistent disinfection performance 
	and a lack of means to keep the lamps clean. Each has a unique integral 
	Tioxispring® cleaning system that provides continuous and efficient results.
	<br>
	<br>
	This maintains the <b>UV lamps</b> in optimum functionality, requiring 
	minimal maintenance with only the annual need for replacement. Even in the 
	event of one lamp failing, the remaining lamps still provide the minimum 
	dose for adequate disinfection.<br>
	<br>
	The automatic cleaning and light management system ensures that the system 
	is exactly what it purports to be – a highly reliable, low maintenance 
	alternative.<br>
	<br>
	With the latest control systems utilizing high efficiency ballasts to ensure 
	optimum lamp performance under all conditions, the SafeGuard range is able 
	to disinfect effluents with transmissivity as low as 40%. <br>
	<br>
	Malcolm Snowball, Technical Director at GB Environmental and one of the 
	three scientists who discovered that certain wavelengths of <b>UV light</b> 
	killed cryptosporidium, commented:<br>
	<br>
	“The SafeGuard range of equipment has been designed and built with 
	flexibility in mind, which is why we have been involved with companies 
	across a variety of sectors over the past year. The SafeGuard range can be 
	used in a variety of applications, as a stand alone or combined with other 
	treatment processes.<br>
	<br>
	Moreover, the SafeGuard range is much more economical than first generation 
	machines, since its spectrally-enhanced amalgam lamps provide an alternative 
	to the use of medium pressure lamps within the disinfection process. This 
	means that significant cost savings can be made because they require less 
	energy to operate. “</p>

    Bartlett company cleans air with UV technology</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">By Drew Harris, The Bartlett Express</font></p>
    <p>With the recent concern about avian flu and other pandemic viruses 
    spreading to the United States, some people are looking for ways to protect 
    their homes and businesses.<br>
    <br>
    Safe Air Solutions, a Bartlett-based company, offers systems that 
    effectively kill 99.9% of all airborne viruses, bacteria and mold in a home 
    or office. Safe Air specializes in <b>ultra violet germicidal irradiation 
    (UVGI)</b> “kill chambers” that are installed in ventilation systems.<br>
    <br>
    David Skelton, founder of Safe Air Solutions, said <b>UVGI technology</b> 
    has been around since the 1940s and has been in use for years in hospitals, 
    jails, government offices and large corporations. From the common cold or 
    flu to anthrax or avian flu, airborne biological contaminants are 
    effectively neutralized by the system.<br>
    <br>
    “The <b>UV technology</b> destroys all airborne biological contaminants,” 
    Skelton said. “All bacteria and viruses are destroyed within half of a 
    second. It also filters dust and destroys mold. This creates a safe harbor 
    in any building whether it be a home or office.”<br>
    <br>
    Airborne viruses and bacteria are spread throughout a building by the 
    ventilation system. Whenever someone sneezes or coughs in a room, those 
    contaminants are carried throughout the building.<br>
    <br>
    “It's like when you bake cookies,” Skelton said. “You bake them in the 
    kitchen, but before too long, you can smell them in all the rooms of the 
    house. That is because the ventilation carries the smell to each room. It 
    carries airborne contaminants in the same way.”<br>
    <br>
    While a house full of bacteria, viruses and mold is an unsettling thought, 
    Skelton said technology exists to prevent it. The technology works using a 
    system of ultra violet lights and filters that are placed inside a 
    building's ventilation system. The <b>UV light</b> penetrates the cellular 
    membrane of biological material and irradiates the cell. The contaminant is 
    then unable to reproduce and cannot multiply in the human body.<br>
    <br>
    Skelton said the <b>UVGI technology</b> is used by FedEx, the U.S. Post 
    Office, the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center and at similar facilities 
    across the country. Because of the threat of biological terror attacks, the 
    federal government is also embracing the technology.<br>
    <br>
    “All new federal buildings must include this technology in the building - it 
    is a law,” Skelton said. “They use it primarily because of the bioterror 
    threat.”<br>
    <br>
    While the system effectively kills biological contaminants, Skelton said it 
    also removes dust and volatile organic chemicals from things like paint and 
    adhesives from carpet.<br>
    <br>
    “There are things like paint, hair spray and carpet adhesives that are not 
    biological, but people are allergic to,” Skelton said. “It keeps people from 
    having reactions to those things as well.”<br>
    <br>
    In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Skelton said he has been talking with FEMA 
    and HUD in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Florida to install his system in 
    buildings. He is currently traveling the country to set up dealers for homes 
    and businesses.<br>
    <br>
    The cost for Safe Air systems begins at $1,800, and Skelton said his company 
    has systems for any size home or office.</p>

    Valeo and Air Quality: Putting Health and Comfort First</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">The Auto Channel, September 13</font></p>
    <p>FRANKFURT, Germany, September 13 -- Valeo has been working on improving 
    in-cabin air quality for many years and has recently designed seven 
    innovative systems to enhance occupant comfort and, above all, to provide 
    better protection from pollution. These seven new systems represent new 
    benchmarks in this specialist field.<br>
    <br>
    Increased and long-lasting protection from external pollution<br>
    <br>
    Pollutant particles, especially from the ever-increasing number of 
    diesel-fuelled vehicles, are invisible to the naked eye but can be harmful 
    to humans. These particles, which may be smaller than one micron in 
    diameter, are charged through a corona electrical field and collected on an 
    electrostatic filter.<br>
    <br>
    To complement this initial protection, Valeo has now added a photo-catalysis 
    combined filter. This is composed of a blend of active carbon and titanium 
    dioxide and an ultraviolet light source which self-regenerates by 
    photo-catalytic reaction. The <b>UV lamp </b>activates the decomposition of 
    gas and micro-organisms via the chemical reaction between the pollutants and 
    the titanium dioxide. The advantage of this system is that it ensures 
    optimal protection of vehicle occupants by a very effective filtering action 
    that is maintained throughout the long life of the filter, up to 5 years or 
    100,000 kilometers.<br>
    <br>
    Odor-free air-conditioning<br>
    <br>
    Unpleasant odors produced by some air-conditioning systems after several 
    years of use are a major complaint among motorists. The air conditioning 
    evaporators can trap malodorous gases and then release them suddenly when 
    the system is activated.<br>
    <br>
    To avoid this unpleasant phenomenon, Valeo has developed an evaporator 
    covered with a layer of varnish applied directly to the aluminum. This 
    hydrophilic, biostatic, and chromium-free anti-odor evaporator eliminates 
    the danger of odorous gases being trapped and ensures perfect surface 
    quality throughout the product's life.<br>
    <br>
    In the air filter, located upstream of the evaporator, is a cartridge 
    containing an antiseptic compound. This compound spreads naturally 
    throughout the air-conditioning system and destroys the bacteria and 
    microbes that cause the offensive smell.<br>
    <br>
    A breath of fresh air in the cabin<br>
    <br>
    Pollution, in the form of gas and dust, and unpleasant smells may also come 
    from the cabin itself. The air-purification module with photo-catalytic 
    filter (which can be mounted inside the cabin) provides an additional action 
    to deliver clean, safe air in air-con recycling mode.<br>
    <br>
    As well as eliminating unpleasant odors, Valeo's systems protect the health 
    of all vehicle occupants<br>
    <br>
    The ion generator, for example, emits positive and negative ions that catch 
    airborne microbes and fungi and effectively neutralize them. This system, 
    known as the Plasmacluster Ion(TM) generator is already on the Japanese 
    market and testifies to the Group's capacity to innovate.<br>
    <br>
    Superior air quality available to everyone<br>
    <br>
    Valeo's BioClip(TM) anti-bacteria diffuser is a world first and is now 
    available through Valeo's aftermarket network.<br>
    <br>
    The system can be fitted to any type of vehicle since it simply clips on to 
    the cabin air filter. It has a guaranteed minimum working life of 12 months, 
    similar to the air filter itself.<br>
    <br>
    BioClip(TM) uses a natural anti-microbial agent (a plant molecule) that is 
    continuously diffused into the cabin to destroy the microorganisms that 
    develop in the air-conditioning circuit and which can generate unpleasant 
    odors and allergic reactions.<br>
    <br>
    Alongside the cabin air filter, which protects against particles and 
    external pollution (gas, dust, etc), BioClip(TM) offers an additional air 
    purification function that spreads clean air when in either air-con normal 
    or recycling mode.<br>

    <br>
    Astralux Inc., a pioneer in compound semiconductor research and development, 
    today announced that it has been awarded a Small Business Innovative 
    Research (SBIR) Phase II award from the United States Air Force. With this 
    award, work will continue toward the project's objective to develop a 
    portable <b>UV</b>/X-Ray Biodecontamination system suitable for 
    biodecontamination of a variety of biological agents which could be used in 
    bioterrorism attacks.</p>
    <p>The malicious distribution of Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) through the 
    U.S. Postal Service subsequent to the attacks on the World Trade Center in 
    the fall of 2001 demonstrated the vulnerability of the United States to 
    biological threats. These events showed the need for improved 
    decontamination methods for buildings and assets exposed to various 
    biological agents, because the current methods rely on the application of a 
    chlorine- or formaldehyde-based liquid and are toxic, corrosive, and harmful 
    to papers, books, and sensitive equipment such as landing gear, brake 
    assemblies, and aircraft interiors.<br>
    <br>
    The combination of a <b>high-intensity ultraviolet emitter</b> and an X-ray 
    radiation source within a single package would offer a clean, non-toxic, and 
    non-corrosive alternative for the surface and subsurface multi-biological 
    warfare agent decontamination of buildings and equipment. Astralux, Inc. is 
    developing an electron-beam pumped semiconductor <b>UV source technology</b>, 
    which when combined with an X-ray source, will result in a <b>UV</b>/X-ray 
    biodecontamination unit that does not suffer from the shortcomings mentioned 
    above. This <b>UV</b>/X-ray biodecontamination system will prove useful in a 
    wide range of settings requiring disinfection. These applications include <b>
    mail disinfection, air and water purification, and medical sterilization</b>.<br>
    <br>
    "The threat of biological attacks on government facilities and acts of 
    bioterrorism against civilian targets is still very real," commented Dr. 
    Rande Treece, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This <b>UV</b>/X-ray 
    technology represents an innovative approach towards biodecontamination and 
    holds significant potential for a wide range of uses towards neutralizing 
    this deadly threat. Astralux is proud to be helping to defend our country 
    and excited to develop technology in the Homeland Security market."<br>

    Packaging Manufacturer Saves Money Treating Cooling Tower Water with UV</a><br>
    </b>Process And Control Today</p>
    <p>Danish packaging manufacturer Styropack A/S has made significant savings 
    since installing a Berson <b>UV disinfection system to treat water in its 
    open cooling tower</b>. The cooling water is used for compressors, 
    production equipment and a steam boiler.<br>
    <br>
    Before switching to <b>UV</b> the company had been experiencing problems 
    with the water cooling system. Firstly, the lamellae* of the cooling towers 
    were becoming fouled with organic material and bacteria and needed 
    thoroughly cleaning every six months - a time consuming and costly process. 
    The reduced efficiency of the cooling tower lamellae also meant the tower's 
    ventilators were often operating at maximum power, resulting in increased 
    power costs. In addition, there was increased consumption of make-up water 
    in the plant.<br>
    <br>
    Styropack A/S initially tried to solve the problem of the lamella fouling by 
    using a costly biocide. Correct dosing was difficult to calculate, however, 
    resulting in periodic overdosing.<br>
    <br>
    The company then decided to carry out a trial with a <b>UV disinfection 
    system</b>, which had an immediate beneficial effect. Following consultation 
    with HOH A/S, Berson's Danish distributor, a bersonInLine(r) system with a 
    bersonMultiWave(r), <b>medium pressure UV lamp</b> was installed. The 
    bersonMultiWave(r) lamp destroys microorganisms' DNA, RNA and enzymes, 
    ensuring permanent, irreversible inactivation. A <b>UV sensor monitors the 
    activity of the UV lamp</b>, altering the <b>UV dose</b> accordingly. In 
    addition, an automatic wiper keeps the quartz sleeve surrounding the <b>UV 
    lamp</b> clean. The only regular maintenance necessary is changing the <b>UV 
    lamp</b> once a year, a simple process which is carried out by on-site staff 
    in a few minutes.<br>
    <br>
    Since the <b>UV system</b> was installed, just over a year ago, the cooling 
    tower only needs servicing annually as part of routine maintenance 
    procedures. The tower's ventilators now also run at the minimum level and 
    there is no need for biocide dosing. Costs have therefore been dramatically 
    reduced and the water in the open cooling basin is now so clear you can see 
    the bottom.<br>
    <br>
    Based in the Netherlands, Berson <b>UV</b>-techniek is a world leader in <b>
    UV technology</b> for a wide range of applications, including process, 
    waste, drinking and swimming pool water treatment, dechlorination, ozone 
    removal and TOC reduction. The company has over 30 years' experience in the 
    design, development, manufacture and distribution of <b>UV systems</b> 
    worldwide.</p>

	World's biggest UV water treatment plant coming</a></b><br><font size="1">by 
	Len Maniace, Westchester Journal News, Westchester, NY</font><br>
    <br>
    Work is scheduled to begin by September on the world's largest <b>
	ultraviolet water treatment plant</b>, a nearly $600 million facility 
	designed to sterilize two pesky parasites that have roots in a disease 
	outbreak that sickened 400,000 people in Milwaukee a dozen years ago. <br>
	<br>
	To be built on the Grasslands reservation next to the county jail in Mount 
	Pleasant, the <b>UV plant</b> can treat up to 2.4 billion gallons of water a 
	day from New York City's two largest reservoir systems, the Catskill and the 
	Delaware, which are the source of most water used by Westchester and New 
	York City. <br>
	<br>
	The plant will mean at least another $2.3 million annually in tax revenue 
	for the town of Mount Pleasant, the Pocantico Hills schools and Westchester 
	County. <br>
	<br>
	The massive project stems from a campaign against two single-cell organisms 
	— Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Though these parasites may have little or no 
	effect on healthy people, they can cause severe diarrhea and other 
	gastrointestinal symptoms, which can kill individuals with impaired immune 
	systems. <br>
	<br>
	The presence of these two organisms led to a brief water alert two weeks ago 
	in New York City after a torrential rain washed soil and some parasites into 
	the Kensico Reservoir. That alert called for the elderly, the very young and 
	others with weakened immune systems to boil tap water or drink bottled 
	water…<br>
	<br>
	… Construction of the <b>UV plant</b> will be a massive project not expected 
	to be complete until 2010. The two-story <b>UV plant</b> will be a large 
	building, 410 feet by 200 feet. One floor will be underground and the other 
	above ground level, varying in height from 30 to 50 feet.</p>

    Not all air-cleaning devices are appropriate for home use – some can be 
	harmful to human health. The ARB recommends that ozone generators, "air 
	purifiers" that intentionally produce ozone, not be used in the home. Ozone 
	is a gas that can cause health problems, including eye and respiratory tract 
	irritation and breathing difficulty. For more information on ozone

    The bureaucratic wheels have begun turning on a $37 million water filtration 
    plant the state has ordered a water utility company to build.<br><br>
    The contentious issue involves the quality of drinking water along much of

    <font size="1">Science Daily</font><br><br>
    A team of engineers from Washington University in St. Louis and the 
    University of Colorado at Boulder has removed bioaerosols — airborne 
    biological particulate matter — from the air of a hospital therapy pool 
    using a new generation of hybrid filters.<br><br>
    The bioaerosols identified in the unnamed Midwestern hospital pool had 
    sickened nine lifeguards who had become ill with hypersensitivity 
    pneumonitis, a lung condition that mimics pneumonia symptoms. This forced 
    the pool to shut down. It is now reopened.<br><br>
    Lars T. Angenent, Ph.D., Washington University assistant professor of 
    chemical engineering, and the Colorado engineers mounted three 
    high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) <b>ultraviolet (UV)</b> air filters 
    on the ceiling of the pool room. They compared concentrations of total 
    bacteria, culturable bacteria and airborne endotoxin — a poison present in 
    gram-negative bacterial cell walls that can cause severe inflammatory 
    responses — with and without the air filters operating under similar 
    conditions. They compared the performance of the filters twice, one year 
    apart, and found that the filters reduced concentrations of culturable 
    bacteria by 69 and 80 percent during monitoring periods executed in 
    respective years. The filters reduced concentrations of total bacteria by 12 
    and 76 percent, respectively, over the same span. But the filters did not 
    affect airborne endotoxin concentrations.<br><br>
    "This specific filter has a blower that takes a high volume of air and puts 
    it through a filter that screens bacteria and even smaller particles," said 
    Angenent, a member of Washington University's Environmental Engineering 
    Science Program. " And after the filter there is <b>UV light</b>; if 
    something passes through the filter, the <b>UV</b> zaps it. It's a 
    combination approach that appears very effective. The bacterium that had 
    been causing illness was <i>Mycobacterium avium</i>, which can make 
    immunocompromised people ill, and since a lot of elderly use therapy pools, 
    that's a concern. However, since using the filters, no one has gotten 
    sick."…</p>

    Catalytic Reaction Zaps Bacteria – Hospitals could benefit from a tube that 
    vaporizes microbes</a></b><br>
    <font size="1">by Marl Peplow, news@nature.com </font><br><br>
    A mottled glass tube bathed in <b>ultraviolet light</b> may prove a great 
    help to hospitals by keeping dangerous bacteria out of their air. Scientists 
    have developed a simple, reusable device that can knock out more than 99% of 
    microbes in air conditioners. The device relies on titanium dioxide, a 
    compound used in white pigments and found in common household products such 
    as toothpaste. When exposed to <b>ultraviolet light</b>, bacteria landing on 
    a surface of titanium dioxide are converted to a vapour of carbon dioxide 
    and water, along with harmless organics…<br><br>
    …The team tested its device using <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which commonly 
    cause food poisoning. Each cubic meter of contaminated air flowing into the 
    reactor contained about 15,000 clumps of bacteria capable of forming a 
    colony; the outlet air contained no viable colony-forming units, report the 
    researchers in the journal Chemical Communications1…<br><br>
    …Keller says the system should also work against <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, 
    which causes Legionnaires' disease and is about the same size as <i>E. coli</i>. 
    This microbe is particularly good at breeding in the pools of water that can 
    form inside air-conditioning ducts. "<i>Legionella</i> can be a problem 
    wherever you have warm, recirculating water," says Colin Mathieson, an 
    engineer who deals with disinfection equipment at Wedeco UV Systems, based 
    in Sudbury, UK… <br>

    <b>3 May 2005: Biological Evaluation of Ultraviolet Light Systems</b><br><br>
    Under contract to Battelle, the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) has 
    established a Technology Testing and Evaluation Program (TTEP) to test <b>UV 
    lights in ultraviolet air treatment systems</b>. The TTEP was established by 
    EPA’s National Homeland Security Research Center as an outgrowth of EPA’s 
    successful and internationally recognized Environmental Technology 
    Verification (ETV) Program.<br><br>
    The mission of TTEP is to identify and test technologies to protect against 
    biological contaminants in buildings and other public spaces. The Research 
    Triangle Institute (RTI) will verify the inactivation efficiency of heating, 
    ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) <b>ultraviolet light (UV) systems</b> 
    for culturable bioaerosol challenges.</p>

    Self-sustaining DSA with UV LED sterilizes water</b><br>
    <br>
    The self-sustaining Dynamic Sterilizing Apparatus (DSA) uses <b>Ultraviolet 
    Light Emitting Diodes (UV LED)</b> to irradiate water-borne pathogens.<br>
    <br>
    2005 not only marked a new year, but a breakthrough in technology as well. 
    An Ohio team has been in the process of conducting flow-through water 
    purification benchmark testing, since February of this year, with the use of
    <b>UV LED</b> and their patent pending self-sustaining technology.<br>
    <br>
    The smaller LED devices have more advantages over the mercury vapor lamps 
    such as durability, life expectancy, and use of less heat and power. The 
    self-sustaining technology will eliminate the need for any outside energy 
    force to operate the device.<br>
    <br>
    OHT, LLC, an Ohio startup company, has designed and developed a novel 
    prototype that will allow the flow of water to be treated by the 16 MEmocvd™ 
    AIGaN/GaN LED chips, emitting at 270 nm range, made by the South Carolina 
    based firm Sensor Electronic Technology (SET)...</p>
