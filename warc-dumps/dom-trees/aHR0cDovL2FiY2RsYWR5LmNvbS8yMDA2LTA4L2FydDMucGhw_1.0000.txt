            <p class="style19">I don’t know how many times I’ve heard 
              a friend complain about how miserable his or her dating life is. 
              Dating in 2006 is the real Common Enemy. It’s reviled and 
              frequently painful, yet what choice do you have? You want to meet 
              someone and plan a future somehow, right? Maybe you’re just 
              not ready to throw up your hands and get an arranged marriage, but 
              you haven’t made this dating thing work for you yet.</p>
            <p class="style19">Well, it’s possible to take some of the excruciating 
              pain out of dating, and maybe, with a little luck and the right 
              attitude, you might even have fun. I can’t promise you eternal 
              happiness or marital bliss. But I can tell you what <em>not</em> 
              to do, and if you can accomplish that, a relationship could follow.

              Believe it or not, this is the easiest part. This is also where 
              most people are their own worst enemies, because most people try 
              too hard. Here’s where popular wisdom and reality diverge. 
              The world, television, and even some of your friends would have 
              you believe that the best place to meet that special someone is 
              a bar or club on a weekend night. While it’s true that it’s 
              possible, it’s certainly not easier, and, in fact, is usually 
              a lot harder than other less typical, yet more effective—and 
              ultimately more fun—ways of meeting people.<br>

		  <tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p class="style19">For starters, consider the following 
              concept: if you do something social that you enjoy for long enough, 
              you’re likely to meet someone you find interesting enough 
              to go out with at least once. Whether it’s hiking in a group, 
              riding motorcycles, going rock-climbing, working out, joining a 
              photography class, or even just traveling—go with one of your 
              hobbies and you’ll have better luck sticking with that. First, 
              you’re probably good at it, and second, you’ll simply 
              be out enjoying yourself rather than just trying to pick up someone. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">So, get a hobby—one that you actually enjoy, rather than 
              one you coldly calculate will be great for meeting your significant 
              other. The goal here is to relax, meet like-minded people, and let 
              yourself go. The rest will happen naturally with time.</p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>The First Date (and the Second, and the Third):</strong><br>
              You’ve asked him or her out, and wonder of wonders, he or 
              she agreed to meet up with you. This is where the real fun begins, 
              or, if you’re not playing your cards right, never begins. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">Some pointers:<br>
              After two dates, you're not dating yet. If you are, there's something 
              wrong with BOTH of you.</p>

          <tbody><tr><td valign="top" colspan="2">
<p class="style19">Stalking does not equal 
              dating. Men: leaving a note on her car without your name or any 
              other information besides, "I think you're cute!" is really 
              creepy. Ladies: repeatedly calling someone you’ve never met 
              or only met once or twice comes across in much the same way. </p>
            <p class="style19">Taboo topics for a first date: exes, baby names, the kind of wedding 
              you want, the number and types of sexual encounters (or fantasies) 
              you've had, your tricked-out BMW, your awesomely amazing job, your 
              gigantic salary. Rein in, please.</p>
            <p class="style19">Ladies: never describe yourself as a "kind of a witch" 
              (or similar) on a first date. </p>
            <p class="style19">Men: Taco Bell is generally not a good place for a first date. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">Men: Reach for the check first. If it's a first date and things 
              are going well, pay for the meal. Otherwise, you’ll look like 
              your mother didn't raise you right. If it's a second date or later, 
              always <em>always</em> reach for the check. You may wind up paying 
              frequently. Stop whining; it's called "chivalry." While 
              you're at it, hold the door on the way out. </p>
            <p class="style19">And if your date’s insisting on paying, <strong>allow this. 
              </strong><br>
              <br>
              Ladies: Reach for the check. If you don't at least offer, you look 
              pretty terrible yourself. Just avoid the Check Tug-of-War! </p>
            <p class="style19">A general rule of thumb for both genders is to offer verbally twice: 
              "Allow me…No, please, it would be my pleasure to pick 
              this up…You get it next time." If, after that, your date 
              is STILL insisting on paying, let them. If your date holds it against 
              you later, kick him or her to the curb. There are plenty of issues 
              you can be neurotic about later on in the relationship. You'll probably 
              spend a large percentage of your time with this person at dinner, 
              so if they get hung up on it now, you'll hate them later. </p>
            <p class="style19"> <strong>Phone Calls:</strong><br>
              You’re going to spend some time on the phone getting to know 
              your potential partner. How you handle phone time will determine 
              whether it’s so fun that he or she will want to call you back 
              again and again or whether your number is blocked within seconds 
              of hanging up. The less work the phone is, the more the phone will 
              work for you. </p>
            <p class="style19">Ladies: Don’t talk about fashion or clothes. Don’t 
              talk about yourself endlessly. Remember, you’re already the 
              master of the telephone. Men think the phone’s for emergencies 
              and finding his friends while out drinking, while you know that 
              it is the most important information-sharing tool of the 21st century. 
              You have the advantage here already, so how about some nice conversational 
              give-and-take?</p>
            <p class="style19">Men: Don’t talk about how cool you are or how uncool you 
              are, because either way, you’re just not cool. Be funny, be 
              cordial, but always <em>keep it light.</em> Talk about something 
              ridiculous, find out about the other person, make a joke. Don’t 
              get mean, don’t get angry, and don’t—ever—lose 
              your head. Your worst case scenario should involve you politely 
              saying that you need to go and then hanging up the phone. </p>
            <p class="style19">Both genders: Caller ID is your friend. If you don't want to talk 
              to someone, just don't answer the phone. The flip side: don't continuously 
              call someone if they don't call you back within a week. It's over. 
              Move on. </p>
            <p class="style19">Do not treat the phone call as a free therapy session with a stranger. 
              No discussing your ex, how you were cheated on, or how much you 
              hate specific genders. Because, see, that really comes across as 
              psycho. And you don’t want to be a psycho, do you? Right. 
              So if you feel a bout of hysteria coming on, try this one on for 
              size: beg off, hang up the phone, hug your teddy and cry into your 
              pillow instead. You’re still a loser, but now the person you 
              were talking to <em>doesn’t</em> know it. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Internet Dating:</strong><br>
              It's high time someone addressed internet dating, considering how 
              prevalent it's become. Look, people, internet dating is not the 
              shameful taboo you might have once thought it to be. Odds are by 
              now you’ve tried it at least once. And if it didn’t 
              work for you, you might want to consider the possibility that maybe—just 
              maybe—you weren’t doing things right. </p>
            <p class="style19">Done properly, the internet is a great way to meet 
              some really nice people. But handled improperly, it’s frustrating, 
              time-consuming, and occasionally bizarre or dangerous. Common sense 
              and good humor will go a long way here. </p>
            <p class="style19">Ladies: Do not use the terms "princess," "diva," 
              "beauty and brains," "the perfect blend of East and 
              West," or any other clichés when writing a profile or 
              choosing a handle. Remember, if your profile sounds pretentious, 
              silly, or trite, well…you probably are, too. Also, you didn’t 
              really grow up in Buckingham Palace, so you’re not royalty 
              no matter what you think. You’re the daughter of a doctor, 
              a motel-owner, or a guy who owns a Subway, and while it’s 
              all the same thing to your daddy, it’s not to the rest of 
              the world. Reality check, please.</p>
            <p class="style19">Ladies, the overly-coy “hidden picture, please send me an 
              email and ask for my picture” functionality on some dating 
              sites is an automatic skip for many. It’s like your ancestors 
              struggled to reach the land of the free and home of the brave, only 
              to have you jump to covering your face in public. Whether you or 
              others think you’re attractive or not is less important than 
              how comfortable you are with how you look and who you are. Someone 
              out there finds you cute, trust me. Don’t get nutso about 
              it either way: “Gosh, I’m so hot!” is just as 
              bad as “God, I’m so ugly.”</p>
            <p class="style19">Men: find a decent picture of yourself <em>somewhere,</em> taken 
              in the last year. That picture of you on the college ski trip doesn’t 
              accurately reflect the beer belly you sprouted on your thirtieth, 
              and don’t think it will go <em>unnoticed</em> on your first 
              date. </p>
            <p class="style19">If someone’s profile says, "Don't write without sending 
              a picture," take it seriously. If you’re not comfortable 
              with that, for whatever reason (third arm, severe acne scarring, 
              chronic drooling), skip ahead. There is another profile after this 
              one. Really.</p>
            <p class="style19">Both genders: Do NOT reply to your ex's dating website profile. 
              This will never ever win him or her back. If this seems like a good 
              idea to you, it's really, really over. Get with the program.</p>
            <p class="style19">Everyone should just skip the “auto-reply” functions 
              some of these sites have. It’s infuriating to get an impersonal, 
              generic, and totally bland reply after going out on a limb trying 
              to contact someone you’d like to get to know better. And it’s 
              a really bad sign if your real-time replies sound like an auto-reply 
              (i.e. “Hi, I saw your profile and I would like to know you 
              better. If you would like to get to know me better, email me”). 
              Please, some wit and humor wouldn’t hurt.</p>
            <p class="style19"> <strong>Meeting the Parents:</strong><br>
              Ladies: Your parents are <em>not</em> better, no matter how much 
              you think they are. And meeting your date’s parents is not 
              a cause for massive alarm and clothes-shopping. Be yourself, and 
              hope for the best. Do not become as nutty as your potential in-laws. 
              Desis are all about the Oedipal complex. Think before you dress. 
              Nothing above the knee, show no cleavage, and absolutely, under 
              NO circumstances, are halter-tops okay. You want your potential 
              mother-in-law to think of beautiful grandchildren. You do not want 
              to become your future father-in-law's fantasy.<br>
              <br>
              Men: The parental meeting should happen within the first eight months 
              of dating, otherwise you're just leading on your significant other. 
              When meeting the parents, do <em>not</em> be yourself. Instead, 
              act like a perfect gentleman. Let your sweetie dress you and pack 
              for you, and kick you under the table to tell you to shut up immediately. 
              You'll be thankful later. If you are forced to meet the parents 
              within the first two months, you should probably reevaluate a tad. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">Both genders: After the second date, his or her family and good 
              friends are not YOUR family and good friends. Take it easy, sparky. 
              A few months later, it'll happen naturally—or not at all. 
              And no matter how bad of a cook or housekeeper you are, always offer 
              to help clean up at that first big meeting. Your significant other's 
              mother may say no, but keeping her company wins big points. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Rehashing with Friends:</strong><br>
              Ladies, this one mainly applies to you. It might be fun to analyze 
              everything your date says and does with your friends later, but 
              bear in mind that this can damage a relationship in the long run. 
              Your friends aren’t always right—sometimes you’re 
              looking for sympathy and they offer criticism that seems like what 
              you want. </p>
            <p class="style19">Men, the same holds true for you, but mainly because…well…what 
              kind of a guy are you, anyway? Your friends really don’t want 
              to hear about it. Odds are they’ve already told you so.</p>
            <p class="style19">And a general note for both genders on this topic: genuinely malevolent 
              or evil people are much rarer than anecdotal evidence would have 
              you believe. But they’re not totally extinct, either. And 
              sometimes a genuinely nice person can simply be intolerably selfish. 
              It may or may not be in your control to change their behavior, but 
              odds are that beyond a minimum of venting, revisiting the situation 
              over and over with your friends without taking corrective action 
              won’t do anything more than annoy them and make you look neurotic. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">Simply put, there’s a fine line between being careful and 
              being paranoid. It’s your job to find it. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>After You're Officially Dating:</strong><br>
              The hard part’s done. You’ve attracted someone, you 
              both like each other enough to become exclusive, and now you’re 
              “dating.” It’s all easy from here, right? Wrong, 
              Einstein. That kind of lazy thinking is why 98% of all relationships 
              end in break-ups and made-up statistics. </p>
            <p class="style19">A little preventive maintenance goes a long way. Be romantic. And 
              be romantic spontaneously and without warning. A dinner date, a 
              weekend trip, or a home-cooked candle-lit dinner will pay dividends 
              when the guy one cube down starts sending your naïve darling 
              emails saying he’s free after work or the secretary begins 
              showing an unhealthy interest in your cuddle bear’s appointment 
              book.</p>
            <p class="style19">Remember, they’re overlooking a lot of your flaws to be with 
              you. Try and reciprocate—it’s only polite.</p>
            <p class="style19">Keep your expectations low. But that doesn’t mean lowering 
              your standards! Dating means enjoying another’s company for 
              what it is, rather than what it <em>could be.</em> Focus on how 
              much you enjoy the other person’s company, not on what you 
              think he or she isn’t doing for you.</p>
            <p class="style19">And try and avoid being critical. Nagging is never a turn-on, and 
              no matter how much you think you could have done it better, it’s 
              not a good idea to share those thoughts. No. Not ever. Especially 
              if you hear one of your parents’ voices when you think those 
              thoughts. Bad idea.</p>
            <p class="style19">Ladies, you shouldn’t want to marry your dad.</p>
            <p class="style19">Men, you shouldn't want to marry your mom. </p>
            <p class="style19">All, if you think it's okay to gain ten pounds after you start 
              dating someone, you've got another think coming.</p>
            <p class="style19"> <strong>Breakup Etiquette:</strong><br>
              How you break up is maybe the most important thing, yet many people 
              think it's utterly unimportant. How you leave another person will 
              deeply affect how you both approach relationships in the future. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">Breakups are never easy. And sometimes it’s practically impossible 
              to control your emotions when you find that a relationship you’ve 
              spent a great deal of time and energy on is suddenly ending. A graceful 
              ending that brings closure to both parties and a deep and lasting 
              friendship might be an ideal beyond your reach, but there’s 
              something to be said for at least getting the “graceful” 
              part down right. Regardless of what Jerry Springer says, being cheated 
              on doesn’t entitle you to a screaming hissy fit or months 
              of stalker-like behavior; most breakups are much less melodramatic 
              than that, so try and stay grounded. In just a few months, you’ll 
              look back at the whole thing and wonder why you got so worked up, 
              so try not to embarrass yourself too badly right now (for any of 
              my exes out there reading this, well…it took me a while to 
              figure it all out, but I did. And now I’m so laid-back and 
              cool that you can’t have me. Ha!) </p>
            <p class="style19">If that’s all elementary for you, and this is one of those 
              “We tried, but it just didn’t work out, and I wish you 
              well” situations, follow it through properly to the end. Good 
              things sometimes do come from the end, so pop in your <em>Lion King</em> 
              DVD and hum along to “The Circle of Life.” Something 
              good will be along soon, even if it doesn’t really feel like 
              it at the moment. Now you’re single again, which is hardly 
              the disaster your parents make it out to be. You’re a little 
              older and hopefully a little wiser. To the <em>right</em> person, 
              this will only make you more attractive, so stick to your guns, 
              hold your standards and your head up high, be patient and try to 
              have <strong>fun.</strong> The rest will fall into place on its 
              own! </p>
            <p class="style19"> <strong>The…Other…Ending:</strong><br>
              My god, you’ve killed her. Dump the body in the river, steal 
              your roommate’s license plates, and head for the Mexican border!</p>
            <p class="style19">No, not <em>that</em> ending. So you’re in love. Deeply in 
              love. Your friends hate you. You’re so in love that you get 
              weepy trying to describe it at halftime on Super Bowl Sunday. Your 
              favorite movie is now <em>Jerry Maguire,</em> and you replay the 
              “You…complete me / Shut up, you had me at hello” 
              scene eight or ten times a day. Yes! You’ve found your soulmate! 
              You’ve also made me dizzyingly nauseous, but somewhere underneath 
              my greenish-tinged skin, trust me, I’m very happy for you. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">I could go on and on, because clearly you two are going to have 
              the happiest of lives together, but how about we get to the beginning 
              of the end or maybe the end of the beginning? That’s right…The 
              Proposal.</p>
            <p class="style19">Men, this usually is all about you. It’s where you get to 
              shine or fail utterly. Done properly, your fiancé’s 
              friends, family, and even total strangers will remember you forever 
              with warm feelings. Done improperly, and the whole thing goes up 
              in smoke. Trust me, I know. </p>
            <p class="style19">Unfortunately, this is also one of those areas where there’s 
              not much I can tell you, because when it’s the right person, 
              you’ll feel inspired. You’ll know exactly what to do, 
              and it will all come together like B.A. Baracus and Hannibal wandering 
              into a barn full of farm equipment and sheet metal. Obstacles that 
              would otherwise seem insurmountable will later become humorous footnotes 
              in the Legend of Your Proposal. Your kids will one day climb upon 
              your knee and ask you to tell the story of how you tricked mommy 
              into agreeing to wash your underwear for the next 50 years, and 
              that will make it all totally worthwhile. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Epilogue:</strong><br>
              I could talk about planning weddings, the actual marriage, even 
              divorce. But why take it too far? You’ve got your whole life 
              to lead in front of you, and it just wouldn’t be seemly for 
              you to pull out a tattered printout of ABCDlady every time life 
              throws you a relationship curveball. But now you’re prepared 
              for the worst! Armed with these guidelines and your own sense of 
              humor, cunning, and creativity, you’ll do wonders. Just make 
              sure and let me know how it all works out so I can learn from your 
              example. </p>
            <p class="style19">So take it from there and…good luck! </p>
