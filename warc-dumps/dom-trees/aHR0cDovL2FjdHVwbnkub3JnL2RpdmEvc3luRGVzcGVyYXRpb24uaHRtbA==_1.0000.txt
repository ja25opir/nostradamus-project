23, 1991. <br>
Early morning protests took place downtown Manhattan with AIDS
activists protested the Government's involvement in the Gulf War
to the exclusion of vital interests at home. That afternoon--5:00
RUSH HOUR--Grand Central Station was filled with demonstrators
protesting under the banners: "Money For AIDS, Not For War"
and "One AIDS Death Every 8 Minutes".</font></p>

night before, AIDS activists disrupted the <b>CBS News Evening

"Fight AIDS, not Arabs; AIDS is news!") and the <b>MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour</b>. (Robin MacNeil: "There's been a demonstration
in our studio; it was a group of non-violent demonstrators from
ACT UP who complained that we and the media are spending too much
time and attention on the war in the Middle East which they say
will never kill as many people as are dying of AIDS and I told
them that this program has spent a lot of time on the AIDS matter
and will be covering it more in the future."</font><font color="#000000" size="+1" face="Arial">_</font><font size="+1" face="Arial">Asked by a reporter: "Don't you think this

We responded: "No, we think spending hundreds of billions
of dollars bombing people in another continent is a silly and
immature way to get a point across."</font></p>

  <p><b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">President
  Bush and Congress murdered them.</font></b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial"> Within a matter of months the U.S. Government
  is able to house, feed and provide health care for half a million
  people in the middle of the desert. But here at home, the Federal
  Government continues to routinely deny these same basic necessities
  to people living with AIDS. We wonder--as we fight a war for
  oil in the Persian Gulf--whether President Bush and Congress
  are conscious of the desperate state of the AIDS crisis in this
  country. We are. Through 10 years of this plague and 10 years
  of Republican administrations, there remains no leadership. After
  over-whelmingly (and with much fanfare) passing the C.A.R.E.
  Act (aka the Ryan White Act), Congress and President Bush failed
  to appropriate the funds necessary to implement this disaster
  relief. Why is it that when a hurricane or earthquake hits--and
  causes mostly property damage and relatively few deaths---federal
  dollars pour in? When a disease devastates whole communities
  and kills more than 110,000 men, women and children--more than
  twice the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War--our
  leaders remain silent. And you remain silent. </font><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial Black">Silence = Death</font><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">Governor Cuomo
  murdered them.</font></b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">
  In order to cope with New York State's fiscal problems, Governor
  Cuomo is attempting to balance his budget with people's lives.
  What happened to his five-year AIDS plan? New York's AIDS budget
  received few cuts, but it is simply not keeping pace with the
  epidemic. Budgets must be balanced, but not at the cost of thousands
  of New Yorkers lives. Cuomo has never declared New York State
  a disaster area. He has never personally gone to Washington to
  lobby for federal AIDS-relief funding. Mario Cuomo is governor
  of the AIDS capital of the world. His "family of New York"
  is dying. Where is the leadership New York needs to weather this
  storm? <b>President Cuomo???</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">Mayor Dinkins
  murdered them.</font></b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">
  During his successful campaign for mayor, David Dinkins made
  many promises concerning people living with AIDS. Dinkins has
  broken all of these promises, except one: Against the advice
  of every major authority on I.V. drug use and its connection
  to AIDS, Dinkins and his inept health commissioner, Woody Myers,
  scrapped the city's needle-exchange program. They ignore the
  evidence that needle exchange not only stops the spread of AIDS
  in the I.V.drug-using communities, but also acts as a bridge
  into treatment programs. I.V. drug users, their sexual partners
  and their children have the highest rate of new HIV infection.
  The cause is clear. The fix is cheap: Clean needles save lives.
  <b>Dinkins' policy is genocidal.</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">Did you murder
  them too?</font></b><font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="Arial">
  As 1 in 25 New Yorkers is infected with HIV...As more than 10,000
  people with AIDS are homeless...As our children become infected...As
  the Catholic Church continues to interfere in public-health policy...As
  promising new treatments remain unavailable...As we continue
  to die... Will you continue to do nothing?</font></p>

    <p><b><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">Money for AIDS, Not
    for War!</font></b></p>
    <p><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">As the U.S. spends tens
    of billions of dollars on a pre-emptive war in the Persian Gulf,
    we demand that this money be spent on the real national and global
    priority: HEALTHCARE!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">AIDS is the greatest global
    threat to human security that exists today. It is more deadly
    than terrorism or alleged weapons in Iraq. AIDS has already cost
    25 million lives worldwide. In Africa and Asia, whole communities
    are being wiped out and the future of entire continents are at
    risk. Around the world, and in our own country and our own cities,
    HIV infection rates continue to rise at alarming rates, particularly
    among communities of color.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">AIDS is a clear and present
    danger to all of humanity. That Healthcare and Human Rights are
    not top priorities of the U.S. government highlights the biogtry
    and hypocracy of the United States. This year, while the U.S.
    focuses on manufactered threats in Iraq and paranoid terrorist
    attacks at home, it is certain that AIDS will kill more than
    3 million people...THREE MILLION DEATHS...THIS YEAR!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">AIDS is an urgent wake-up
    call to a deeper crisis in the state of the world. The huge global
    inequalities that fuel this pandemic are de-stabilizing and they
    are deadly. Only racism has allowed the loss of so many lives
    to AIDS. Fighting a war against AIDS is the most important positive
    step toward building a stable future for everyone.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">The U.S. thinks of itself
    as the most powerful country on earth, and it has a clear choice
    to make. It can provide Healthcare to it's citizens and choose
    to provide leadership for a global effort to defeat the plague
    of AIDS and save millions of lives. Or it can choose to act arrogantly
    and unilaterally, dictating regime changes and re-drawing maps
    to serve its own narrowly defined interests. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#cccccc" face="Arial">A war on AIDS can be won.
    This must be the real priority. This is why we demand: Money
    for AIDS, Not for War!</font></p>

            Molly Ivins reminds us in <b>The Progressive</b> this month that,
            in spite of his other failings, Hermann Goering was no fool.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">While under arrest in Nuremburg
            in 1946 the Nazi leader told an interviewer, "Why of course
            the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm
            want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get
            out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?" He
            went on to insist that it was up to the leaders of every country
            and every form of government to drag the people along. Goering
            would have none of the interviewer's naive objection that in
            democracies people have a say in the matter through their elected
            representatives.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Voice or no voice, the people
              can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is
              easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked,
              and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing
              the country to danger. It works the same in any country.</font></p></blockquote>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Ivins recognizes how conflicted
            many Americans are now that "ghastly conflict" in Iraq
            is underway, but she offers encouragement to those who persevere
            in protesting the deadly policies of the regime in Washington.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Speak up, speak out, but never
              let anyone else define what you think--including the President.
              It is never "My country, right or wrong." As the Radical
              Republican Senator <b>Carl Schurz</b> of Missouri once put it,
              "Our country, right or wrong. When right, to be kept right;
              when wrong, to put right."<br>
