<p>I have never purchased tires online before but after dealing with "Buy Tires
Online" I would not hesitate to buy from they again as the service was
brilliant. The price was great, communication was fast and clear, the entire
process was painless and hassle free. I went online and ordered the tires in
the morning, received an email straight back confirming the order had been
placed and by that afternoon I had the tires delivered to my door. I will
definitely by buying my next set of tires from them as I can see no reason why
I would go back to dealing with a tire shop after getting such a good deal and
service from "Buy Tires Online". Marc</p>

<p>By chance I came across Buy Tyres Online while searching the internet and it
<br>
was a rewarding experience to be able to purchase quality premium grade
<br>
tyres for 1/2 the price I had been quoted by my local tyre retailer. My 4
<br>
wheel drive has previously two sets of tyres. Both sets proved to be very
<br>
noisy and gave a hard ride. I just can't believe how quiet these new
<br>
tyres have been and its like driving a new vehicle. The service I received
<br>
from was so good I just had to ring them up and say "thank you" and of
<br>
course I have recommended several of my friends and colleagues to Buy Tyres
<br>
Online.</p>

<p><strong>Just wanted to say thanks for the great service and hassle free
supply of the tyres for my Audi, they look great and best of all handle like a
dream. Its good to know you can actually get value for money and not get ripped
off when you try. I would recommend your business without hesitation and have
done so in the last couple of weeks</strong>

<br>
of there way to not only find them for me but had them delivered to a place
<br>
where I could pick them up, Good old fashioned customer service! Thanks

<p><strong>I was looking for some affordable tyres on the net and was
pleasantly
<br>
surprised to find a company that gave me not only a great price for my
<br>
tyres, but also fantastic and quick service. I would highly recommend buying
<br>
tyres through these guys and I will be telling everyone I know to do the
<br>
same. I look forward to doing business again in the future.</strong>

place that had Pirelli tyres at an affordable price, local tyre shop couldn't
come close. Will only buy online now at these prices.</p>
