<h2 class="title">Using FastMail.FM with Outlook 2010</h2>
<h3>What you need to know</h3>
<p>
Microsoft Outlook 2010 can easily be configured to access your FastMail.FM account.  IMAP accounts appear differently in Outlook than standard POP or Exchange accounts.  Outlook 2010 supports the ability to save items to the Sent Items folder on the server. <br><br>Outlook 2010 is the first version of Outlook that supports utilizing a Trash folder on the server.   Outlook will now behave in a similar manner to the FastMail.FM  web interface, that is, when you delete an item it will be moved from its current folder into the Trash folder.  This removes the annoying strikeout interface in Outlook.<br>
<br>
<strong>Upgrading Outlook?:</strong> The following will list the steps to setup your FastMail.FM account with Outlook 2010.   If you upgrade from a previous version of Outlook (and had already setup your FastMail.FM account) it will import your settings, you would simply have to update the Deleted Items behavior (step 14 below).<br><br>	

<b>Note:</b> If you already know how to set up your client, and you already
understand the information below, see <a href="/help/remote_email_access_server_names_and_ports.html">this help page</a>
for the server information you need to set up your e-mail client.
The <b>Troubleshooting Issues</b> section at the bottom of this page may be
helpful if you have problems.
</p><p>In order to use Outlook 2010 with FastMail.FM, you'll need to enter the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>username</b> - When you signed up for FastMail.FM, you chose a username
    which is also your e-mail address. You must use the full username, including
    the name <b>and</b> the domain part, which is the part after the '@' symbol.
    For example, a user named John Doe might have chosen a username of "johndoe@fastmail.fm". Make sure that you specify your username in lowercase only.</li>
  <li><b>password</b> - When you signed up for FastMail.FM, you chose a password
    to go along with your username. You will need the password to access your
    account. The password also keeps others from being able to access your
    e-mail. Your password is case sensitive, so be sure that you type it in
    correctly. "PASS123" is different to&nbsp; "pass123".
    Often, users forget about the CapsLock button and mistype their password.
  </li><li><b>incoming mail server (IMAP or POP)</b> - This is the server that you
    get your e-mail from. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post
    Office Protocol (POP) are retrieval methods used to move e-mail messages
    from the server to your e-mail client so that you can read your messages.
    POP access is not available for all service levels, please check the <a href="/pages/fastmail/docs/pricingtbl.html">pricing
    table</a> for details. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is available for your
    protection as well. By enabling this option, you can keep people from
    reading your e-mail as it is transmitted between the e-mail server and your
    computer.
  </li><li><b>outgoing mail server (SMTP)</b> - This is the server that sends your
    e-mail. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the method that your client
    uses to move e-mail messages from your client to the server so that it can
    send your messages. The FastMail.FM SMTP server is not available for all
    service levels, please check the <a href="/pages/fastmail/docs/pricingtbl.html">pricing
    table</a> for details. If your service level does not allow use of the FastMail.FM    SMTP server, you must use the SMTP server provided by your Internet Service
    Provider (ISP).<br>
    <br>
    The FastMail.FM&nbsp; SMTP server requires SMTP Authentication. This keeps
    people who are not users of the FastMail.FM service from using the SMTP
    server to send spam messages on the Internet. SSL is also available for the
    FastMail.FM SMTP server. If you don't
    use the FastMail.FM SMTP server, you
    may have different options or requirements. You will need to get that
    information from your ISP.</li>
</ul>

IMAP accounts appear in their own grouping within Outlook.  By default, Outlook will display a Personal Folders group (with an Inbox folder).  This is where POP accounts deliver their messages.<br>
<br>
For IMAP accounts, such as your FastMail.FM, Outlook will display your folders (and INBOX) under its own group.<br>  An example is depicted in the image below:<br>
<p><img src="images/outlook2010/7folderview.jpg" width="235" height="614">
<br>
