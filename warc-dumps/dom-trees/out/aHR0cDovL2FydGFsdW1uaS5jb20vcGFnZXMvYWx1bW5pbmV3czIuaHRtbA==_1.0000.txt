After a year studying communication design at Buffalo State College, I spent the next year at Parsons School of Design and the New School for Social Research. I started working in the Graphic design industry for a small printing company where I learned about offset colour printing and production design. I was hired to work in the Production department of a corporate Design firm: Corporate Annual Reports. After two years as Production assistant and quality control supervisor I left New York City to travel to Italy and France, visiting my Sicilian relatives in the coastal town of Trapani. On my return to Manhattan, I started my own freelance business:Promotion through Printing. Designing and quality control were my two main activities. In 1982 I opened a small dessert café on the upper west side. The Pastry Room. Which is where I met an Australian dishwasher who I married in Perth, Western Australia four years later. We became a family with the birth of our son Ben(now 19) and expanded to four when our daughter Ella (now 16) was born three years later. Perth life has suited my deep need for a peaceful and non threatening environment in which to live and raise my two children. I returned to study and complete my Bachelor of Arts degree in 1999. And will complete my final year this December of 2006. Calligraphy, Painting, and some design work have been my pursuits in the past. Painting on commission and for pure pleasure. Selling work at different private venues. Currently I am working on an installation which addresses the subject of Distance, seperation and connection. I look forward to its completion and final presentation. The years have passed and I regret none of them. I remain friends with three wonderful women from my Art and Design years. I often wonder how others in my Co-hort are doing with their lives. And was so pleased to learn of the Allumni connection.

I just reached a milestone this year.....15 yrs with the company!!!  I've done engraving for many celebrities such as Elton John, Mariah Carey, Keith Richards, Pope Benedict, and many many more.  I've also engraved the USTA trophies, the superbowl trophy ( twice ), and my personal favorite, I did a box for Prince Charles which was presented to him when he visited the Philadelphia Academy of Music commemorating their 150th anniversary.

His advice is to live each day with nothing but a positive thought, something that makes you and only you happy no matter what. And if you are from the class of 2000 and have not yet gone out and done something, anything even if it has nothing to do with Art, he suggests that you get up off your butt and do it now! It's been only two years since graduation, and you're all about 20 now, so get it together before you turn 40 and the 90's are a distant memory. God bless all of you.
