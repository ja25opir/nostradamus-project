  <p class="MsoNormal">Before I proceed to inform the American people about the dastardly
  way in which the defense contracting business rips off the government and the
  taxpayer, let me explain my credentials for this critical evaluation. I spent
  over 17 years in the defense contracting business as a draftsman, design
  engineer, supervisor, systems engineer, a manager for a major aerospace firm,
  and as the Assistant Program Manager/Proposal Manager on a multi-billion
  dollar U. S. Navy shipbuilding contract. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;
  mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I have the unique perspective that I have spent one-half
  of my professional life in defense contracting work and one-half in the
  private sector. It most certainly opens your eyes as to how projects and
  taxpayer versus consumer dollars should and should not be managed.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Defense contracting is just one aspect of Congress’ total
  disregard for taxpayer dollars. The situation can be summed up in one brief
  phrase, “The government and Congress is not accountable to the American
  people.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the defense contractors
  had to sit before an audience of a few hundred average American taxpayers to
  justify the costs of one of these obscenely inflated programs, the defense
  contractor management would be lucky if they left the room with their skin
  intact.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">My First Encounter With the Aerospace Industry</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I accepted employment for a major defense contractor in
  the early 1970s after I had been discharged from the Army. I moved to
  California to take a job with the hope of starting a new career. Working in
  California was a complete revelation to me as I had previously worked in a
  boiler room type operation in New York City. Our drawing boards were made
  from old doors. There were no frills, no air conditioning, and no “break”
  rooms; not even a coffee maker. If you had a friendly conversation that
  lasted more than 5 minutes, you were severely chastised. The environment was
  all work and no play. We quietly made jokes about the head slave master who
  beat a constant rhythm on his kettledrums to the tune of “draw, draw, draw!”
  In contrast, the “enlightened” California environment was so friendly and
  laid back. It was a refreshing change from my worker bee’s viewpoint but I
  could not envision how any work was accomplished. The sparkling new buildings
  we worked in, plus the seemingly endless flow of money, was initially refreshing
  until I examined the culture more closely.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;
  mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Before I cut any deeper, let me offer the obligatory
  apologies to the small percentage of defense workers I have had the pleasure
  to work with who actually exhibited superior work habits.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">After I had worked in California for a few months at a job
  in which chaos reigned supreme, my manager asked me if I would be interested
  in working in a new group that would attempt to automate the ship’s drawings
  via computer, since I was one of the few employees with a computer education.
  I was thrilled and accepted immediately. My company had hired McDonnell
  Douglas Automation in Long Beach, California to get the ball rolling. Today
  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a household word in the engineering community,
  but in those days it was non-existent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I visualized myself working on the cutting edge of technology. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Another employee and I were sent to McDonnell-Douglas
  Automation on a fact-finding mission. We were greeted by a manager and
  escorted through the main engineering room to a conference room. This massive
  room must have held 200 drawing boards. I could not help but notice that only
  one board was occupied by an engineer who was actually working. The rest of
  the employees were standing around the coffee machine or just chatting away
  in the hallways. I asked the manager if we had interrupted the engineers
  while they were on coffee break. He gave me a quizzical look and stated that
  “No, it was just the normal workday.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This was my introduction to the California defense contracting
  business. I should note that when I left the facility, I believe I saw three
  people with their noses down on the drawing board – a vast improvement.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Now I know that the California work environment has been
  dubbed “manana” (tomorrow) in Spanish, but I could not believe that this work
  attitude I was witnessing was the norm. I would be proven wrong. The defense
  aerospace industry has degenerated into the largest Works Progress
  Administration (WPA) program in American history rife with inefficiency
  usurping any of the programs initiated by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which
  I’m sure were a model of efficiency in comparison. The sloppy work habits all
  started during World War II when the government threw its entire resources
  into building fighter aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost
  was not the issue – just get the planes built – which leads to unacceptable
  inefficiencies in personnel and processes.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;
  mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Don’t Work Too Hard</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I can recall a conversation I had with an associate who
  was literally in fear for his life. He was a very aggressive worker who was
  raised to believe that hard work found it’s own rewards, whether that was in
  the form of monetary remuneration or the satisfaction of a job well done. He
  had been on the job only a few months when he was approached by a vigilante
  committee of fellow workers,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>who
  subtly let him know that he was causing problems in the workforce. They
  informed him that he was working too hard making them look bad to management,
  and that he should adjust his schedule and work habits “to slow down a
  bit.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They did not threaten him with
  any physical violence but the pure intimidation of the group of highly
  educated “thugs” put fear in his heart. He soon discovered he had little
  choice as he felt that Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves were now watching his
  every action. As I recall, he soon found other employment outside of defense
  work.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Make A Living on the Taxpayers</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">One of the most startling discoveries I made in my first
  few years was that many of my associates all seemed to run businesses on the
  side during our normal 9 to 5 work day. One friend was buying up old houses,
  accomplishing a few necessary repairs, and then renting the houses out to
  tenants. This was all before the California real estate boom of the 1970s
  when real estate could still be purchased for a song. I’m sure he’s a
  millionaire today, by employing the tried and true spirit of applying
  American enterprise at taxpayer’s expense. Where did these employees find the
  time to spend on all of the phone calls and visits, you might ask? Since the
  organization was terribly fragmented (with thousands of employees working on
  a single project) and most of the managers incompetent, I would estimate that
  the average low-level employee worked 2 hours per day for 8 hours of pay. Now
  I know that aerospace managers who read this book will retort, “That attitude
  was in the old days,” but I still have friends in the industry who confirm
  for me that the situation is still as bad or even worse today. The sad part
  of this situation is that the average defense worker does not understand how
  the “real world” functions, believing that they put in an honest day’s work,
  as many of these employees have never worked outside of that industry.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Cost Plus Contracts</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Often, the government negotiates “cost plus” contracts with
  defense contractors instead of fixed price contracts, as the costs of some
  projects cannot reasonably be determined at the start of a complex project.
  Government representatives negotiate a set of predetermined costs for all
  efforts reflecting the acceptable labor rate for engineers or managers, the
  overhead rate, etc., and then include a profit of let’s say 7%. Then the
  contractor simply collects the hours worked, adds all of the fudge factors
  including the profit and bills the government. It would seem that you can’t
  get rich on a profit of 7%, but defense contracting firms quickly realized
  that they could make the bottom line much juicier when they could justify
  10,000 employees on a project instead of the 1,000 employees that were
  necessary to realistically complete the job with a lot less communication
  problems, I might add.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">During the process of developing a new design, when
  various options existed in materials or equipment, I don’t think I ever heard
  the term “cost effective” used in conversation. Money was no matter. Only the

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Escaping To the Private Sector</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When I finally left the defense business in disgust after
  17 years to accept a job as a Director of Data Processing for a major food
  processing company in California, I was not prepared for the reality that
  awaited me. After watching huge outlays of money for seemingly idiotic
  expenses in defense work, I can recall being called on the carpet by the
  quintessential “old man” who ran the company because he took issue with a $15
  subscription I had approved for a computer trade journal, even though my
  budget was a few million dollars per year. I quickly altered all of my
  attitudes about money just to survive in the commercial sector. The people in
  my department worked their tails off, too. It was not unusual for everyone to
  work 18-hour days just to get the job done – something I had rarely witnessed
  in defense work. In addition, I was running a small computer department of
  less than 30 people, but I had complete control of the efforts of this
  Fortune 1000 company as opposed to being some small cog trying to fight an
  uphill battle on a meaningless project consisting of 10,000 or 20,000 people
  who often worked against each other to achieve political gain. My small group
  was the essence of America. The environment was challenging and invigorating.
  I enjoyed working 18 hours per day as opposed to being one of the
  clock-watchers in the defense business who counted the seconds until it was
  Miller Time. True incentive is squelched in defense work, as your role is so
  insignificant that your achievements can only be measured in tiny incremental
  steps.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">The Bradley Death Trap</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Many of us have probably watched the made-for-TV movie,
  “The Pentagon Wars”, in which the costs (over $14 billion) of developing the Bradley
  Fighting Vehicle for the U. S. Army skyrocketed totally out of control. Air
  Force Lt. Col. John Burton was assigned to evaluate the usefulness of the
  Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, an Army troop carrier/scout vehicle that
  was in reality a deathtrap for its crew. Burton kept trying to prove whether
  it was an effective weapon and safe for its crew, but he was constantly
  harassed by his temporary commanding officer, an Army General, so this
  individual could get the Bradley into production and then into the field
  after years of foot dragging by all involved. Through chicanery and backdoor
  politics, the Colonel was finally able to demonstrate the problems with the
  design, to no avail. When the Israeli Army purchased the vehicle, they made
  all of the changes recommended by the Colonel. Unfortunately, this is not an
  isolated incidence. In blunt terms, there is no accountability for taxpayer’s
  money – there is only accountability through the political chain of command.
  To spend $14 billion to continuously STUDY one weapons system is outrageous.
  On top of that, the vehicle has the complexity of a can opener. With that
  huge expenditure of money, they should have had thousands of the vehicles in
  the field plus they should have found the cure for cancer. Do you think this
  stupidity would have been permitted in the private (commercial) sector?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More heads would have rolled then in the
  French Revolution. Oh, yes, I believe the Army General responsible for this
  fiasco was promoted immediately after this incident. Makes sense to me.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">As a much smaller example of typical government
  procurement costs, most of us have heard about the government spending $700
  to purchase a toilet seat. In actuality, it was not a toilet seat; <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the item was a molded fiberglass
  cover for the sanitary tank on a P-3 aircraft with a toilet seat molded into
  the cover. In this one case, the price is not quite as preposterous as we
  first thought, so it was not a good example of failings of the bureaucracy.</span><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But let’s
  understand a few basic principles of military procurement. Government rarely
  has the opportunity to purchase their hardware and equipment from Joe’s
  Hardware Store. In the first place, many of the equipment items are only used
  on missiles, aircraft or ships or by the armed forces in the field. Military
  equipment, whether it is a jet engine or only small screws, has to pass
  certain tests that would never be necessary in the commercial sector. For
  example, even little screws must be shock tested so if a rocket explodes near
  an aircraft the equipment held by these screws doesn’t come flying off of the
  bulkhead decapitating a crewmember. </span><span style="font-size:9.0pt;
  mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Under
  procurement regulations, a Request For Quote (RFQ) is submitted to three
  qualified bidders before the purchase is awarded. The concept of three
  bidders is designed to avoid nepotism wherein their pals get rich from
  fulfilling all of the contracts. A package is prepared containing the
  description and quantity desired for the item, the applicable military
  specification that defines the requirements for the item in excruciating
  detail, delivery schedule, and any software requirements (material
  composition, shock testing, etc.) that define the paper work that must be
  submitted with the hardware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now the
  time required of the prime contractor plus the labor and material costs for
  the subcontractor to fulfill the order leaps astronomically just to procure a
  few screws. Let’s be honest. Some of this meticulous preparation is necessary
  to ensure a weapons system that will perform as designed. However,
  innumerable changes can be made in this process to drastically lower the
  costs of procurement. For example, eliminate the requirement for multiple
  bidders on purchases less than $1,000. When Al Gore was Vice-President, he
  elected to tackle the procurement bureaucracy to effect change. The last
  thing I remember was Al Gore putting his tail between his legs and running
  for cover.</span><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">When I was the Assistant Program Manager, one of my
  primary responsibilities was to act as liaison with the U.S. Navy, which
  required that I interface with virtually every department within the shipyard
  consisting of over 5,000 employees. These departments included estimating,
  engineering, material control, procurement, accounting and contracts
  administration. I had a very unique situation rarely enjoyed by the vast
  majority of defense contracting employees, as I had a ringside seat to the
  circus that was unfolding. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">The majority of large-scale defense procurement items go
  through a competitive bidding process often involving two or more prime
  contractors. The government sends out Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
  stipulating the requirements for a new weapons system to multiple bidders.
  Generally, these requirements are in the form of a “performance”
  specification to avoid specific details that are better placed at the
  discretion of the contractor, if for no other reason to avoid cost extras at
  a later date if any changes are necessary. By performance specification, this
  term means that the government stipulates the parameters by which the new
  system must function, such as it must fly at the speed of Mach 2 at 50,000
  feet, carry a bomb load of 10,000 pounds, and have at least one toilet seat.
  The potential bidders then submit a truckload of documents justifying their
  proposal. The process in actuality is really quite simple in concept. By
  soliciting multiple bids, hopefully the government will get the most bang for
  its buck. Generally, the low bidder is awarded the contract assuming they can
  theoretically guarantee the government that they will satisfy the performance
  specifications, unless of course political considerations impact the decision
  process, as in “My brother-in-law Bernie needs the work.”<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Wingless Aviation lost the bid, half of their staff then updates their
  resumes, spit shine their shoes and go galloping off for an interview with
  the winner, Politically Connected Aviation. This is how it works in the
  defense business, with worker bees moving from one defense contractor to
  another just to survive. And often the winning and losing companies may be
  thousands of miles apart, forcing these pathetic souls to move their families

  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Find Those Costly Errors!</b> - I was a part of the
  proposal team for a new class of Amphibious Assault or helicopter assault
  ships (LHA). After Litton Industries was awarded the contract to build the
  ships, I can vividly recall that 30 or so people I worked with were yanked
  from the primary jobs and merged into a new group that you might assume was
  created to refine the design or start the process of ordering equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No, the purpose was far more sinister.
  Their function was to immediately start the process of finding the gaffes in
  the drawings and design specifications, so they could nail the government for
  more money. Normally, in most morally bound commercial environments in which
  I have worked, when problems were discovered and no work around could be
  found, then and only then was the customer asked for more money. But not in
  defense work – stick it to Joe and Mary Taxpayer within days after contract

  have to remember that in government bureaucracy the main arbiters of the
  money are auditors who knew nothing of the technical scope of the proposal.
  Without getting too in-depth into how these proposals were priced, it isn’t a
  simple matter of just telling the government that the screws cost $500 and
  the labor (because so many departments were affected by the change) was
  another $50,000. No, no, it deliberately gets much more involved then that.
  You have to add in factors such as the burden rate and the overhead, formally
  known as General and Administrative (G &amp; A). Overhead, which includes
  company-wide costs such as security services and printing costs that are
  evenly distributed throughout the company, is then calculated as a uniform
  percentage and added onto the bottom line of every proposed change. This
  proposal is submitted to a technical government representative who says “yes”
  or “no” as to the validity of the change.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">I can recall a specific incident wherein the government
  auditors were challenging the company on the pricing of a number of
  proposals. Since the auditors were not engineers and therefore not
  technically competent, when they reviewed the proposals they rarely could
  challenge the need for 4 screws, 2 widgets and 17 gotchas – all very
  complicated stuff. So human nature dictates that they would find their
  comfort zone and challenge the percentages used for the contractual labor
  rate or the overhead rate. Numbers they could understand – for after all, they
  were accountants. Many hours were spent debating whether the overhead rate
  was .07654 or .07655 percent. Rarely was the basic premise challenged about
  the screws costing $50,000, so if you multiply .07654 or .07655 times $50,000
  instead of the contractor charging the government the actual cost of a few
  thousand dollars, the resulting difference between these rates was a trifle.
  But it made the government auditors pound their chests in triumph for they
  believed they had won the battle. The axiom about the forest and the trees
  immediately comes to mind.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">The B-2 Bomber – The Ultimate Boondoggle</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Once again the government lets defense contractors dictate
  the price of weapons systems at any cost to the taxpayer. The relatively new
  B-2 Bomber has a price tag of about $2 billion per copy. Original estimates
  projected a cost of $270 million per plane. According to the Bulletin of
  Atomic Scientists, “the plane is currently worth five times its weight in
  gold.” Are we crazy to let this ridiculous pricing happen without screaming
  and shouting?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, the head of
  the U.S. Air Force responded with the typical quote to justify outlandish
  expenditures, “Its worth every penny if we save one American life.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Saving American lives is not the issue –
  this is typical military subterfuge - the issue is why do we need to waste
  incredible sums of money on very questionable, or in some cases, very badly
  conceived and wasteful projects. Oh yes, we were force fed the propaganda
  about its infinitesimally small radar signature due to its revolutionary
  shape, which of course is really just an advancement on the “Flying Wing”
  invented by Northrup Corporation in the 1950’s. The reason for the B-2 bomber
  was to avoid the radar systems so we could bomb the hell out of our
  archenemy, the Soviet Union, which no longer exists. Now I guess we can use
  these planes to bomb the border with Mexico to stifle illegal immigration.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">After spending gazillions of dollars to develop this
  state-of-the-art aircraft, the designers have the gall to tell us that
  because of the very expensive materials used to deflect the enemy’s radar,
  the plane must be housed in climate-controlled hangars and have become a
  maintenance nightmare. This pathetic solution would only be permitted in
  defense work. In private industry, the manager would soon be sweeping floors
  if he had the audacity to suggest that design even in jest. On top of that,
  rumors were flying that the B-2 melted in water. The Air Force actually flew
  a busload of newsmen to its base in Missouri so these people could watch Air
  Force personnel wash the planes. Under actual battle conditions, of course,
  the enemy would never realize that simply bombing the aircraft hangars
  immobilizes the entire fleet. It becomes painfully obvious that’s why the Air
  Force stationed the B-2 in Missouri, the geographical heartland of the
  country. I can just see it now - all of the air conditioning technicians will
  need secret clearances just to adjust the thermostat in the hangar. You would
  not believe the justification that the Air Force uses for continuation of the
  B-2 program. It’s so preposterous that you would need to wash my mouth out

  power of the U. S. Air Force. The Air Force’s command of the skies is
  unchallenged. Just like the B-2 Bomber, the Raptor is designed to avoid enemy
  radar and to shoot down Russian fighters. The plane has the ability to not
  only drop smart bombs but it also can capture enemy intelligence as it flies
  at well over 1,000 miles per hour. I wonder if it performs well in the rain?<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The F/A-22 project was conceived as a “cost plus”
  contract, which roughly translated means “milk the taxpayers,” because Joe
  and Mary Taxpayer pay for all cost overruns. Why is this contract still
  roaring ahead full bore? That’s because the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin,
  managed to find 1,000 different contractors to provide parts in 43 different
  states to share in the kill. The Congressmen and Congresswomen who approve a
  contract of this magnitude are all too eager to claim they were responsible
  for bringing the work to their district.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">The plan is to procure 277 planes at a total cost of $71.8
  billion. Twenty years ago, the Air Force planned to build 760 Raptors at a
  cost of $35 million per plane. Ten years ago, the proposal changed to 438,
  then 339 and eventually to the 277 planes at $351 million each today.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">One of the reasons cited for the huge increase in cost is
  because the plane’s avionics, designed to sight an enemy aircraft far beyond
  the pilot’s field of vision, “did not work as planned and it took us a while
  to figure out,” according to Lockheed-Martin. For the costs of the program to
  escalate so phenomenally, Lockheed-Martin must have 10,000 people working 24
  hours a day to figure out that little problem.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">The C-17 – Another Bomber Fiasco</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The C-17 AirLifter is the latest addition to the U. S. Air
  Forces global airlift capability. The C-17 was preceded by the C5A, one of
  the most scandalous programs in government procurement history. But I won’t
  delve into that program, as it would take another book to explain that
  ultimate mismanagement. The C-17 is a four-engine cargo jet that can land on
  short landing strips in remote parts of the world and drop airborne troops.
  Since the day the contract was originally awarded to McDonnell-Douglas, it
  was plagued by technical ineptness and cost overruns. In 1994, the Pentagon
  put McDonnell-Douglas on probation due to flaws in the design and postponed
  the program. In fact, McDonnell-Douglas performed so badly (that’s saying
  something for a defense contractor) that they were taken over by Boeing.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The C-17 program has so many perverted twists that it’s
  virtually impossible to list them all in this limited space. In many ways, it
  almost makes the B-2 Bomber look like the picture of management perfection.
  One item stands out like a sore thumb. The former top Air Force acquisition
  official, Darleen Druyun, who is often referred to as the “Godmother of the
  C-17,” accepted an executive position with Boeing after she was instrumental
  in redirecting the Pentagon’s acquisition of the C-17 aircraft. It should be
  mentioned that Boeing hired two of her relatives during the negotiation
  period. She was convicted in April 2004 of a Federal conspiracy charge when
  she told Boeing that their prime competitor, Airbus, underbid them by
  billions of dollars for the refueling tanker lease-purchaser agreement,
  offering the company an opportunity to resubmit their bid.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Oversight, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">from 1999-2002, there have

  <h3>Marines Deploy Disastrous V-22 Osprey Hybrid Aircraft to Iraq</h3>
  <p class="Newsletter">The V-22 Osprey, half airplane and half helicopter, has
  been under development by the Marines Corp for what seems 10,000 years, because
  they are unable to make it work satisfactorily in a combat situation.</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">Even though it is recognized by many experts that the entire
  program is unworkable, the Marines, who have already spent over $20 billion
  in development, and plan to spend $54.6 billion on acquisition, keep pushing
  the program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t bother the
  Marines that the V-22 costs three times as much as a modern helicopter and
  almost as much as a fighter jet, but who cares, it’s only taxpayer money.</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">As of April 2007, they plan to deploy the V-22 to Iraq
  with severe limitations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="Newsletter">To-date, testing of the V-22 has resulted in the deaths
  of 30 civilian test pilots and Marines in three test flight crashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many more have been involved in less
  catastrophic incidents including fires, stalled engines and software snafus.</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">The idea of the aircraft is that it will replace the
  Vietnam-era helicopters many Vietnam veterans will always remember that were
  used to ferry troops into combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  C-46 and “Huey” helicopters were easily shot down (over 5,000 lost in
  Southeast Asia) but at least had the ability to make erratic moves to quickly
  get out of harm’s way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The simple
  idea for the V-22 aircraft is that it can ferry troops into combat and speed
  away before being shot down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that’s
  not reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The plane is so badly
  designed that the Marines Corp has placed severe limitations on its use in
  combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="Newsletter">One of the major problems is that prop wash can cause the
  V-22 to roll over and head into the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>So when the plane is used in Iraq, pilots cannot exceed 9 miles per
  hour and land in a straight line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  will take Al-Qaeda about 15 minutes to learn how to shoot down the aircraft
  just like the traps that were laid by the Viet Cong for the Huey’s in
  Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The downdraft is so strong that
  it can create “brownout” conditions, making it difficult for pilots to see
  and potentially knock down Marines on the ground.</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">Critics point out that in the heat of battle, V-22 pilots
  will forget about the severe limitations and react in ways that will crash
  the hybrid bird.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A report by the
  Center for Defense Information stated, “<span style="background:#E0E0E0">The
  V-22 cannot do radical evasive maneuvers, but that’s what it will need for
  combat</span>.”</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">The Marines, apparently defying all reasonable tests of logic,
  cite that the V-22 can fly twice as fast as the C-46 helicopter that it is
  replacing, can carry three times the payload; is six times more survivable;
  and is quieter than a conventional helicopter which can be heard for miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the V-22 has many very basic design
  flaws that prohibit its usefulness. Safety is one issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 24 troops it is designed to carry
  would all drown if the V-22 went down in water because egress is very
  limited. If it loses power below 1,600 feet, the aircraft becomes a coffin
  for the occupants.</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">The bottom line is that when on duty in Iraq, the Marines
  will use the V-22 to ferry troops from one safe location to another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it’s an incredibly
  expensive truck.</p>
  <p class="Newsletter">Why are the Marines and Bush administration still pushing
  this program?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Boeing Company and
  Bell Helicopter Textron are the main contractors (let us not forget about
  their generous campaign contributions).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The work on the program, although very inefficient and prohibitively costly,
  is spread over 40 states and 2,000 subcontractors.<span style="mso-spacerun:
  yes">&nbsp; </span>More than 100 members of Congress formed a Tiltrotor Technology
  Coalition to protect the program.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When Marines start dying in Iraq because of the
  aforementioned problems, we’ll hear lots of flimsy excuses for their deaths,
  but the reality is the program should be cancelled.</p>

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Boeing Strikes Again</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">As a part of Homeland Security, the Transportation
  Security Agency (TSA) awarded a contract in 2003 to Boeing Corp. to install
  7,000 explosive detection devices at 429 commercial airports in a 7-month
  time frame around the country. The original contract was for $508 million but
  TSA made 54 changes (probably relatively minor at that) to the contract that
  raised the final price to $1.2 billion with 18 months to accomplish the work
  – par for the course in government work. Remember my previous references

  <p class="MsoNormal">If you think my previous statements about the work habits

  scrutinize the government-funded National Aeronautics and Space

  the typical aerospace work environment.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">NASA is a prime example of a government entity that
  received too much money, which I’m sure every NASA official will dispute to
  his or her dying days. NASA spent over $1 million to develop an instrument
  that would write in space, I assume something akin to a ballpoint type pen.
  The Russians, who in comparison have a pittance to spend on space, use a
  pencil at a cost of $.04.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">A little history is in order. When the Russians orbited
  the first satellite, Sputnik, in 1957, it rattled the very core of our
  defense establishment. How could the Russians have achieved this breakthrough
  over the Americans? When John F. Kennedy assumed the office of President in
  1960, he stated we would land on the moon before the decade was out – we’ll
  show those pesky Russians a thing or two. Our pride was wounded, so now it
  was time to let out all of the stops. Was there any real concern of national
  security to engage in a hastily prepared contest with the Russians to get to
  the moon? Not really. The major peripheral benefit was scientific in nature
  so we could learn how to fly in space to gain knowledge about our solar
  system, but more importantly to salvage our pride. Knowledge is always
  beneficial, but to throw billions of dollars at the problem was insane,
  especially when you consider the problems we still have on the earth with
  poverty, illiteracy and disease. What happened to our priorities in society? <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  cheers from the peoples of the world. We went back a few more times, found
  out the moon was NOT made of cheese, and that was the end of those trips. It
  was time to go after bigger targets like Venus and Mars. We of course learned
  much about space travel during that time that would make it so much easier
  for deeper ventures into the solar system in the future. Well, at least

  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Space Shuttle</b> – The Space Shuttle has been an
  unmitigated disaster since its inception. Two shuttles, Challenger and
  Columbia, have blown up with the tragic loss of two crews of 14 highly
  trained people. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Columbia accident investigators attributed the disaster to
  the NASA work environment and a lax safety culture, and they recommended 15
  reforms that must be carried out before the shuttle can fly again. To-date,
  NASA claims to have implemented changes to satisfy 5 of those
  recommendations. I assume we should not hold our breath waiting for the rest
  of the changes.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Keeping par with the defense industry, each shuttle costs
  about $2 billion. Is this a magic number the defense contractors use to price
  B-2 bombers, space shuttles and aircraft carriers? The space shuttle program,
  which began in 1972, was supposed to cost between $10 and $12 million for
  each shuttle launch, which somehow escalated to over $450 million. And the
  turnaround time between flights, which was supposed to be days, somehow
  became months, if launches were attempted at all.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">At least someone is solving the problem but not in
  government. In September 2004, a bunch of comparatively rank amateurs
  launched SpaceShipOne, a vehicle that can orbit the planet. Each launch is
  realistically predicted to cost between $25 and $30 million. At about the
  same time, the president’s space commission recommended that NASA get out of
  the business of hauling cargo into space and leave it to private enterprise.
  Within a few years no doubt, hopefully the same commission will recommend
  that private enterprise handle interplanetary exploration as well.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Climate Orbiter neared the red planet, after traveling 121 million miles for
  over 9 months, it received instructions from earth to fire its main engine to
  begin the process of orbiting around the planet. It executed the software command,
  fired its engines and fell into an orbit around the planet. But it never came

  <p class="MsoNormal">$230 million was spent to build and launch the spacecraft
  that was designed to orbit the planet and collect data on the daily weather
  and atmospheric conditions, and then transmit that data to the Mars Polar

  </span>NASA, after intensive investigation, concluded that a catastrophic
  error had occurred in the software that placed the spacecraft much too close
  to the surface of Mars. Instead of orbiting at 125 miles above the planet,
  the vehicle dropped down to 35 miles. Computer simulations verified that the
  spacecraft likely wound up as fireball lighting up the Martian atmosphere,
  but we couldn’t see it – it was on the other side of the planet. The $230
  million investment was now a junkyard sale all over the Martian landscape.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mars Spirit Rover</b> – In 2004, the Mars Spirit Rover
  landed on the planet, moved off its landing pad, began transmitting data to
  the earth, and then went silent. Another software problem was found to be the
  culprit. During the flight to Mars, NASA decided to upload a spanking new
  operating system (just like in a Personal Computer) to fix vulnerable
  shortcomings in the original operating system. But they made a primitive
  error that left some of the old programming code still active.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Here’s the nail in the coffin for this outrageous project.
  They could not have the capsule accomplish a conventional parachute landing,

  impact upon landing. So what did the geniuses at NASA decide?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They opted to have some Hollywood stunt
  men fly helicopters to snatch the capsule out of the air with hooks assuring
  a soft recovery. The pilots had participated in dozens of practice runs but –
  whoops - the spacecraft was tumbling to earth instead of the smooth descent
  if the parachute had opened as planned. They were unable to retrieve the
  capsule resulting in a smorgasbord of metal buried in the ground. NASA has
  stated that they were able to recover some material from the now obliterated
  disks, but scientists had planned to study the material for 5 years. Most
  likely, they now have about a week’s work. Instead of using hooks to snag the
  capsule, the American public would have been better off if the stunt men had
  used butterfly nets to snag the NASA managers.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Final Thoughts on NASA</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">According to General Chuck

  a tendency not to let loose of operational programs and keep on doing
  research and development. The shuttle is a good example. We could probably
  run the shuttle program for about one-tenth of what it is costing today with
  a good civilian organization that’s in it to make a profit.”</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Note General Yeager’s comment about a “good civilian
  organization,” and I don’t believe he was referring to one of the prime
  defense contractors who milk the taxpayers, either.<span style="font-size:

  fiscal year 2005 has just been increased to $16.4 billion as I complete this
  book. I strongly suggest that they give us that money back in tax cuts until
  NASA cleans its house and gets rid of the incompetent management team and
  makes every effort to change it’s culture. Perhaps we could follow the
  Russian practice and put a few of these rogues into Lubyanka Prison in Moscow
  for 10 to 20 years. Maybe that drastic approach would shake up the snake pit.

  <p class="MsoNormal">My intent was not to attack a specific government
  contractor, as Halliburton has been beaten to death in the press. In my
  experience many of these companies are all equally guilty of inept management,
  gigantic cost overruns and unjustifiable expenses. However, Halliburton has
  constantly been in the news because of their exceptional greed and

  <p class="MsoNormal">Most of the contracts Halliburton has obtained from the
  government have been sole source procurement, without a competitive bidding
  process. Since the invasion of Iraq, Halliburton has seen their share of the
  pie increase from $468 million to $3.92 billion (the government authorized
  $30 billion in emergency money to fight terrorism), no doubt because of
  certain influences in the White House.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoNormal">$1.8 billion lost in the paper work?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We’re not talking about losing track of
  $3.14. Can you imagine running any business when you really don’t know why or
  with whom you spent that kind of money?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It’s obvious that none of these clowns have ever worked in the private
  sector. This is pure, unadulterated nonsense. When they spend that kind of
  money there must be a paper trail in the form on invoices and checks, unless
  the money was handed out in the form of cash. But that’s another issue worthy
  of an in-depth investigation.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">In 1997, KBR billed the government for sheets of plywood
  at $85.98 that actually cost $14.06 for work they did in the Balkans, plus
  they billed to have their offices cleaned 4 times a day. The DCAA has charged
  Halliburton for overcharging for fuel, food and other services they have
  provided in Iraq, while the Justice Department is investigating business
  activities they had in Nigeria and Iran. The Army paid KBR $750,000 for work
  at a Fort Ord in California that cost about $125,000. What other mastodon
  skeletons are hidden in the closet?<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">Supposedly, the government is considering withholding
  payments until Halliburton gets its act together. Considering withholding
  payments? If this were the commercial sector, these guys would have been
  kicked out the door a long time ago.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <p class="MsoNormal">So it doesn’t seem that I’m kicking only one subcontractor
  in the teeth, how about Custer Battles, another contractor which provides
  services in Iraq?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two managers inside
  the company wrote memos exposing fraudulent billing practices, including
  charges for nonexistent services or services provided at grossly inflated
  prices. On top of that, former employees of the company are suing the company
  for charging the Iraqi Coalition Authority $157,000 for a $95,000 helicopter
  landing pad. Even better then that, they repainted a few forklifts, which had
  been abandoned by Iraqi Airlines, and then charged the authority thousands of
  dollars a month to lease those same forklifts. But the Pentagon has shown it
  has some backbone and is withholding $10 million in payments. They actually
  have barred the company from future contracts. I hope we can say with
  confidence that this is Custer’s Last Stand.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;

  <p class="MsoNormal">I wish to point out that it makes no difference which
  political party controls the White House or Congress. The defense procurement
  apparatus just keeps rolling along.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Incestuous Relationships</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">One of the most malignant situations that occur in the
  incestuous relationship between the government and contractors is that many
  retired military officers and contracting authorizing personnel immediately
  take high-level positions with contractors upon retirement. There is some
  merit in this approach as who knows better about the workings of the
  government then former officers, but the question must be asked, “What
  benefit did these people provide to their new company while they were still
  on active duty?”<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Why in reality one of these contractors would want to hire
  the people who are equally guilty of the mismanagement of taxpayer dollars is
  beyond my comprehension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
  hiring occurs for no other reason then to exploit their contacts and
  knowledge of government bureaucracy.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
  12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Rarely Do Systems Work</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Do you remember that during the first Gulf War, the
  outlandish claims about the kill ratio of the Patriot Missile System, when
  the generals were claiming that it had nearly a 100% kill ratio?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the war, it was proven that the
  system was a dismal failure. How can this be?<span style="font-size:9.0pt;
  mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">As another example, take the Antimissile System, which has
  been under development while a number of administrations have changed hands.
  According to the systems developer, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), the
  system may be capable of hitting targets up to 80% of the time. The system is
  designed to send interceptors into space to KO enemy warheads. It’s just
  another drop in the proverbial bucket, but the government has spent over $130
  billion on this latest venture into the Twilight Zone. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Flight tests, to determine if the thing actually works,
  have been delayed several times. It doesn’t take a brain trust to know with
  each passing day more and more is being spent with each delay because the government
  pays for these delays – not the contractor. These tests started in 1999 (5
  years ago) with the accustomed failures that led to months of delay until the
  failure point could be determined. Five hits were recorded in these tests,
  but under very “controlled conditions.” As a final blow, the Operational Test
  and Evaluation Office has had prolonged arguments with the developer, MDA,
  over the likely effectiveness of the missile system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’ll bet the kill rate will be great as
  long as it doesn’t rain.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The most ironic part of this total incompetence is the
  fact that I have often heard company management officials use the empty line,
  “If you want it to work the first time, it’s going to cost a lot of money.”
  Since systems rarely work the first time out of the barn, then obviously we,
  the taxpayers, are wasting our money. I wonder, “Can we ask for a refund?”<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Re-Thinking Weapon Systems</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It has been my observation that these systems are far too
  complicated. Some bureaucrat sits in an office in Washington and says, “Gee,
  wouldn’t it be great if the XYZ Missile could do loop-de-loops while in
  flight to confuse the enemy. Let’s add it to the contract.” By my experience,
  the official makes this decision without the slightest concept of how
  difficult that afterthought will be to implement or how much money that
  unnecessary extra may cost. For after all, the money isn’t coming out of his
  or her pocket. The military uses the standard byline, “We need it to defend
  the country,” to justify any outrageous expense. My response to that is
  “malarkey.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no analysis of
  Return on Investment (ROI) as is regularly practiced in the commercial world,
  but a reasonable approach would be to design ten relatively simple weapon
  systems with slightly less capability than one weapon system they can’t get
  to work. In conjunction with that revised design philosophy we should demand
  accountability for our monies and an honest days work from the defense
  contractors.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <h3 style="line-height:normal">Keeping Track of Inventory</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Over the years, the government has procured billions of
  items that are spread throughout the world. Supply Sergeants are responsible
  to keep track of the inventory when an item is moved from point A to point B,
  but sometimes an item becomes lost in transit. We can’t expect the Pentagon
  to keep track of every little item, but somehow the Pentagon has lost track
  of over $1 trillion (that’s trillion, not billion) dollars worth of
  inventory, and we’re not talking about socks and razor blades either. We’re
  talking about large ticket items like tanks, missiles and planes. The U. S.
  Army alone can’t find 56 planes, 32 tanks and 36 Javelin missile command
  launch units. I wonder if the Navy is missing any ships? But there is a
  degree of continuity. The Defense Department has failed its annual audit for
  seven years running. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">With just a little expeditious application of practical
  management principles to scrutinize the pricing offered by these defense
  contractors, and limiting the features that are integrated into the designs,
  the Army, Air Force and Marines could have two or three times as many of each
  weapon system to defend the country. <span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
  12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In the limited space I allocated to digest the defense
  contracting business, I was only able to whet your appetite as to the gigantic
  waste of taxpayer dollars. I can assure you there’s plenty more in Housing,
  Education and Welfare, Agriculture, and other departments, as well.<span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
