EN">Legend has it that John Mark, one-time traveling companion of the apostle
        Paul, was the first to bring Christianity to Alexandria (Eusebius II,
        16). However, it is not until the second century that we have any
        concrete evidence that there was a Christian community in that city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Although the Christian faction there remained relatively meager
        in size up until the fourth century, it was by no means insubstantial.
        Alexandria, being one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean world
        and one of diverse cultural and religious traditions, was a city
        renowned for its pursuit of ideas and philosophy, even before the
        Christians arrived. It is not surprising then, that the Christian
        congregation there also began to venture into these areas. A number of
        Alexandrian Christian leaders, among whom the most famous were Clement
        and Origen, made a name for themselves as students of philosophy. Their
        allegorical approach to understanding Scripture set them apart from the
        Christian teachers in Antioch, who advocated a more literal
        interpretation of the holy writings.<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: newspaper; text-kashida-space: 50%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 3; margin-right: 3; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:
EN">Up until the fourth century, several ideas about the nature of Christ and
        his relationship to his Father had been developing side-by-side. Yet
        controversy over these issues was infrequent, because few ever hastened
        to become specific in their references to the Father and Son. Phrases
        drawn from Scripture like Son of God, Lord, image of
        God, etc., were common expressions referring to Jesus and offended no
        one because of their generality. Even the term God (</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;
font-style:italic;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">theos</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">),
        when applied to Christ, remained ambiguous, because although some would
        take this to mean he was, in fact, the Almighty, others felt the term
        simply denoted a powerful spirit, a divine being.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>(Keep in mind, there is no indefinite article in Greek, nor rules
        of capitalization as in English, to make a distinction between God
        and god.) So for years this use of non-specific language allowed
        several understandings about the nature of Christ to develop and gain a
        foothold in the Church without the eruption of a major ecclesiastical
        controversy. Only extreme positions were attended to, and these radical
        groups, of course, lacked sufficient numbers of adherents to make any
        sort of a difference in the establishment of a consensus. The influence
        of Greek philosophy, however, stimulated an interest in theological
        exploration among the educated members of the mainstream church, and
        more and more of the Christian teachers, particularly in Alexandria,
        made motions toward specificity with regard to, amongst other things,
        the divine nature of Jesus Christ (</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;

        came a realization that there existed greater differences of opinion on
        the matter then was initially thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Disputes arose over which of these interpretations represented
        the understanding of the apostles. Before long, the entire Christian
        world was caught up in the debate (</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;font-style:italic;language:EN;

EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">At the center of the controversy were two former
        friends, Arius and Alexander. Alexander was the bishop, or city overseer
        of Alexandria. His position was highly regarded among the Alexandrian
        Christians, so much so that the name pope (meaning papa)
        began to be applied to him in an affectionate way even before the bishop
        of Rome received that honor (Williams 42). Arius was a presbyter (elder)
        presiding over the congregation of Baucalis within the city. According
        to Epiphanius, he was unusually tall, wore a short cloak and a dalmatic,
        and had a pleasant way of speaking (LXIX, 3:1). We do not know his
        precise age at the time of the quarrel, </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:
EN">but apparently he was already an old man (Epiphanius CLIV, 12). <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: newspaper; text-kashida-space: 50%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 3; margin-right: 3; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:
EN">The date traditionally applied to the outbreak of the dispute is 318. Older
        historians had taken note of a remark made by Athanasius in his</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;font-style:italic;language:EN;
mso-ansi-language:EN"> Letter to the Bishops of Egypt </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">(22),
        where he states that it has been 36 years since the Arians were
        pronounced heretics. Their chronology is based on the assumption that
        this letter was written in 356. Counting back 36 years would set the
        date for the declaration of the Arians as heretics at circa 321. The
        natural supposition was that in that year the council was held by
        Alexander whereby Arius was excommunicated. Logically, the controversy
        must have begun a few years before that council, because some in
        Alexandria had complained that Alexander took too long to handle the
        matter. This is the manner in which the date 318 is come by. However, we
        now know that Athanasius letter was written in 361, not 356.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Therefore, the pronouncement of Arius and his supporters as
        heretics can only refer to the council of Nicea, which took place in
        325, and this, of course, makes more sense, since Alexanders council
        in 321 was not thought of by many as official (Hanson 129-30).<o:p>

language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">Where does this leave us? Apparently,
        Athanasius letter does nothing to enlighten us as to the date for the
        beginning of the controversy. However, Jerome, in his </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;font-style:italic;language:EN;
mso-ansi-language:EN">Continuation of Eusebius Chronicle</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">
        may shed some light on the matter. In it he states that the whole affair
        began 2,337 years after Abraham, and by his reckoning this would give us
        a date of 320. Whether or not this is a reliable figure is arguable.
        However since it fits the chronological framework, we can provisionally
        use 320 as a starting point (Boularand 21-4).<o:p>

language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">Around this time it came to the attention of
        Alexander that Arius was publishing a doctrine with which many of the
        other presbyters were finding fault. At the same time, there were those
        in positions of authority that expressed agreement with his views (Epiphanius
        LXIX, 3:5). Alexander immediately sent for Arius and questioned him on
        the matter. Arius explained and defended his position (Epiphanius LXIX,
        3:5,6). The sensitivity of the issue and its complexity initially
        induced Alexander to let the matter lie. However, the force of the
        controversy only intensified. Alexander, therefore, saw the need of
        calling a meeting of the Alexandrian presbytery (Epiphanius LXIX, 3:6-7;
        Sozomen I, 15).<o:p>

        scholarship has reassessed this dating, however. The letter makes no
        mention of any excommunication or mistreatment by Alexander, and the
        list of signatories is made up of those known to be Arius earliest
        supporters. Chronologically it fits best into the early period and is
        probably an answer to Alexanders request for a statement of faith
        (Williams 52).<o:p>

EN">The signatures of Theonas and Secundus, the two bishops from Libya, at the
        end of the letter are interesting. As they were in positions of greater
        authority than Arius, they certainly add weight to his letter. Likewise,
        the Achillas mentioned may have been the Achillas who was the head of
        the famous catechetical school in Alexandria (Eusebius VII, 32:30;
        Williams 45; Barnes 202). He was no insignificant personality. It must
        have taken Arius a little time to rally support for his argument or
        insight into the problem, because in those days it could take weeks or
        months for information to pass back and forth between congregations, and
        the Libyan bishops were not exactly close by. Still, within the city
        itself, Arius and his friends had considerable backing. Theodoret
        describes them as going from house to house, apparently in the
        form of shepherding visits, trying to draw people over to their
        sentiments (I, 2). Whether this was the motive or not remains to be
        seen. Undoubtedly from Arius point of view, he was attempting to curb
        the influence of what he felt to be an apostate teaching gaining a
        strong foothold in Alexandria. According to one source, a well-known
        sisterhood of seventy unmarried Christian women sided with them (Epiphanius
        LXIX, 3:2).<o:p>

        opposite Arius right from the beginning, but it would </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:
EN">appear that this was not the case. Sozomens account puts Alexander in an
        intermediary position. If he requested credal statements from each of
        the contending parties, this would indicate that he was not at this time
        directly associated with either side. What is particularly interesting
        about the letter are the several instances where Arius claims that he is
        merely teaching the same doctrine as Alexander has in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Although these assertions are brief and stated rather generally,
        they should not be dismissed without due consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The following statement is noteworthy: God is before all as a
        single Unit and the Source of all things. And therefore he is also

        when you have preached in the congregation</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">. The concept that God is
        prior to Christ conflicts with the theology of Alexander as expounded in
        his later letters. Yet would Arius deliberately fabricate such a claim?
        This letter is addressed directly to Alexander, and Alexander knew well
        what doctrines he had published in the past. Why would Arius put words
        into Alexanders mouth if Alexander could easily and immediately
        dismiss those claims as false and thereby call into question Arius
        credibility? This would weaken Arius position considerably. One
        explanation is that Arius is simply misinterpreting a remark that
        Alexander once had made in one of his sermons. However, would it not be
        likely that one of the other thirteen men who signed the document would
        have seen the error and suggested a rewording? We cannot discount the
        possibility that Alexander had actually been teaching a doctrine of the
        sort described. His theological position may have been gradually
        evolving at this time, perhaps under the influence of others. Arius and
        Alexander had been associates for some years, even friends, and there is
        no evidence for any quarrels between the two prior to this time. Our
        first inclination would be to attribute a change in theological
        convictions to Arius, but we have no evidence whatsoever that Arius </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;
font-style:italic;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">ever</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:EN">
        possessed a different theological stance. With Alexander, the evidence,
        although marginal, is somewhat greater. Sozomen claims that Alexander
        was unsure of his position at one point (Sozomen I, 15). It is also well
        known that he was at this time developing a close friendship with the
        young deacon Athanasius, his personal secretary, whose strong belief in
        the equality and eternal generation of the Son made him a vehement
        opposer of Arius teachings early on. Therefore, we can at least
        suggest the possibility that it was Alexander who was in the process of
        altering his theological position, not Arius.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        occasion, as is generally the case in a strife of words, that each party
        claimed the victory . . . The council was convened a second time, and
        the same points contested, but they came to no agreement amongst
        themselves. During the debate, Alexander seemed to incline first to one
        party and then to the other; finally, however, he declared himself in
        favor of those who affirmed that the Son was of the same being as (</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

        and co-eternal with the Father, and he commanded Arius to receive this
        doctrine, and to reject his former opinions. Arius, however, would not
        be persuaded to compliance, and many of the bishops and clergy
        considered his statement of doctrine to be correct (I, 15).<o:p>

        some confusion on the part of the ancient church historians. All are in
        agreement that Arius and his supporters were all eventually
        excommunicated and banished from Alexandria. However, they also tell us
        that Arius remained in the city for some time, and apparently had some
        association with those </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;language:EN;mso-ansi-language:
EN">in the church. Epiphanius clearly says that Arius excommunication took
        place some time after the meetings (LXIX, 4:1). Comparing the various
        accounts, it would seem that Alexanders first course of action was
        not to excommunicate Arius, but to relieve him from his position of
        oversight over the congregation at Baucalis. As Theodoret relates, He
        ejected him from the order of the presbytery (I, 2). Yet it would
        seem that Arius still had the freedom of association within the
        congregation, though Alexander had him marked.<o:p>

        A massive letter writing campaign was initiated in an attempt to involve
        other bishops outside Egypt in the affair, initially those in Syria and
        Palestine. They sent a written statement of their doctrines to them,
        requesting them that, if they considered such sentiments to be of God,
        they would signify to Alexander that he ought not to harrass them; but
        that, if they disapproved of the doctrines, they would do well to
        declare what opinions were necessary to be held on the points in
        question (Sozomen I, 15). Surprisingly, they found more than just a
        little support.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quite a
        number of bishops were in agreement with the beliefs of Arius, most
        notably Eusebius Pamphilus, bishop of Caesarea. Letters began flooding
        in to Alexander, urging him to reconsider his position.<o:p>

        hostility toward Arius began to increase, and this finally culminated in
        a hearing which would result in the excommunication of Arius and his
        associates, as well as Arius' banishment from Alexandria.<o:p>

        way to Alexandria for his first imperial visit, having recently defeated
        his rival Licinius (in September 324) and taken control of the eastern
        sector of the Roman empire. He was very favorable towards the Christians
        and wished to make a special effort to bolster them up. He had no idea,
        of course, of the controversy raging there. However, after about
        three-fourths of his journey was completed, the matter was brought to
        his attention. We are not sure where he received the news or how, but I
        would venture to suggest that he learned of the matter in Caesarea,
        through Eusebius Pamphilus. There are several reasons for this: 1)
        Caesarea is approximately three-fourths of the journey from
        Constantinople to Alexandria; 2) It is through Eusebius that we have a
        copy of this letter, and all of the other letters in his Constantinian
        biography are his own personal copies; 3) in the letter Constantine
        wrote to Alexander and Arius (</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:100%;font-style:italic;

        II, 64-72), he takes a very Eusebian position regarding the issue.
        In other words, his main concern is for unity within the church, and the
        doctrinal issues are secondary. This might indicate that Constantine
        composed his letter in Caesarea in the presence of and under the
        influence of Eusebius.<o:p>

EN">Unfortunately, Constantines letter came too late. By the time it was
        hand-delivered in Alexandria, the excommunication of Arius and his
        associates had already occurred, and Arius was now on his way to
        Caesarea to seek communion with Eusebius (Epiphanius LXIX, 4:1). That,
        however, marks the beginning of the second stage of the controversy, and
        it is a story I shall leave for another time.<o:p>
