I did not operate any of those in the pictures.
I worked as a heavy equipment mechanic and shop foreman for about 36 years and worked on and operated a lot of that kind of equipment.
The pictures I get off hte internet.
It brings back a lot of memories.

Thanks for asking: DK

Boycott Big Oil, not just BP! Use less! Make your vehicle more fuel efficient! Use a more fuel efficient vehicle, walk, ride, use a bike, etc. Put more in your pocket! Save more, have more to invest, more to use as you wish, more to help others, etc. It's better for you and everyone!

Thanks for the comment. I think that the engine manufacturer's reluctance to accept alternative fuels is both short-sighted and unneccessarily obstinate. The first "diesel" engine demonstrated by Rudolf Diesel at the 1900 world's fair in Paris ran on straight peanut oil. But its a mistake to run straight vegetable oil in a modern diesel engine - they have been designed for the last 110 years to run exclusively off petroleum diesel. I don't think electric hybrid systems are necessary, though hydraulic hybrids on large vehicles make a lot of sense. Regardless, our vehicles in the future are necessarily going to have to be able to accept a wide variety of fuel sources (or possibly a common energy carrier such as electricity, except that the current electric car infrastructure is a complete boondoggle). Biodiesel in a hybrid diesel? Drop the ‘hybrid’ part and just run the diesel :)

I'll probably keep the truck but the trailer will go one of these years.We're considering a small motor home.

My 2009 Dodge diesel is in my "Trailer" album.

I would like to see some here in the Detroit metro. Every time I begin to apply the brakes for the yellow I look in the rear view to make sure someone is not going to rear-end me at 60 mph!

Hi Rooster! I spend quite a bit researching them. Gotta make sure they're relevant to the issue. Every time I see you I pump you up (and everybuddy else). LOL
