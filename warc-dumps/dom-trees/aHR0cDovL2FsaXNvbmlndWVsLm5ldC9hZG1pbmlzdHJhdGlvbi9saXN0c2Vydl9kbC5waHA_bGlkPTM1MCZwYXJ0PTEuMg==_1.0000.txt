<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">As part of an ongoing effort to make our school a model of
environmental leadership and sustainability, we are creating a school garden.
This garden will bring many benefits to our school, but above all, it will
serve as a reminder to students about the importance and worth of what we are
trying to protect: our environment. It is a project of the Green Now club, but
it is to involve many different groups on campus and benefit all students. The
garden will involve students in its growth and maintenance, fostering a greater
sense of personal responsibility as well as a sense of pride in their school
and community.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Going along with our environmental theme, we are filling the garden with native
plants. Native plants help conserve water, reduce mowing costs, provide habitat
for birds, butterflies and other wildlife, protect the soil and save money on
fertilizer and pesticides. Also, as Lady Bird Johnson said, native plants
"give us a sense of where we are in this great land of ours." Having
native plants therefore serves our two major motivations for this garden: to
teach sustainability and to enhance our sense of community. For most students,
however, the garden will simply be a pleasant, gentle reminder during hectic
schooldays of our connection with nature and the world around us.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The garden will be located next to the library windows in the large planter
area that is currently barren, leaving us room for future expansion should we
decide in the future to extend the garden. The set-up day is scheduled for <strong><b><font face="Times New Roman">Sunday, March 28 from 9 AM to 12 PM</font></b></strong>.
<st1:place w:st="on">Mission</st1:place> Landscaping Services and our PTSA are
generously providing the materials for the garden, but we will need some
volunteers to bring the following items:<br>
3 brooms<br>
10 shovels<br>
3 hammers<br>
If you can bring any of these items or are otherwise interested in helping out
on the 27th, please contact Neil Aronson at <a href="mailto:neilaronson@gmail.com">neilaronson@gmail.com</a> or 949-310-0031.
We will only need about 10-15 parent volunteers in addition to student
volunteers, so we're especially looking for anyone with experience in gardening
or construction. Please let us know as soon as possible if you can help so that
we can coordinate getting all of the materials together.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We would just like to give a special thanks to Mission Landscaping Services,
our school PTSA and Mr. Kirk Elliott who have all been essential in helping to
realizing this garden.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
