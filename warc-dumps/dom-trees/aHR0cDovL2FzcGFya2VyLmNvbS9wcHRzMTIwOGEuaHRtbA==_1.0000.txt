    <h2> 10 Questions For Year End Planning</h2>
    <p>Writing a business plan for your practice is very important for the success 
      of your practice. I've written an article on the thinking and preparation 
      you need in order to write the plan. <a href="http://www.abanet.org/genpractice/magazine/2008/oct-nov/key_bus_plan.html" target="_blank">You 
      will find it here.</a> Answer these 10 questions and you will be ready to 
      put pen to paper. </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What is your vision of your practice when it is exactly as you 
        want it to be?</strong> Whether your practice is relatively new or you 
        have been practicing for many years it is important to revisit your vision 
        frequently. Desiring to reach that vision provides you with the energy 
        to stick with the practice when the going gets rough, to pursue a stretch 
        goal persistently, and to market your practice with enthusiasm. </li>
      <li><strong>What are your business goals for 2009?</strong> You may have 
        a big vision for your practice that you cannot achieve in one year. What 
        4 or 5 big goals do you have for this year that will keep you moving in 
        a straight line toward your vision? Make them specific, attainable, measureable, 
        realistic and time bound. </li>
      <li><strong>Will this vision of your practice and the goals you have set 
        support the vision you have of your life? </strong>What is most important 
        is that you are building the kind of life you really want. This means 
        you have a solid practice and a happy personal life. It isn't healthy 
        or wise to set your goals so aggressively that you have no time for yourself 
        or your family and friends. It is imperative to set reasonable goals: 
        ones that will not be so large that it will mean working day and night 
        nor so small you are unable to meet your lifestyle goals and vision. This 
        may be difficult to balance but it is very important. </li>
      <li><strong>When will you take your vacation(s) in 2009?</strong> Plan your 
        vacations now so that all your financial calculations are made allowing 
        for you to be absent from the office during vacation time. It is more 
        likely that you will take your vacation(s) if you put them on your calendar 
        right now and account for them in your planning. </li>
      <li><strong>What will you do on a regular basis for self care to keep you 
        and your firm in optimal condition?</strong> Planning for the financial 
        success of your practice is important but if the practice depends solely 
        on your work or if you have to bill a certain number of hours in a year 
        you must keep yourself physically and emotionally fit to give your practice 
        your all when you are working. Be sure to include time for activities 
        and habits that keep you fit for your practice. </li>
      <li><strong>What skills will you develop this year? </strong>Being proficient 
        in one or two skills helps to differentiate you from your competition. 
        Taking classes, reading and/or going to conferences that focus on that 
        skill or the use of that skill will help you to gain proficiency. Becoming 
        a thought leader in a particular area will make you standout from others. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>Have you seen your accountant for year end tax planning? </strong>Sometimes 
        it is advisable to make purchases that you plan for next year at the end 
        of the current year. Other times more money must be set aside for taxes 
        than you had planned. Checking with the accountant now will allow you 
        to do better financial planning for 2009. </li>
      <li><strong>What measurements did you follow in 2008? Did they give you 
        an accurate picture of the health of your practice?</strong> Make adjustments 
        in the measurements you follow to insure that you will know immediately 
        when business is slowing, when revenue is not coming in on time, or when 
        clients are dissatisfied. Goals for 2009 should have measurements attached 
        so you know if you are making progress. </li>
      <li><strong>What is your budget for 2009?</strong> Based on the information 
        you got from your accountant, your measurements during 2008 and your 2009 
        goals and forecast, you are now able to develop a realistic budget for 
        your practice for 2009. </li>
      <li><strong>Who will offer support to you and your practice during the year?</strong> 
        No one can run a practice all alone. Your practice and you need support 
        to insure that you make good plans, you execute the plans well, the practice 
        is profitable, that you carry the right financial decisions, and that 
        you stay physically and emotionally fit. You'll need someone to bounce 
        ideas off so that you make good well thought out decisions. Some possibilities 
        for support are: your accountant, your insurance vendor, your trainer, 
        your doctor, your practice advisor, other attorneys, your financial advisor 
        etc. Some find it helpful to set up a board of advisors to help them with 
        their practice. <br>
