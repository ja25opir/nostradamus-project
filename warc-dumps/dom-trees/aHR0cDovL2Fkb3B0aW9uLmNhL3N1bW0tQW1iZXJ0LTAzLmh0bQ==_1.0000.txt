          <h5>CANADIAN ADOPTION RESEARCH 
            SUMMARIES</h5>
          <hr>
          <h5>Ambert, Anne-Marie. (April 
            2003) The Negative Social Construction of Adoption: Its Effects on 
            Children and Parents </h5>
          <p>This 
            article explores the social construction of adoption. Ambert examines 
            reasons why childless individuals prefer biological alternatives to 
            adoption, the prevalence of adoption, characteristics of birth parents 
            and adoptive parents, the social construction of adoptive parents 
            and the adjustment of adopted and nonadopted children. Ambert discusses 
            the validity of research on adopted children and addresses issues 
            surrounding transracial, international and step child adoption. The 
            author also addresses open adoption and reunions with birth parents. 
            </p>
          <p>In regards 
            to international adoption, Ambert states that Canadians have recently 
            adopted between 2,000 and 2,500 children internationally on an annual 
            basis. She reports that in 2002, Americans adopted 20,000 children 
            internationally with 64% adopting girls and 36% adopting boys (Ambert, 
            20-21). The author states that this sex ratio imbalance is due in 
            part from the fact that many children originate from China where most 
            of the available children are females because of the one-child family 
            policy and preference for male children. </p>
          <p>The author 
            discusses how between 1971 and 2001, Americans adopted over 265,000 
            children internationally. She states that the countries parents are 
            adopting from have changed with time. After World War II, most adopted 
            children were from Europe and Korea. In 2001, 25% of American children 
            adopted internationally came from China and 22% came from Russia (Ambert, 
            21).</p>
          <p>Ambert 
            notes that approximately 90% of the adopted children are under the 
            age of 5, therefore North Americans who wish to adopt young children 
            often find adopting internationally more likely to result in adopting 
            a young child than would be the case within their country. The author 
            also discusses how adopting internationally is attractive to North 
            Americans not only because of a shortage of infants in North America, 
            but also because of the certainty that birth parents will not return 
            to claim their children. Ambert suggests that these adoptions carry 
            a greater sense of finality. Ambert notes that, although biomedical 
            knowledge about the birth families is scarce in international adoptions 
            adoptive parents are also aware that they will not have to contend 
            with reunions with birth parents in the future.</p>
