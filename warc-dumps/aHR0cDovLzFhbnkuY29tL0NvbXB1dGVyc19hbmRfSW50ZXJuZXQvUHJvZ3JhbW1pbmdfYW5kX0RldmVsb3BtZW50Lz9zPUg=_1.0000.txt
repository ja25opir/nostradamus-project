Recently we had the opportunity to sit down and discuss linking strategies with the experts over at all-seo.com

The session provided some great tactics to help site owners increase their presence on the internet. The nice folks over at alta-publishing.com provided a transcript of the discussion and the following text includes excerpts from the conversation.

" I think in the affiliate arean it is more like a 95%, 5% role, you know it is 5% of the affiliates developing 95% of the revenue due to their aggressive tactics and you know I would think as a manufacturer you want to really study that and take those tactics and then feed them back to 95% to help make some of them more successful.

Are we just wondering now, while we were talking about this, have you considered an approach or some sort of program for business owners where you could put together a linking strategy, let us say almost a guidebook or a methodology to deal with their super affiliates could use or is there any way for you to help a business in that sense?

Have thought about some sort of program but again for every site or every circumstance to build something that looks natural it can’t be a cookie cutter type program and it may work better for say an affiliate program that is starting from scratch as opposed to a group that has lot of sites that are all over the place. But yes obviously let us think about and as I look at the different clients that I work with, I pick pieces of information and put it in my blog or put it in my notes to think about that in the future but so often it is just a different circumstance.
