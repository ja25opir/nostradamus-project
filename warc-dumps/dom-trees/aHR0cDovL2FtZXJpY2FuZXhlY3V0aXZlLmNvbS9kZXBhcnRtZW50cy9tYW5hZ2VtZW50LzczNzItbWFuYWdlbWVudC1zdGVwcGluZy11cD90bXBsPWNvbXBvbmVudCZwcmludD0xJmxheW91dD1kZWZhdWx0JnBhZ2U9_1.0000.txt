<p><img class="caption" src="/images/stories/0310_IND_Management.jpg" border="0" alt="Management: Stepping Up" align="right"> When financial markets tumbled in the fourth quarter of 2008, <a href="http://www.studio-g-architects.com/" target="_blank">Studio G Architects</a> in Boston felt the effects almost immediately. One client after another called to freeze their projects. Firm principal Gail Sullivan suddenly had to decide whether or not to lay off workers who no longer had enough work.<br><br>After cutting back hours for all 10 staff members, Sullivan decided to deploy another strategy: offer the firm’s services pro bono to select pro bono.<br><br>Studio G anticipates rising demand in the coming decade for playgrounds that use natural environments instead of plastic-coated jungle gyms. Until recently, the firm didn’t have any such playgrounds in its portfolio. Today, it has two to show off because the firm agreed in the dark days of 2008 to make preliminary designs for local nonprofits at no cost.<br><br>“We didn’t have anything like this in our portfolio because we hadn’t been able to convince anyone to do it,” Sullivan said. “This gives us something we can point to for the next client and say, ‘This is what we’re talking about.’” <br><br>The so-called Great Recession has accelerated a trend of freeing up employees to volunteer on company time. Cisco, Intel, and Wells Fargo have been running such programs for years. Now the practice has become even more commonplace as small businesses, law firms, and others aim to retain talent and woo customers on what may be the cusp of an economic recovery.<br><br>However, as corporate volunteer programs grow increasingly common, consultants say it’s critical for organizations to clarify what they’re trying to accomplish. That means assessing not only how pro bono initiatives benefit recipients and communities, but how they benefit the bottom line.<br><br>“Just volunteering doesn’t get you very far,” said Jason Saul, CEO of Mission Management, a Chicago-based consultancy that helps companies measure returns on their volunteerism investments. “Companies need to get more strategic and more thoughtful about the purpose of volunteering to get any value out of it.” <br><br><strong>A wide variety</strong><br>Corporate volunteerism takes myriad forms. It can be as specialized as IBM’s service corps, which sends technicians to develop information infrastructure in the developing world, or as ordinary as “done in a day” programs run by mortgage insurer PMI. These free up workers three or four times a year for a few hours. Their projects are sometimes as simple as bagging goods at a food pantry near PMI’s corporate headquarters in Walnut Creek, Calif. <br><br>Payoffs for organizations with volunteer programs can vary widely as well. Starbucks Coffee Company, for instance, cultivates leadership skills by having employees organize community service events. Proponents of volunteer programs say they can enhance community relations and boost employee morale.<br> <br>But sending employees to volunteer does little good if the practice masks an unspoken problem, such as a worker’s failure to justify his or her salary in tough times, according to Samuel Culbert, a leadership expert at the University of California Los Angeles’ Anderson School of Management.<br><br>“You can call this corporate responsibility in giving, but what you’re looking for is day care for people you don’t have any work for,” Culbert said. “Call it what it is. Workers are just going along with it for self-interested reasons.” <br><br>Instead of creating charitable tasks for workers with time to spare, Culbert said, managers should explore with these workers how they might bring in new business or otherwise add value to the enterprise. <br><br><strong>Engaging prospects</strong><br>Eager to quantify returns on investment, companies are exploring how they can measure the impact of their volunteer programs. In January 2010, Starbucks convened a Community Service Summit in Seattle where leaders from for-profit, nonprofit, and academic arenas gathered to brainstorm how to measure the impacts of volunteerism. <br><br>At this point, Starbucks assumes that its volunteer programs have a positive impact on employee morale, according to Rodney Hines, director of community investments. He added that customers appreciate when Starbucks employees volunteer in visible ways in their cities and towns. By enlisting employees and customers alike, the coffee giant aspires to marshal one million hours of community service per year by 2015. <br><br>But for companies to do meaningful volunteer work in a long-term, sustainable fashion, Saul said, they need to do a better job of tracking how their programs create value for their organizations.<br><br>“When I spoke with one CEO of a Fortune 1000 company, he said: ‘Telling me that my employees volunteered 100,000 hours just makes me wonder why they’re not working.’ Business doesn’t care about employee volunteer hours—but it understands the percentage of employees that are highly engaged.” He said employees who volunteer on company time tend to have longer careers with their companies, employ discretionary effort on the job, and be good brand ambassadors.<br><br>Some companies are tailoring employee volunteer programs to deliver internal payoffs in areas that need strengthening. OfficeMax, for instance, has at times freed up workers for a day to distribute free supplies to school teachers. This represents a good deed, Saul said, while building personal relationships between employees and a key customer demographic. Perhaps paid days off for a particular type of volunteering will convert into increased sales to teachers in the future.<br><br>To get organizational value from a volunteer program, companies must make sure that key constituencies know about their efforts. McDonald’s, for instance, has aimed to reduce high turnover rates by getting employees more engaged in the work of the Ronald McDonald House, which provides lodging for families of children undergoing specialized medical treatment. <br><br>Employees get opportunities to volunteer at these facilities, and the company gives them badges to wear on their uniforms, touting McDonald’s involvement with this charity. Such initiatives help employees feel engaged with a larger cause, Saul said, and might help reduce turnover.<br><br>Companies committed to doing good deeds sometimes fail to receive recognition. That has in the past been the case for Studio G, Sullivan said, because the company for years didn’t make a point to highlight the pro bono work that employees did for charitable organizations. <br><br>As managers perfect the art of using volunteerism for business advantage, they are perhaps ensuring that good deeds done on company time will be more than a fad.<br><br>“I want companies to do more volunteering,” Saul said. “The only way to get them to do that is to demonstrate the business value of doing it. And the way they’re going to get more business value is to do high-value, skills-based volunteering that makes sense for their organizations.” <br> <br><em>G.
