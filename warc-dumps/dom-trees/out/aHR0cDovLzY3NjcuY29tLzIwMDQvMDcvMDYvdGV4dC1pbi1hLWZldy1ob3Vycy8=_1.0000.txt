<p> I’ve been looking for your book: Don’t Try This at Home for ages now and it seems nowhere in the UK stocks it. Do you know of any US sites that I could get it from?<br>
It’s actually not out yet. Try Amazon or something like that around October or November.<br>
2. What kind of performances do you prefer large or small scale?<br>
I like both for different reasons, but we are going to stick to small intimate gigs for quite a while.<br>
3. Do you know wes borland? If so what is your take on him and his music?<br>
I don’t know him but I appreciate his work. His solo stuff is very trippy.<br>
4. When you and Carmen have kids and they´re in their early teens and ready to embark on their own chemically enhanced journeys, how do you plan to approach the subject of drug use/abuse?<br>
I hope to be able to shed some light on the subject and I will certainly be forthcoming with my experiences, but I also know that kids will be kids and I’ll have to be willing to deal with whatever comes along with that.<br>
5. I was wondering, do you have faith in a higher force, and if so, which?<br>
I do. It is a God of my own personal understanding, which is nice because my views are always open to change and expansion.<br>
6. So Dave………….this “Circle of the Nooose” song????????????????????????????<br>
I love that song. I hope that the Peppers someday put it out or at least make it available on the Internet for downloads. I don’t have a copy or I would stick it up myself.<br>
7. Anyway, He’s (Billy Duffy) spoken very highly of you in the past and was wondering what your take on him and The Cult were?<br>
Duffy is amazing. He is consistently on point with his playing. I’ve never heard him hit a sour note. The Cult really influenced me when the Love album came out. It is always an honor to jam with him.<br>
8. Hi Dave, I just saw an old rerun of ‘Cribs’ with you on it. Cool house, I was just wondering if that’s where you still live ’cause it looked different than your house on ‘Til Death Do Us Part’.<br>
Thank you. We have since moved.<br>
9. One stupid question: You said you play CDs from your own collections, so who the Soundgarden “LTL” belongs to?<br>
That, was mine!<br>
10. Dave, have you ever seen the Embrace comic books that Carmen was involved with?<br>
I know about it but I haven’t seen it. She doesn’t have a copy. <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley"><br>
Peace,<br>
Dave</p>

<p>hey dave – thanks for the candor on the site…as a fan of your music for well over 15 years…its great to pseudo-meet you…i’m thinking invite only gig for the people on the site heh<br>
i was in a borders yesterday and they had a book of sheet music from the JA days (like it was that long ago)…it said ‘reproduced with permission’ – do you guys actually approve it? or just tell them ’sure go ahead’ Like are they accurate if they have the ‘with permission’ label?<br>
looking forward to hearing the new sounds…<br>

<p>Hey Dave,<br>
Thanks for letting us know that it is cool to say hello to you if we ever see you in public. My wife and I sat right next to you at Sushi-Roku a couple of years ago, but we didn’t want to bother you. You were even sitting there all by yourself waiting for Andy Slater. Not long ago we saw you and Carmen shopping at the Grove too. Even though we would have loved to talk to you, I always figured that you guys get sick of being bothered when you are trying to live your lives.<br>
Since you said that there are no stupid questions, here is my question. Do you think that there would ever be the opportunity for someone who has worked in the music industry before to work for either you or one of your bands? I am looking for a job right now, and I figured that I would never know if I didn’t ask. Let me know what you think.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Eric</p>

<p>Excalibur<br>

I froze your tears and made a dagger<br>
And stabbed it in my cock forever<br>
It stays there like Excalibur<br>
Are you my Arthur?<br>
Say you are<br>
Take this cool, dark, steel-ed blade<br>
Steal it<br>
Sheath it in your lake<br>

<p>Hey Dave,  reading the posts about your episode of Cribs reminded me of the Janes Addiction Soul Kiss video.  I was always wondering a couple of things.  Was that a real eel you slammed against the table?  Also, is/was Stephen really disgusted by fruits?</p>

<p>Hi Dave,<br>
Hope you had a great 4th of July.<br>
I played guitars with my boyfriend on the beach in Santa Cruz, CA<br>
We’re writing some really cool open tuning songs.<br>
The fireworks that people set off there are insane, total anarchy, total freedom…<br>
I feared for my life twice. Nothing like it. I bet you’d love it.<br>
My question is have you ever jammed with a girlfriend? Or does Carmen play any instruments?<br>
Saraswati</p>

From Manson’s stories about you, you seem like a really fun human.  I am wondering if you like toys and which one might be your favorite?  Would you have any interest in designing a toy of your own?  and lastly what do you when you want to have fun?<br>

Dave, oh firstly, thanks alot for the great music and inspirational guitar playing. I was just wondering, with this new band, are you going to be experimenting with any new ideas (e.g. new styles) than previously? Also, are you trying out any new equipment (i.e. new guitar, effects pedals)?<br>
Thanks.<br>

<p>Great to hear you have a copy of Soundgarden LTL. One of my favourite bands ever – along with Jane’s obviously <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"><br>
Were you a fan of Soundgarden? I’d love to know what you think of their music.<br>
And – since you already said you’re a fan of Tom Morello and Zac de la Rocha I’d be interested to know what you think of Audioslave…<br>
Had any discussions with Audioslave about how to overcome the “same band new singer” misconceptions?? <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"><br>

<p>Hi Dave,<br>
1.	Have you heard of The Sleepy Jackson, if so what do you think of them???<br>
2.	Is your MTV show available on DVD?   I loved that show but I missed the last 2 episodes because I’m a jackass and didn’t pay my cable bill.  Anyhow I just wanted to finish watching it.<br>
3.	I just wanted to thank you again for your time; I really enjoy reading your post as well as everyone’s reaction to them.      It kind of gives us an insight into the man behind the artist and for what it’s worth you seem like an exceptional man with no hang-ups.<br>
Thanks again,<br>
Wendy</p>

<p>Hey Dave, I have seen janes play 3 times and loved everyone of them. The last show I saw was at the Hollywood Bowl and Courtney Love opened for you guys. She refused to get off the stage and for that your show was cut short due to time constraints. Were you as pissed off as i was when she wouldnt leave the stage? I hate her now. I didnt go to see her i went to see the greatest band ever! Janes Addiction.</p>

<p>Dave I just wanted to tell you as an 18 year old guitar player, YOU are my Jimmy Page. “Trust No One” is one of my favorite Cds and you are a true inspiration to me. I LOVED Janes but you can’t force something to work if it’s not going to happen so I totally understand what all you guys decided to do. One question-If it’s true about how Axl Rose asked you a while ago to join the new GNR and you declined citing your CD as the reason, has he contacted you after that and after Buckethead left? Did Slash ever talk to you about that? Sorry if I’m being too inquiring.<br>

<p>Hey Dave,<br>
Kind of a personal question here. I remember you were supposed to play a show here in St. Louis on 9/11 at the Galaxy. It was a $1.05 show and I would have gone regardless the price. I remember waking up and seeing what all had went on and figured fuck that show is cancelled and it was. My question is where were you as this was going on? In the air to STL, in STL or what? Just happened to think about that randomly<br>

<p>‘Kids will be kids’ is a good philosophy, I always tried to get my parents to latch onto it – they didn’t buy it, early curfews continued on. <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"><br>
I hope they play Til Death Do Us Part again too, MTV seems to show reruns of everything else constantly – I swear I’ve  seen every episode of The Real World: San Diego at least twice. The reunion episode was on tonight – I actually felt kind of nostalgic watching it, seeing as how I’ve seen all the episodes so many times.;-)<br>
Anyway, a friend got me thinking about this today, but what are you feelings on the paparazzi? My friend was saying he heard some celebrity saying that they didn’t mind them because they were just doing their job, but that a lot of people disagreed with him. Do they bother you and Carmen a lot? I’d probably be initally okay wth the attention and then retreat intensely after a few weeks of it.:-)</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to this new project.  It seems like you guys are ready to move past Jane’s, and I support that. Thank you, and now, some questions…<br>
1. Jane’s has released a bunch of live material, (xxx, kettle whistle, three days, and the strays dvd), however, besides the xxx cd, nothing has been a release strictly dedicated to live recordings.  Is there unreleased live footage for a possible dvd or something in the future?  Would you even want to release more live material?  I’m sure fans wouldn’t mind, but I’m curious what you think at this point.<br>
2. On a different note…  When did you start wearing make-up and feminine clothes on a day to day basis off stage as well as on?  Why did you start when you did?  Was it just because it looked good, (certainly very important)?<br>
Are you responsible for this whole metrosexual movement?  Are you using your good looks and ability to attract both men and women to take over the world?  Be honest…<br>
Thanks again for your time, and best wishes – ZOE OTIS</p>

<p>Hey Dave<br>
Info on your main white PRS would be cool. I read somewhere you use PRS pickups- HFS n Vintage Bass? Am I right. And yes, your own PRS guitar would kick ass…but only in SE, noway I can afford the full PRS prices!<br>
Couple more questions for ya, did you play with Dave Kushner on your solo tour? and any chance your Rhimorse album is available anywhere. Like so many others it seems, TNO has become such an inspiration and I would love to hear earlier material. Any chance of coming to England soon?<br>
Finally, a friend of mine told me he knew someone that went up to John Frusciantes house out of the blue n John let him in and they played for a bit…any chance you could leave your address on here for us guitarists!!!!<br>
Take care and all the best for you n Carmen (I read her real name was Tara Patrick? Which do you call her???)</p>

<p>Hi there Dave.  Now that it’s summer here in LA do you find yourself getting to the beach much??? You deserve to kick back and relax? Both you AND Tara Navarro should go to Malibu and have some dinner at Tony’s Taverna. De-lish.<br>
What is your morning routine like?  Do you make your bed?  Do you drink coffee?<br>
Tell me about your pets.<br>
Take care now and be a good boy. LYLAS!</p>

<p>dear david, this question is not really music related or anything but you seem like a wise and wordly man, I am a fan of your work, and respect your opinions, so maybe you can help me, i know this man named david who i am dating, and he has lumpy cum, i am not sure if you are familiar with it but it is equivalent to the consistency of cottage cheese, im sure you have heard of a lot of vanerial diseases, should I be worried?  should I stop swollowing, I am too embarassed to ask friends and scared to ask the doctor.<br>
on a more musical note i have a personal question for you<br>
do you think yo will shave your beard or your head ever, i read there is a scientific study that says if you shave all of your hair of your body and slather yourself with baby oil the vibrations of music can sound more powerful, would you ever consider trying out this theory?  I bet you would still look beauutiful!</p>

<p>Hi Dave, its good to hear that it will be intimate gigs for a while.  The UK gigs in November last year were made really special for being at the front….<br>
I have recently downloaded the Hungry screensaver (which is really cool) but I am wondering what the significance is with a poodle and a turtle (if any)?   <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

<p>Hi<br>
Thanks for the answer;)<br>
Were you ever a fan of Soundgarden? What do you think about their music?<br>
Do you still believe in the Love/Christmas Theory?<br>
You and Carmen seem to be the living proof that such a thing as true love really exists, so…:)<br>
Thanks for your time,<br>
Veronica</p>
