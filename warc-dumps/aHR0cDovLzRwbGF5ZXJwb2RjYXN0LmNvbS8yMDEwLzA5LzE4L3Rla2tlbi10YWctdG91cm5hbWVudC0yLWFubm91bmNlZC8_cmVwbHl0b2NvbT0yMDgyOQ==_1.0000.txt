TGS 2010: Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Announced

in General (http://4playerpodcast.com/category/general/)

 (http://4playerpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jstekkentag2teaser06.jpg) In case you were unaware, Tekken Tag Tournament is my favorite fighting game ever, and one of my favorite games of all time. It is the fighting game that got me into competitive Tekken, and even though it was released in 1999, it still holds up to modern standards. TTT was the follow-up to three main Tekken releases, so it’s unsurprising that they announce TTT2 after Tekken 6. I am somewhat surprised considering the team is working on Tekken x Street Fighter, but TTT2 is actually coming before that releases (to arcades at least).

Here’s the trailer:

I do have my concerns. I worry about the freshness of the series at this point. The first TTT was a follow-up to Tekken 3, a Tekken game that booted a lot of the previous games’ rosters and had a large new cast of characters. So when TTT was announced, not only did we see the return of all the missing fighters in the series before Tekken 3, but they had entirely new modern move-sets. So in reality, the game featured well over a dozen “new” fighters.

The problem with Tekken 4, 5, and 6 is that no characters were booted from one game to the next. Every character that was in 4 was also in 5. Every character that was in 5 was also in 6. So when Tekken Tag Tournament 2 comes out, the nostalgia of seeing old characters return is non-existent. The only remedy to this problem is for the team to create a large roster of new characters, and maybe bring back the few fighters that never made it out of the first TTT (Kunimitsu, Ogre, Michelle, Jun, P Jack, etc). Well, I guess we might see Combot again too (bleh).

My other concern is with the Tag mechanic itself. How the hell does tagging work when near a wall? And what is with the Tag spam mid juggle? It reminds me more of the shitty Dead or Alive Tag Mode. The Tag mechanic in the first TTT was very well designed and balanced. It was to be used with precision and strategy, and was hardly just some button used to freely switch out your character. I’ll be crushed if they drop the ball on this one.

I’m also a bit worried about the brand itself. The first TTT followed the release of Tekken 3, which was not only the best selling in the series, but is often considered one of the best fighting games ever. Tekken 6 was not received nearly as well, and I’m certain this game will be ignored by everyone but the competitive scene. Will this game even make it to consoles?

The series needs a visual overhaul if they plan to turn heads in the future — new models, outfits, hair styles, animations, etc. The team needs to do what they did with Tekken 4, but not fuck up the gameplay.

Holy shiiiiii- I did not expect to see this at all! Although I do share some of the same concerns, I’m still pretty damn excited this is getting a sequel in the first place.

This is kind of good news, I remember you talking about TTT. I will be anticipating this because although I enjoy playing fighting games, they can bore me pretty quickly. So it is nice to see a game like this coming, where there is a little more to it.

But they are working on two different Tekken games, which kind of intrigues me. It is a little weird having Tekken 6 not doing as well as expected and now having two games coming in succession at the same time.

I don’t care for this. It’s obvious that they are milking the series way too hard now. I’m much more interested in the new Mortal Kombat instead of the dial a combo air juggling style of Tekken.

Pick a name and stick with it or I’ll give you one. So choose, either a name for your IP or a ban for your IP.

I have chosen my name. Also, have fun with your Tekken 6 with the “Tag” feature slapped on it.

Shit talking troll seems more appropriate. You clearly have no clue or patience with Tekken, which is fine but I hate morons who try and sum up a fighting game(imo the most intricite of all genres) in a dumbass sentance like “dail a combo”. That is just pathetic.

I’m a huge Tekken fan,but I’m not sure where I stand on this. “Tekken 6″ is still fresh in my mind,plus SFxTekken/TekkenxSF are in the pipeline (and they’re still working on “Tekken 7″ right?). Just seems a little unnecessary….this soon anyway.

I’ve heard most people dislike Tekken 6 due to the addition of the Bound System, which I don’t think is all that overpowered it just makes being punished hurt a lot more than before.
On a side note I was thinking of picking up Lili as a secondary to my Julia as main, but after seeing that trailer if the game comes over to the states I’ll definitely have to pick up Asuka as well just to make them partners… lol

Tekken Tag is easily my most played and adored fighting game. I had only played a bit of Tekken 3 at the arcades before Tag, so when I did play Tag it was like brand new game with exciting fighting styles and groovy 3d gameplay. In regards to TTT2, I just don’t want it. Nothing excites me like the original did. The tag juggling I saw in the trailer just makes me think of KOs being accomplished in one combo even if you might no be that experienced. I think Namco needs to take a little break after Tekken X Street Fighter and let that series marinate in the minds of the consumer before whipping up a new batch.

I would love to give this a go.
To be honest I haven’t played many fighting games since tekken 4. I guess i haven’t missed much. I’ve never been able to play a fighting game without getting bored in a few hours :l.
I’ll give it a go
they better give me gon and tekken ball again

When I saw this announcement I almost had a heart attack. Tag is my favorite Tekken EVAR!!!!! I can’t believe they are making a second one, I am so excited. I absolutely love the series and Tag is still my favorite even with all the new games since then. I really liked some of the aspects of 6, so for them to be bringing out Tag right afterwards, I can only imagine that they are going to be doing a Tag version of 6, so to speak, which has me excited. It will be interesting to see what they improve and how they implement the various aspects of the most recent games into Tag2.

God I miss Tekken ball :D
