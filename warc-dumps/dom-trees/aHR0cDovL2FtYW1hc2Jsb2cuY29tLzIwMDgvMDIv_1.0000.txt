     <div class="date">February 28, 2008</div>	<div class="story">						
     <p><span style="color: #333399;">I watched </span><a href="http://www.thebusinessofbeingborn.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a62699;"><em>The Business of Being Born</em>&nbsp; </span></a><span style="color: #333399;">(TBOBB) last night (available now through Netflix).&nbsp; This is a documentary produced by former talk show host, Ricki Lake, on the state of birthing in America.&nbsp; As I posted the other night, in short the summary of the film is this: (from The Business of Being Born’s Website) </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Birth: it’s a miracle. A rite of passage. A natural part of life. But more than anything, birth is a business. Compelled to find answers after a disappointing birth experience with her first child, actress Ricki Lake recruits filmmaker Abby Epstein to examine and question the way American women have babies. </em></span></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333399;">The film interlaces intimate birth stories with surprising historical, political and scientific insights and shocking statistics about the current maternity care system. When director Epstein discovers she is pregnant during the making of the film, the journey becomes even more personal. </span></em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333399;">Should most births be viewed as a natural life process, or should every delivery be treated as a potentially catastrophic medical emergency?</span></em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">As I settled in to watch, I was expecting a “good” documentary on a subject that interests me.&nbsp; To be perfectly honest, I don’t watch very many documentaries, and had kind of figured this would be like <em>The Baby Story</em>, but in reverse.&nbsp; Instead of seeing high drama-hospital medical births with drugs and C-sections, I would see midwives and natural home births.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">In no way was I prepared for my reaction.&nbsp; Shortly into the 1 hour and 24 minute documentary, I was in tears, sobbing.&nbsp; It was like a floodgate had been opened, and every vented up emotion that I had about my own experiences giving birth, was released.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I was in awe of the beautiful, natural, and peaceful births shown at home, with skilled and highly trained midwives.&nbsp; During labor, the mothers&nbsp;were roaming around their homes, freely and unobstructed.&nbsp; There was a woman who had a water birth, with her young son watching, totally calm and relaxed.&nbsp; There were images of newly born home birthed babies lying peacefully and contentedly on their mother’s chests just seconds after being born, gazing lovingly up in their mother’s eyes. The mother’s, though tired from just giving birth were alert, happy, and peaceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Those images were contrasted with the “typical” hospital birth.&nbsp; Women in bed, hooked up to monitors, oxygen masks, and IV’s, with drug cocktails dripping into their systems.&nbsp; Babies left screaming and crying in the incubators by themselves, or not “allowed” to be with their mothers immediately after birth. One scene showed an exhausted mother, being prepped and wheeled off on a gurney to the operating room for a C-section.&nbsp; It was not hurried, so I don’t believe it was an emergency C-section, rather more likely than not, she was not able to birth her baby in the allotted time that so many hospitals have.&nbsp; She had her eyes closed, totally detached from the experience, and it struck me like she was a lamb going off to the proverbial slaughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">It was so striking seeing that, compared to the homebirths.&nbsp; The women at home were in control and had complete and entire power over the birth of their babies. They were the ones who decided when it was time to birth their baby, and they had total confidence in their bodies.&nbsp; They didn’t need IV’s, drugs dripping in their systems, weakening the labor process, constant monitoring, doctors and nurses telling them when to push, and micromanaging their labors, and they didn’t need C-sections.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">As I sat there watching this, I kept thinking of the women shown having their babies at home, and <strong>THAT</strong> is what birth is supposed to be like.&nbsp; That is how women have given birth for thousands and thousands of years, until the last fifty years or so in America.&nbsp; Women should be the ones to dictate how the birthing of their child, their flesh and blood goes, not doctors, nurses, and hospitals who have to practice defensive medicine to avoid lawsuits, and to meet insurance companies criteria.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">It was a powerful moment for me, and I realized how angry I have been about Ryan’s birth.&nbsp; I have written about <a href="http://amamasblog.wordpress.com/2008/01/31/the-reality-of-c-sections/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #b043bc;">my C-section </span></a>before, but in summary, the only reason I had to have a C-section with Ryan was because he was breech.&nbsp; No other complications or problems.&nbsp; A C-section was my only “option.”&nbsp; Doctors don’t “do” breech vaginal deliveries anymore and certainly not where I lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, I didn’t consider home birth an option, and in my state it is illegal for midwives to knowingly deliver a breech baby anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I trusted that my doctor was doing her best for me, but in reality she was only doing what she “had” to do. Advise me a C-section was the “safest” way to deliver a breech baby.&nbsp; She was in a large HMO practice, and even though she told me about doulas and exercises I could do to try to turn the baby, she probably couldn’t have told me the truth about what I was in for, even if she had wanted to.&nbsp; I am sure she had strict guidelines to operate under.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">TBOBB gets right to the root of this terrible epidemic- women are basically forced to give away their birthing power and choices to the doctors and hospitals, without really realizing what is going to be “done” to them, because it is not explained for the most part to them ahead of time.&nbsp; As I watched that poor, drained, and drugged, mother being wheeled off to her C-section, I saw myself in her- I saw her power gone, totally helpless and at the “mercy” of the surgeon who was about to operate on her, because her body “failed,” and she could not give birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I realized for the first time ever, that I felt like I had failed Ryan and failed my body, because I was not allowed to even try to give birth to him.&nbsp; Even though I doubt my doctor wanted to make me feel like that, it was recorded in my subconscious, that because my baby was breech, somehow my body “failed” at being able to get him in the “correct” birthing position, and now the only option was for her to step in and “save” me, save my baby by cutting open my abdomen and performing surgery to get him out alive.&nbsp; I felt totally duped and mislead.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Never mind that babies used to be born breech all the time, even when they had less technology.&nbsp; Joe’s oldest sister was born breech in the 60′s, and guess what? She was born healthy and Joe’s mother was just fine too.&nbsp; Never mind that one of my good friends gave birth at home to a surprise breech footling 9.5-pound baby boy in 2006.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; Her son couldn’t be any healthier today, and she was fine too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I was mad after seeing the peaceful homebirths that the state of birthing in this country is what it is, in that it denies women the opportunity to have the birth that they want.&nbsp; It doesn’t even allow for exploration of the choice, it just eliminates any choice whatsoever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I was very impressed and surprised that there were so many doctors, and OB/GYN’s in the film saying that the current system wasn’t working either. One of the doctors at Mt. Sinai in the film said something to the effect that if something isn’t done, and if someone doesn’t step in, the caesarean rate will soon be at 100%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Several of the doctors said that with a skilled midwife, homebirth was very safe, and was usually a good option for women.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I was thrilled to see </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ina_May_Gaskin" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a62699;">Ina May Gaskin </span></a><span style="color: #333399;">(the most famous midwife in the world) in the film.&nbsp; I had the privilege of hearing her speak in a town near me last May.&nbsp; She pointed out that she didn’t have a mother who needed&nbsp;a c-section in her care until birth number 187.&nbsp; Contrast that with 1 in 3 births today end in a C-section.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">One of Ina May’s quotes that she had in the movie, which I loved, was right before she gave the C-section number in her practice, was an answer to the argument that women in America are different from other women in the world, hence the high C-section rate.&nbsp; Right after she stated that they didn’t see a C-section until birth number 187, and then they didn’t see it again until a birth in the 300′s (I can’t remember the exact number she gave).&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, (and I went back and reviewed several times what she said, and wrote it down), <em>“That tells me the pelvis of the American woman is just fine-thank you very much.”</em></span></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">There was another man who was in the movie several times, with some&nbsp;powerful statistics and commentaries.&nbsp; Forgive me, but I did not get his name at the beginning, and by the end of the film I was too exhausted to go back and find his name.&nbsp; But he was the older gentleman with the short grey beard, and I believe he was a doctor, but am not for certain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">He was giving a lot of background information on birth in this country, and how they used to tie and strap women down in the hospital, give drugs during labor that caused children to have severe deformities, etc.&nbsp; He said at one point, <em>“If you want a humanized birth, get the hell out of the hospital.”&nbsp; </em></span></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">He also drew a great analogy.&nbsp; He mentioned that when he speaks to groups of OB/GYN’s and tell them about home birth, he said he always gets groans and heads shaking.&nbsp; Then he asks the doctor’s who have actually witnessed a home birth to raise their hands.&nbsp; He said he has never gotten a doctor yet, who has actually observed a home birth.&nbsp; He said they are like a geographer who is trying to describe a country that they have never been to, but are too afraid to visit.&nbsp; I couldn’t agree more.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">There was another doctor an, older OB/GYN in the film who was also a researcher.&nbsp; I didn’t catch his name, but I do remember his credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was from another country, (Ireland?), and had a heavy accent, so when he spoke there were subtitles.&nbsp; This made it very easy to write down what he said.&nbsp; He had many, many, compassionate and very true things to say about&nbsp;birth, and how we need to just stop down the road we are going and go back to square one.&nbsp; He said square one starts with the midwife.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">There were so many other important points and information in this movie.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; I didn’t know it was possible to make so many points about birth in just under an hour and half.&nbsp; It touched me deeply, and I imagine it would strike a cord with almost any woman, whether you “believe” in homebirth or not.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">It wasn’t so much a “homebirth” message, but a message on birthing, and women are powerful and are capable of managing their births the way they want.&nbsp; It shows that there are some options that we don’t hear about very often, the option of homebirth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">The only small critique I have of the film is when they showed statistics, it would have been helpful to list the source of the statistic.&nbsp; It could have been listed in the closing credits, but I didn’t watch for it. I think it would have been more powerful and more creditable to list the source of the statistic when it is shown.&nbsp; But it is an excellent film, and one that I hope to watch again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">If you have even the slightest interest in maternity care, or why hospitals and doctors do the things they do during birth, this film is a must see.&nbsp; It is by far the BEST media subject I have seen on birth.&nbsp; If you do watch <em>The Baby Story</em>, watch this.&nbsp; You will be astonished.&nbsp; I am so grateful that this film was made.&nbsp; At the very least it has helped me in the last 24 hours come to terms with the feelings I have about Ryan’s birth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I will leave you with a quote, which was extremely powerful for me, from the wonderful OB/GYN researcher in the film.&nbsp; He said so elegantly, when talking about what we are doing is clearly not working, and is not what is best for mothers and their babies was this,<em>” When you talk with certain women who still have a sort of intuitive knowledge of the importance of what is happening when the baby is born, they cannot accept that caesarean section is the future.&nbsp; They cannot accept that.”&nbsp; </em></span></p>

     <div class="date">February 27, 2008</div>	<div class="story">						
     <p><span style="color: #333399;">Here is an informative article from the </span><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/02/26/mercury_leaks_found_as_new_bulbs_break/?page=1" target="_blank"><span style="color: #993366;">Boston Globe</span></a><span style="color: #333399;">, warning of mercury leaks in broken in Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs (CFL’s). I had no idea these bulbs had mercury in them, and when broken can pose a risk of mercury poisoning especially to infants, small children, and pregnant women.&nbsp;Mercury is a neurotoxin, which can damage the nervous system in adults, children, infants, and unborn&nbsp;babies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">There were two reports done and in one of the studies, <em>“researchers shattered 65 compact fluorescents to test air quality and cleanup methods. They found that, in many cases, immediately after the bulb was broken – and sometimes even after a cleanup was attempted – levels of mercury vapor exceeded federal guidelines for chronic exposure by as much as 100 times.”</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333399;">“The study recommended that if a compact fluorescent breaks, get children and pets out of the room. Ventilate the room. Never use a vacuum, even on a rug, to clean up a broken compact fluorescent lamps. Instead, use stiff paper such as index cards and tape to pick up pieces, and then wipe the area with a wet wipe or damp paper towel. If there are young children or pregnant woman in the house, consider cutting out the piece of carpet where the lamp broke as a precaution. Place the shards and cleanup debris in a glass jar with a screw top and remove the jar from the house.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Hopefully we will never have a broken CFL, but I think the fact that CFL’s have mercury in them, and they can pose health risk if broken, should be publicized more.&nbsp; I don’t think anyone wants to put their child (or unborn&nbsp;child), or themselves&nbsp;at risk for exposure to mercury by accidentally handling a broken CFL or by leaving the area where it broke un-treated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">As the story says, hopefully they will develop a mercury free CFL in the future so we can reduce greenhouse emissions, and keep our children safe from possible mercury exposure.&nbsp; </span></p>

     <p><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/253-copy.jpg" title="253-copy.jpg"></a><font color="#333399">Ryan participated in his first concert, if you could call it that today.&nbsp; One of his preschool teachers has been teaching the kids songs all quarter.&nbsp; Today was the last day of the winter quarter, and the parents were treated to a performance of all the kids singing.&nbsp; It was so cute.&nbsp; There were about 9 kids.&nbsp; Three just walked off the “stage” altogether, while a few of the kids were too shy to sing, and just stood there, looking at their hands.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#333399">Ryan was in a singing mood and stood up and sang for all of the songs.&nbsp; Half way through one of the songs, Cole walked right up to him, and handed him a toy.&nbsp; All the kids stopped singing to see what toy Cole handed to Ryan.&nbsp; Guess Cole is still a little too young for the whole concert concept.&nbsp; At any rate it was so neat to see him singing, and I just amazed how fast he is growing up. Isn’t this my little boy who wouldn’t udder a word to a stranger, let alone sing in front of a whole group of them, just a few months ago?&nbsp; Pretty cool how he&nbsp;is blossoming out of his&nbsp;shy little self, and enjoying this new phase of his personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#333399">Here is a picture of him&nbsp;singing, while doing a hand motion that went along with one of the songs.</font></p>

     	<div class="story">						
     <p><font color="#333399">I have been waiting to see Ricki Lake’s documentary, <em><a href="http://www.thebusinessofbeingborn.com/about.htm"><font color="#b542bc">The Business of Being Born</font></a></em>, for what seems like forever now.&nbsp; When it was released last year, it was only shown in selected theaters, in selected cities.&nbsp; While there were a few showings of it in cities around me, I was never able to go.&nbsp; Then the DVD release was delayed by about a month.&nbsp; Nevertheless I put the DVD in our number one spot on our Netflix’s que, and today I received the e-mail: The DVD is on its way, and should be here tomorrow!&nbsp; Hooray!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#333399">I am really hoping to watch it tomorrow night, but Wednesday’s are a really long day for us, so I might have to wait until Thursday night.&nbsp; At any rate I am doing a happy dance.&nbsp; I will of course blog about it once I view it.&nbsp; There has been a lot of buzz around this documentary, so I can’t wait to see it for myself.&nbsp; Here is a summary of the film from The Business of Being Born’s Website:</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="lg"><em><font color="#000000">Birth: it’s a miracle. A rite of passage. A natural part of life. But more than anything, birth is a business. Compelled to find answers after a disappointing birth experience with her first child, actress Ricki Lake recruits filmmaker Abby Epstein to examine and question the way American women have babies. </font></em></p>
<p align="justify" class="lg"><em><font color="#000000">The film interlaces intimate birth stories with surprising historical, political and scientific insights and shocking statistics about the current maternity care system. When director Epstein discovers she is pregnant during the making of the film, the journey becomes even more personal. </font></em></p>
<p align="justify" class="lg"><em><font color="#000000">Should most births be viewed as a natural life process, or should every delivery be treated as a potentially catastrophic medical emergency?</font></em></p>

<p>I was not disappointed.&nbsp; I think most of the fashions were just gorgeous.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun watching the show this year.&nbsp; I knew immediately who my Worst Dressed was, and struggled with Best Dressed.&nbsp; I also loved the pregnant mommy’s-to-be looks, and have added two new categories this year- Best &amp; Worst Dressed Couples.&nbsp; Last year I provided links where you could look at the fashions themselves, but I have deicded to go all out, and post the actual pictures right here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So without further delay, here is A Mama’s Blog Academy Award Fashion Review for 2008:</p>
<p><strong>BEST DRESSED</strong></p>
<p>I really went back and forth&nbsp;on this one.&nbsp; After seeing my final two&nbsp;walk across the stage in their beautiful gowns, and reviewing several pictures of them at different angles, I <em>still </em>can’t make up my mind.&nbsp; How great is that, when there are just two simply gorgeous and radiant actresses (one is a new mom) in their gowns, one just can’t pick an overall favorite.&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed both of these dresses so much and both of their presentations, and I can’t seem to find a single flaw with either of them.&nbsp; So, I have decided not to have to decide- it is a tie- both of these are my best dressed this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><font color="#d5293a"><strong>Kerri Russel</strong>&nbsp;</font>- She&nbsp;had that <strong>WOW</strong> factor and then some!&nbsp; When she walked&nbsp;out to present, she just glowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked stunning in her champagne organza dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention her&nbsp;stunning 46-carat diamond necklace,&nbsp;accessorised with her gown perfectly.&nbsp; Top that off with the fact that she gave birth to her first child last June- 8 months ago.&nbsp; Oh, if only&nbsp;the rest of us&nbsp;mommy’s could look this fabulous&nbsp;less than a year giving birth.&nbsp; Kerri Russel hit&nbsp;it out of the ball park&nbsp;this year.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><font color="#d5293a"><strong>Hillary Swank</strong></font>- She always looks great, but she too, had that <strong>WOW</strong> factor.&nbsp; Her Versace black gown was breathtaking.&nbsp; It highlighted her body the way a dress should, and I loved how it was a classic but elegant dress, with some fun playful features too.&nbsp; I just adored the shoulder strap.&nbsp; It looked like a little butterfly or a flower&nbsp;on her shoulder, tastefully done of course.&nbsp; I don’t think she could have radiated Old Hollywood glamour any more than she did tonight.&nbsp; It was great!</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><strong>HONORABLE MENTION-BEST DRESSED</strong></p>
<p align="left">1.&nbsp; My number one honorable mention pick goes to <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Rene Zillwegger</strong></font>.&nbsp; Her Carolina Herrera silver gown, is stunning.&nbsp; I love the pretty flower on it, and the slit in the front.&nbsp; It is classic, sexy, and elegant all at the same time.&nbsp; It is the perfect dress for Rene.&nbsp; What more can I say?</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/renee_zellwegger.jpg" title="renee_zellwegger.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/renee_zellwegger.jpg" alt="renee_zellwegger.jpg"></a>Credit: Jeff Vespa/WireImage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/reneezell_leste_15551121_502.jpg" title="reneezell_leste_15551121_502.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/reneezell_leste_15551121_502.jpg" alt="reneezell_leste_15551121_502.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Steve Granitz/WireImage</p>
<p align="left">2.&nbsp; <strong><font color="#d5293a">Nicole Kidman</font></strong>- The mommy-to-be- was exquisite in her Balenciaga black gown.&nbsp; But the true show stopper for her, besides her baby bump (more on that later) was her 1,399 carat diamond necklace.&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; What a stunning necklace, and Nicole pulls the look off magnificently.&nbsp; Nicole made my Best Dressed list last year at number 4, so she has moved up two places this year.&nbsp; At this rate, she’ll be number one next year!&nbsp; Honestly, she is four or five months pregnant, and still can wear anything.&nbsp; She would make a burlap sack glamorous.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/nicole_kidman.jpg" title="nicole_kidman.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/nicole_kidman.jpg" alt="nicole_kidman.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Kevork Djansezian/AP</p>
<p align="left">3.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Laura Linney</strong></font>- If you looked up “Classic but Elegant” in the dictionary, you would see this picture of Laura Linney in her Oscar gown this year:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/laura-linney-2.jpg" title="laura-linney-2.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/laura-linney-2.jpg" alt="laura-linney-2.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Kevork Djansezian/AP</p>
<p align="left">What isn’t there to like about this entire look?&nbsp; Love her hair, LOVE her necklace, LOVE her Michael Kors silk bustle back gown, Love her bracelet, love her bag, and love her shoes.&nbsp; This is a wonderful look for Laura.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whomever her stylist was, she should give them a bonus!</p>
<p align="left">4.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Andrienne Frantz</strong></font>- I admit until tonight, I had never heard of Andrienne.&nbsp; Where has she been hiding?&nbsp; Her gold dress is just lovely.&nbsp; The train is to die for.&nbsp; She looks like she is having fun, with her smile.&nbsp; It seems like so many actress strike a pose, but Andrienne here looks like she is just being herself, and enjoying it.&nbsp; I hope we see more of Andrienne in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/actressad_steve_15550646_502.jpg" title="actressad_steve_15550646_502.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/actressad_steve_15550646_502.jpg" alt="actressad_steve_15550646_502.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImage&nbsp; <a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/1043149822_1203901935.jpg" title="1043149822_1203901935.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/1043149822_1203901935.jpg" alt="1043149822_1203901935.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Lester Cohen/Wireimage</p>
<p align="left">5.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Katherine Heigl</strong></font>- I was debating&nbsp;this final spot between Heidi Klum&nbsp;and Katherine Heigl.&nbsp; They both look red hot in their red dresses- Katherine in a silk crimson Escada gown, and Heidi in a Haute Couture red silk taffeta by John Galliano, (which will be auctioned off for charity.)&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t really like Katherine’s make-up.&nbsp; In most of the pictures it&nbsp;looks like she went to heavy on the bronzer and looks&nbsp;kind of orange.&nbsp; On the other hand, I didn’t like the wrap on Heidi’s dress, and I hated her pink dangle earrings. They just didn’t go with the dress.&nbsp; Both had awesome hair though.&nbsp; In the end I&nbsp;liked Katherine’s overall Old Hollywood glamour look more, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;love to see what she wears.&nbsp; I am just&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;disappointed in her dress selection though.&nbsp;&nbsp;Katherine has been nothing short of perfection&nbsp;on all her red&nbsp;carpet appearances, and I was expecting that ultimate WOW factor from her.&nbsp; She&nbsp;is still on the mark though,&nbsp;and you can’t hit&nbsp;it out of the park every time right?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/katherine-heigl-4.jpg" title="katherine-heigl-4.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/katherine-heigl-4.jpg" alt="katherine-heigl-4.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Jeff Vespa/Wire Image</p>
<p align="left"><strong>WORST DRESSED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left">I knew the moment I saw it-black, hideous, bat, Hefty garbage bag, curtain, awful.&nbsp; These were just a few of the words that came to mind when I saw Best Supporting Actress winner, <strong><font color="#d5293a">Tilda </font><font color="#d5293a">Swinton’s </font></strong>dress.&nbsp; One side was bare off the shoulder, the other side was a full sleeve, that flapped like a bat’s wing.&nbsp; The rest of the dress looked like an old stage curtain had been ripped down, and sewn loosely around her body.&nbsp; It was shiny too, like a garbage bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the ugliest dress I have ever seen.&nbsp; What makes it worse, is I think Tilda is gorgeous.&nbsp; She clearly is a non-conformer and with those piercing green eyes, and red hair, (she’s Scottish), she could have done so, so, much better.&nbsp; With Tilda’s red hair, green eyes- she has been blessed already with a wonderful gift from the gene pool, and she just blows it on her “bat dress.”&nbsp; Was I&nbsp;the only one who thought it was ironic that she mentioned Batman to George Clooney (her co-star), in her acceptance speech?&nbsp; Maybe she did have a bat theme in mind, when selecting this dress.&nbsp;Take this dress&nbsp;right to the bat cave, and don’t let it out&nbsp;Tilda!</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/tilda-swinton.jpg" title="tilda-swinton.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/tilda-swinton.jpg" alt="tilda-swinton.jpg"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/tilda-swinton-1.jpg" title="tilda-swinton-1.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/tilda-swinton-1.jpg" alt="tilda-swinton-1.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImage</p>
<p align="left"><strong>HONORABLE MENTION- WORST DRESSED</strong></p>
<p align="left">1. <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Julie Christie</strong></font>- I hardly know where to start- I guess the dreadful burgundy dress is a start.&nbsp; Again, the word “curtain” comes to mind.&nbsp; Or it looks like her 150 pound dog slept on it, hence all the wrinkles.&nbsp; Oh, are those supposed to be there?&nbsp; Can someone explain what is up with the light pink gloves with the thumbs cut out of them?&nbsp; Did she need the thumbs cut out so she could hitchhike to the Oscar’s?&nbsp; Is there another explanation?&nbsp; In a terrible attempt to “accessorize,” the light pink shoes, that match the light pink gloves just scream “tacky.”&nbsp; This entire outfit is just horrid.&nbsp; Please bury it when you get home, and bury it deep, so it never resurfaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/actressju_leste_15551206_502.jpg" title="actressju_leste_15551206_502.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/actressju_leste_15551206_502.jpg" alt="actressju_leste_15551206_502.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImage</p>
<p align="left">2.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Sissy Spacek</strong></font>- This outfit looks like Sissy is having an identity crisis.&nbsp; Is she trying to be a high powered business woman, or go for a feminine look with a long skirt?&nbsp; The combination of both results in a hideous ensemble.&nbsp; Her hair is terrible too, with her bangs hiding her face, and making her look old enough and somewhat like Hillary Clinton’s grandmother.&nbsp; At least she isn’t wearing gloves with the thumbs missing.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/actresssi_steve_15551026_502.jpg" title="actresssi_steve_15551026_502.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/actresssi_steve_15551026_502.jpg" alt="actresssi_steve_15551026_502.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImages</p>
<p align="left">3.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Marion Cotillard</strong></font>- Did Marion mistake the Academy Awards, where she was nominated and won for Best Actress, with an opening at an aquarium? Perhaps she thought she was going to see <em>Little Mermaid </em>on Broadway.&nbsp; Something is “fishy” in this custom-made Jean Paul Gaultier gown.&nbsp; When you are nominated for Best Actress, I don’t understand why you would turn up wearing a dress that reminds everyone of fish.&nbsp; Marion’s hair, make-up and jewelry is stunning, but unfortunately they aren’t enough to distract us from the fact that she looks like a mermaid at best, ready to dive into the water, and swim away- fish scales and all.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/marion_cotillard-1.jpg" title="marion_cotillard-1.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/marion_cotillard-1.jpg" alt="marion_cotillard-1.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Kevork Djansezian/AP</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></font>- Here is what I wrote last year about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.people.com/people/package/redcarpet2007/gallery/0,,20006775_20009281_10,00.html">Cameron’s dress</a>, when she was number 3 on my Worst list: “<font color="#00007f">This dress screams, “80’s!”&nbsp; I hate the angled flaps across her chest- it looks like a bad bride’s maid dress.”&nbsp; <font color="#333300">I can revise that this year to: This dress&nbsp; (by Dior) screams, “80′s!”&nbsp; I hate the angled flaps across her <strong>hips</strong>- it looks like a bad bride’s maid dress.”&nbsp; Cameron sweetie, lose the flaps on your dresses!&nbsp; They are repulsive. Does she have a thing for bats too?&nbsp; Seriously, flaps two&nbsp;years in a row is&nbsp;way too much!&nbsp; It seems like the flaps are moving down though- last year they were across her chest, this year on her hips, maybe next year they will be around her legs, and then finally by the 2010 Academy Awards, her gown will be “flap free.”&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/cameron-diaz.jpg" title="cameron-diaz.jpg"><img src="http://amamasblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/cameron-diaz.jpg" alt="cameron-diaz.jpg"></a>&nbsp;Credit: Steve Granitz/Wire Images</p>
<p align="left">5.&nbsp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong></font>- Again, we have a repeat offender from last year.&nbsp; Last year she was number 2, so at least she is moving in the right direction.&nbsp; Her white snake-skin trimmed dress just doesn’t pull it off.&nbsp; I also hate the side bare skin that peeps through the snake-skin waist.&nbsp; It looks like she got in a fight with a python and won.&nbsp; Jennifer also looks like she is dire need of a bra that can support the girls properly, instead of letting the <strike>dead python skin</strike> waist band do the work.&nbsp; Hopefully by next year, she will have worked out the kinks or gets a new stylist, and while I doubt she’ll be on the Best Dressed list, perhaps she will finally work her way off of the Worst Dressed one.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>BEST DRESSED COUPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><font color="#d5293a"><strong>Patrick Dempsey</strong></font> (McDreamy) &amp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Jillian Fink</strong></font>- Without a doubt, this was the best dressed couple of the night.&nbsp; I love his tuxedo- he just looks so handsome, and her dress is perfect.&nbsp; Jillian is a new mommy too,&nbsp;having had&nbsp;twin boys, just over a year ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love how her black evening bag accessorizes with his tux.&nbsp; Hopefully we’ll see lots more of this elegant and stylish couple on the red carpet.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><strong>WORST DRESSED COUPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><strong><font color="#d5293a">Daniel Day Lewis</font></strong> &amp; <font color="#d5293a"><strong>Rebecca Miller</strong></font>- After seeing the striking fashion couple, of Patrick and Jillian, these two look horrendous, and frightening.&nbsp; Daniel’s brown shoes just top off his unstylish tuxedo, and Rebecca’s dress- well I think the dress speaks for itself.&nbsp; It is right up there with one of the all-time ugliest dresses.&nbsp;Those red bows look like they came off a Christmas tree.&nbsp; Rebecca’s shoes are ghastly with her dress.&nbsp; Has this couple ever heard of a wonderful place called Nordstrom’s shoe department?&nbsp; When you are up for Best Actor,&nbsp;it is time to go all out.&nbsp; These two need to find a stylist fast, or fire the one they have.&nbsp;</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><strong>BEST TUXEDO</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><strong><font color="#d5293a">The Rock</font></strong>.&nbsp; In this case, I’ll let the picture speak a&nbsp; thousand words.</div>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#d5293a">BABY BUMPS</font></strong></p>
<p align="left">Since this is A Mama’s Blog, I have to include the pictures of the actresses who are pregnant and showed off their baby bumps.&nbsp; Since Nicole Kidman made my Best Dressed List, it goes without saying that I think her dress was the best.&nbsp; I loved Jessica Alba’s too.&nbsp; I didn’t like the accessories on Cate Blanchet’s dress, and thought her dress would have been great had she accessorised better.&nbsp; But they all were glowing, and being pregnant is hard.&nbsp; I couldn’t imagine trying to look glamorous too, especially for Cate, who was a double nominee.&nbsp; These actresses did all of us mommies proud.</p>

<p align="left">That&nbsp;&nbsp;concludes the review for 2008.&nbsp; I hoped you enjoyed my review.&nbsp; Let me know what you think- did I miss someone who you thought was best/worst dressed?&nbsp; Once again, I can’t wait until next year.</p>
