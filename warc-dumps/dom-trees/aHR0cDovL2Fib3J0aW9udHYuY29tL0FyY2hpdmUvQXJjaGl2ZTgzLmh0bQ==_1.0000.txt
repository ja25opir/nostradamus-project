      <br>
      When I was 17 years old I found out that I was 8 weeks pregnant. My<br>
      boyfriend with whom I was "shacking up" was a 24-year old
      physically and<br>
      emotionally abusive alcoholic. I decided to keep the pregnancy a secret<br>
      until I was beyond 12 weeks pregnant knowing that he would want an<br>
      abortion and I mistakenly thought that this was the maximum gestation for<br>
      having one. When I did tell him, he was furious and insisted that the<br>
      child be aborted as soon as possible. I told him that it was too late to<br>
      have one and he informed me that the clinic in fact performs abortions up<br>
      to 16 weeks of gestation.<br>
      <br>
      This news broke my heart. I did not want to kill this baby, but my<br>
      co-dependence and addiction to this man won out. I finally made an<br>
      appointment with the abortion clinic. When the day arrived, my parents<br>
      (who are now very much pro-life) picked me up for the drive. My<br>
      boyfriend refused to accompany me, telling me it was a "simple
      procedure"<br>
      and I would "be in and out quickly." It was a long, terrible
      drive, I<br>
      remember crying all the way up. This was the last thing in the world<br>
      that I wanted to do, so why was I going along with it just to keep this<br>
      man in my life? Why didn't I just leave him and stop living this awful<br>
      life of sin, completely void of morals and ethics? All I could think<br>
      about was the size of the baby, what it must weigh and the level of<br>
      development it was at. I had already begun to feel a bond with this tiny<br>
      life inside me. I felt like my whole world was caving in and everybody<br>
      around me just wanted to me to get rid of this problem. I should have<br>
      said no but I was too weak and dependent.<br>
      <br>
      When we arrived at the abortion clinic, my mother and I were directed to<br>
      a waiting room that was packed full of young girls. Everything seemed<br>
      surreal. Even though each of these girls was about to commit the same<br>
      atrocity as I was, I couldn't help thinking, "I don't belong
      here." I<br>
      just cried through the whole wait. As each minute passed, I kept hoping<br>
      that the medical staff would run out of time and have to send me away.<br>
      <br>
      But, eventually I was called in and given a small written questionnaire<br>
      whose purpose was to ensure that I was certain of this decision. I<br>
      slowly checked off the answers, crying and trembling with fear and<br>
      horror. I was sure that my obvious mental state would force them to<br>
      reject me. They had told me over the telephone that due to the<br>
      seriousness of this act, if they had any indication that I was not<br>
      prepared to proceed, they couldn't allow me to do so. I remember being<br>
      so surprised that this wasn't even considered. My mental state obviously<br>
      didn't matter to them, they were only interested in one thing.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of counseling me about the procedure and my emotional condition,<br>
      they gave me some "pills" that they said would "calm my
      nerves." Then I<br>
      went into the room where my child's fate would lie. There were many<br>
      horrible looking surgical tools laid out on a table beside the bed. The<br>
      doctor and nurses entered the room and none of them really talked to me<br>
      at all; they seemed rather hurried, almost annoyed with me. One nurse<br>
      bitterly told me to, "calm down, everything will be fine." I
      felt like a<br>
      burden to them.<br>
      <br>
      There was a drape covering my legs, but I could see the doctor moving<br>
      about quickly and roughly. I could feel a lot of cramping in my abdomen<br>
      and I realized that it was the sharp tools ripping apart my child. I<br>
      imagined them first removing the arms, then the legs and the head. Then,<br>
      I watched as a vacuum machine with a tube attached to it began sucking<br>
      out the pieces of this little body. The tube was actually clear so I<br>
      could see a tremendous amount of blood and clumpy masses passing through<br>
      it. The pain was unspeakable, both physically and emotionally. The<br>
      machine was loud and the suction made the most gruesome sound that I will<br>
      never forget. I would rather listen to the sound of a dentist's drill in<br>
      my ear for eternity than to hear that sound ever again for even a moment;<br>
      the gruesome sound of a baby being sucked from its' mother's womb.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure took a significant amount of time, and I found out the<br>
      reason why after it was over. With sarcasm, the apathetic doctor told<br>
      me, "Well, you were a lot further along than 16 weeks." It turns
      out<br>
      that I was actually 18 to 20 weeks pregnant.<br>
      <br>
      A nurse then told me that I could use an adjacent bathroom to clean up.<br>
      I slid off the bed and felt so weary, in shock and in pain that my mother<br>
      had to hold me up. As I slowly made my way toward the bathroom, I looked<br>
      down and saw a drop of my blood about the size of a half-dollar fall to<br>
      the floor. Seeing that blood clarified what I had done and I will never<br>
      forget it. That was all that was left of my child. That was it.<br>
      <br>
      I discarded my baby at a clinic of death that night, brutally murdered<br>
      and left to rot in a sink. That child did not deserve that heinous<br>
      murder. They told me the recovery time would be a couple of days with<br>
      some mild cramping and light bleeding. Well, this was totally<br>
      downplayed, when in fact there were several days of significant abdominal<br>
      pain and an extraordinary amount of bleeding, so much that I had to wear<br>
      diapers for a week. It's funny, they informed me about the cost of the<br>
      abortion and the amount of time it should take to be completed, but what<br>
      they didn't tell me about was the nightmares I would have for months<br>
      afterwards or the tremendous shame that I would feel. They didn't tell<br>
      me that I would be riddled with guilt and regret for the rest of my life<br>
      and fear of being able to give a healthy birth in the future. The guilt,<br>
      shame and fear that I feel are minute compared to the brutality that I<br>
      condemned my unborn child to, but it's odd how the Pro-Choicer's<br>
      illustrate this horror as a simple procedure when the truth is that it is<br>
      nothing short of a brutal massacre of a human life.<br>
      <br>
      I will now have to live with the choice I made for the rest of my life.<br>
      I allowed a "doctor of death" to enter my womb, literally tear
      my child<br>
      apart and suck it out of my body. This baby never had a chance to smile,<br>
      dream, laugh or cry. His or her life was savagely snuffed out. Is this<br>
      what Pro-Choice means? That you have the choice to have your unborn<br>
      human baby diced up and violently sucked out of your body and down a sink<br>
      drain?<br>
      <br>
      The sole purpose of that abortion clinic is to murder human babies,<br>
      herding women through like cattle, not so far off from what Hitler did in<br>
      WWII. They did not halt the procedure upon observing my obvious mental<br>
      state proving that there was absolutely no concern for this irreversible<br>
      decision that I was about to undertake. They were cold and ill mannered<br>
      during the procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Women have been so blessed by God with the most beautiful gift of being<br>
      the caretaker of life; unfortunately the world has given them the right<br>
      to end life. This should not be a right of women but rather illegal as<br>
      it is cold-blooded murder in the first degree.<br>
      <br>
      I am now 29 years old, married to a loving, devoted husband and have a<br>
      beautiful little girl whom I treasure with all my heart. And on May 21<br>
      of this year, I gave my heart to Christ. I was saved and delivered from<br>
      evil. My Lord forgave me of my sins and for the first time in my life, I<br>
      am truly happy. It will continue to be a journey of healing, but now<br>
      that I have Christ in my life, everything is possible. He has given me<br>
      an Amazing Grace and a new life. He's also given me immeasurable<br>
      strength, love and guidance. Although the sin I committed on March 15,<br>
      1989 remains fresh in my mind, my old life also seems a distant memory as<br>
      I embark on my walk with Jesus.<br>

      <p>Good morning,</p>
      </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">I just wanted to let you know that I think your site is very
      informative. I have to admit that I returned several times to view the
      pictures, because it is just so hard to believe that this kind of thing is
      happening...It just seemed so unreal. You know, the lies they have been
      telling us for just about ever..."It's just a blob...or, it's just a
      bunch of cells, it's not a baby" I mourn for all of the precious lost
      lives. The pictures all made me sad to the point of tears, but one
      particular page just tore me up to the point of bawling uncontrollably.
      Even though I have seen it more than once. It has had the same effect w/
      each viewing. The particular group of pics: </font><a href="http://www.abortiontv.com/AbortionPictures6.htm"><font face="Arial" size="2">http://www.abortiontv.com/AbortionPictures6.htm</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p>Especially the one in the middle, where that awful person is holding
      the arm of that sweet lil' soul who was ripped from limb to limb and was
      decapitated. You could see he would have been a perfect little boy, who
      appeared to be almost large enough to have survived outside of the womb,
      if given a chance to be born. WHO could DO such a thing and wake up in the
      morning and look in the mirror? What an evil and awful soul....I only hope
      they (these awful abortionist/murderers) suffer the same fate in hell some
      day. I was blind, now I see! Thanks for opening up my eyes, although I
      don't know how I could not have seen...I look at my 3 beautiful children,
      and just thank God for the miracle of life.</p>

      <p><font size="2">Today is my son's birthday. I now look back a little&nbsp;
      over a year and a half ago when I first found out that I was pregnant. I
      thought of how desperate I was then and how my life had stopped abruptly
      with that same news. I had gotten pregnant in the most "inconvenient"
      time in my life...I was about to return to college, I had no money to my
      name, and worst of all, the man I had been dating was just in town
      temporarily to complete a job for his company. In other words, neither he
      or myself had plans for a&nbsp; family. I found out (about being pregnant)
      exactly two months after we first met. I didn't want to tell him.&nbsp; I
      told my family and they were upset but supportive (well, not my father). I
      looked up in the phonebook about abortion services. I couldn't believe I
      was doing this. I also couldn't believe how easy it<br>
      was to get in touch with an abortion clinic. When I made my appointment
      for the following month for the "procedure", I was overwhelmed
      by the impartialness of the receptionist. I could tell that she was definitely
      used to these calls. My cousin had underwent an abortion a few years
      earlier and when I asked her what happens in the clinic she would not say
      anything to me until I had made my choice whether to keep the baby. After
      the initial shock wore off, my family nudged me to tell my boyfriend who
      had just moved to another job site 100 miles away. That night I drove 100
      miles to tell him. We were both upset. He didn't want to tell his family
      and he was just as confused as me. We both thought that I should go ahead
      with the abortion since it was not the right time for either of us. Well,
      somehow during the next few week I managed to make and break<br>
      those appointments at the clinic. One night after endless talks with my
      mother I decided that I had to do what I felt was right in my heart. I
      told my mother that I was going to keep this baby. It was only then<br>
      that she told me the answer to my question that I had asked two months
      earlier about the experience of being in an abortion clinic. She knew what
      it was like when she went with my cousin to support her emotionally.&nbsp;
      She told me that it was cold. There were a significant number of women in
      paper gowns in the waiting room<br>
      awaiting their "turn". My mother told me that the worst of it
      all was the wait. I told my boyfriend the decision I had made to keep<br>
      this baby. He accepted my decision and told me that maybe it wouldn't be
      so bad. Well, his support was short-lived when he started to get confused
      and scared during my third month of pregnancy. I was not showing so it
      seemed like just a dream that wasn't really<br>
      happening. He told me that he wanted me to have an abortion. He couldn't
      face telling his family. I was confused from that talk and I left his
      apartment thinking that I too wanted an abortion now. I know<br>
      that the clinic I called didn't do abortions past 12 weeks. I then, at the
      urgency of my boyfriend called a clinic outside the state. Next thing I
      knew I had an appointment for the following Saturday. through that whole
      agonizing week I saw how hurt my mother was. I was feeling a pain that
      wouldn't go away...a pain that told me that something wasn't quite right.
      Then on Friday the night before my appointment, it just hit me like a ton
      of bricks. Tomorrow I would be going to a place to end my
      "problem" at the cost of $500.00.&nbsp; Furthermore, I would be
      going at the insistence of a man who clearly had no idea what I, as a
      women, was going through!! But most of all, I would be doing something
      that went against what I felt in my heart.<br>
      My heart told me that ending a life for a mere $500.00 because it was an inconvenience
      was not right. It was not right for me anyway. Different people have
      different reasons and solutions but I knew that an abortion was not an
      option for me. So I told my boyfriend that night that I had made my choice
      and I was keeping my baby. He respected my decision and I told him that I
      didn't care if he didn't want anything to do with us (the baby and I). I
      was ready for that<br>
      to be the end result of my decision. The truth is, I knew in my heart that
      if I had gone through with the abortion, we would've gone our own separate
      ways anyway. So, I told him that I didn't want to hear from<br>
      him anymore. I didn't hear from him for two weeks but finally he called.
      He told me he loved me and wanted to be a part of our life and he asked me
      to marry him. I said yes. I knew that we had a rough road ahead of us but
      we were both willing to give marriage a try.&nbsp; Most importantly, we
      knew that no matter what, we would both love our child. He eventually told
      his parents and we were married in my fifth month of pregnancy. Standing
      at the alter I felt my son move<br>
      inside me as the pastor spoke of our vows. Two weeks before I had my first
      sonogram, it was then that it seemed real and not a dream anymore. When a
      mother feels a baby kick within them, it's heaven on earth. Exactly a year
      ago today, I gave birth to our son. I stare at him in amazement at the
      fact that he was inside me at one time, growing, sucking his thumb,
      kicking and hiccupping. I still cry sometimes at the fact that I even
      considered an abortion. I can't even<br>
      say the word anymore...only write it. I am not a deeply religious person
      who spends every waking moment at church. I don't even attend church. I
      just know that this so-called "alternative" was not the option
      for me. I wish to remain anonymous but please let<br>
      others know my side of the story. Thank You.<br>

      hearts around<br>
      and I'm sure it does. I have never had an abortion and I have one little<br>
      boy who is seven and wants a baby brother or sister.. I've seen the<br>
      pictures of abortion but can't bear to watch the videos. It's crazy how<br>
      people are paying thousands of dollars to get pregnant and yet there are
      thousands and millions of babies being thrown in trashcans and murdered.
      The world is upside down. I have&nbsp; friends that have had abortions in
      the past and went on to get pregnant and have more kids later. I have
      decide to distance myself from these women. It angers me they seem to have
      no remorse for their actions and have gone on to have more kids and here i
      am at 36 almost and have been trying for 2 1/2 years and can't have
      another yet. It just hasn't happened. I have been told adoption isn't an
      option because my husband is over 42 and you can't adopt over that age. I
      really need to stay away from these women who killed their kids because
      all I get is angry when I think of them. Perhaps I'll get over it in time.&nbsp;
      Anyway, I am thankful you are all working so hard to stop the madness.<br>

      most important one is that a child should be wanted and not forced be the
      hand of fate on some one. As both my husband and I would end up resenting
      this child for the curtailment of our dreams and ambitions. as my mother

      did he give us the brains to develop abortion?<br>

      Pest</font><br>
      <font size="2"><br>
      <font color="#FF0000">Stephanie, the fact that you visited, and then wrote
      to AbortionTV (about your decision) gives ample reason to believe that you
      agree with your inner voice that says "it's wrong to kill my
      child."&nbsp; For we all know in our hearts that killing our unborn
      child is wrong.&nbsp; Women who choose to abort their children begin, and
      develop a process of denial as a means of trying to insulate themselves
      from the reality of killing their own child.&nbsp; Your letter is the
      first act of denial.&nbsp; In addition, you are cultivating additional
      denials, e.g. that you would somehow "resent" your innocent
      child,&nbsp; that some good might come out of your child's murder by using
      her for research, that your child would break up your marriage, etc.&nbsp;
      Perhaps the most egregious denial propaganda is voiced by Planned
      Parenthood and pro-death factions that "every child should be a
      wanted child."&nbsp; What they don't want you to know is that <i>every</i>
      child <i>is</i> a wanted child.&nbsp; There are 10 couples for every child
      available for adoption -- and yes, there is even a waiting list for
      children with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie, you aren't a potential
      mother -- you <i>are</i> a mother.&nbsp; This happened the minute you
      became pregnant and nothing -- not even abortion -- will ever change this
      fact.&nbsp; The only decision now is what you, as the mother of this
      child, does for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this child isn't right for
      you at this time, and adoption may be the best alternative, but abortion
      will bring two things: 1) the death of your first child -- the only life
      your child would ever know, and; 2) a spiraling cycle of self-denial that
      you will carry with you for the rest of your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2">Why did God give us the brains to
      develop abortion?&nbsp; He also give us a brain to develop H-bombs,
      slavery, torture, murder, rape, racism, religious persecution, and
      hate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same God also us a brain to develop vaccines,
      medical cures, nutrition advances, increased crop yields, compassion, generosity,
      and the common sense to know that no matter what are circumstances --
      nothing good could ever be realized by the act of killing one of our

      director of crisis pregnancies at AbortionTV.<br>
      <br>
      First off, let me say that I think it's wonderful that you're going into<br>
      nursing -- there need to be more people interested in helping others.<br>
      <br>
      You say that the most important reason why you want an abortion is because
      a child should be wanted -- and you think you'd resent this baby if you
      kept it. I'm sure that in the course of your work as a nurse, you've seen
      some "unwanted" children, children who weren't brought into the
      world in the best of circumstances. As you're reading this you, might be
      thinking that's exactly why you want an abortion -- so that no child of
      yours will have to go through hardships like that, so your marriage will
      stay strong. But the simple, biological fact is that you already have a
      child. Think again of any of those children you've seen in your nursing --
      would you suggest that they<br>
      should be killed, because their lives have been hard? Of course not! The
      child you are carrying is no less alive, no less deserving of compassion
      than those people.<br>
      <br>
      You don't mention how far along in your pregnancy you are, but if you are
      more than 3 weeks, your baby has a heartbeat. At six weeks he or she is
      moving and her brain waves can be recorded. At 8 weeks, he or she will
      react to a light touch on his or her face. He or she is already living.
      You can't undo his or her existence. I hope you will take the time to
      educate yourself about your baby's development before making any final
      decision -- I have a website on prenatal development at </font><a href="http://members.aol.com/SLV80/main.htm"><font face="Arial" size="2">http://members.aol.com/SLV80/main.htm</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><br>
      <br>
      You say you believe in choice, so let me lastly present you with another
      choice -- you can CHOOSE to give birth, and not to resent this baby. You
      can choose to accept responsibility for this child -- whether that means
      parenting or adoption. This baby does not have to be aborted or else end
      up as another sad story, another statistic. That is entirely in your
      control. So is your marriage. You and your husband can choose to remain
      dedicated to a life together even if it doesn't turn out exactly as you'd
      have planned it. It is not set in stone that if you have this baby, you
      will resent him or her, you will fall short of your goals in life, your
      marriage will collapse. For any of those things to happen, you have to
      allow them. You sound like a strong and intelligent woman -- have some
      faith in yourself! You do not<br>
      *need* to have an abortion.</font>

      </font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Stephanie, is adoption not an option in London? Your child might<br>
      not be wanted by you and your husband, but what about another family that
      would love to adopt your baby into their home? A couple who might not ever
      get the chance to experience a family. You could so easily turn your bad
      situation into something wonderful, for not only you and your husband, but
      for another couple, and for that child.<br>
      Just think about it, before you go through with an abortion. I<br>
      placed a child for adoption, and back when I had her I knew I wasn't<br>
      ready to raise a child Abortion did cross my mind, but im so glad I<br>
      didn't, because now 12 yrs later, I look forward to hearing how well she
      is doing, how she loves school, how she was baptized, and I can't wait
      until the day we are reunited face to face. You might not want a chance
      with your child now, but who's not to say that you might change your mind
      someday down the road? You are also probably trying to get a head
      financially, since you have been in college, so why go and give your money
      to someone to kill<br>
      your child, when a couple looking to adopt would be more then willing to
      pay for all of your expenses. Just something to think about.<br>
      Take care, and best of luck to you, your husband, and your child</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

      </font></font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Hi Stephanie,<br>
      <br>
      I am an AbortionTV volunteer, and also a woman who has been pregnant when
      she didn't want to be. I read your letter, and I just had to write to you.<br>
      <br>
      I wanted to plead with you to think very long and hard on the decision
      that you are contemplating -- the decision to end the life of your child.<br>
      Stephanie, abortion is murder, and when you end a life, there is no
      turning back. You may feel that this is the best decision for you and your
      husband at this time, but what about in the future? You said that you
      didn't want to have a child that you would later resent. I am here to tell
      you that when you take the life of your child, that knowledge stays with
      you forever. You may go years before you realize the mistake that you
      made. But when you finally see the awful act for what it is, you resent
      yourself. You can't believe that you could have done something so heinous
      and selfish. And I would imagine that since you are married, that you and
      your husband will remember that child whose life you snuffed out, and that
      that knowledge won't bond you two closer together, but it will be a shared
      tragedy -- a tragedy that you will possibly even blame each other for!<br>
      <br>
      Stephanie, if you are not ready to be a mom, please consider adoption.
      Don't be one of those women with the mentality of, "It is easier for
      me to kill my baby than to wave goodbye to him/her." 18 years ago I
      was pregnant when I didn't want to be. I even went so far as to go to the
      clinic to have an abortion. When I took the pregnancy test, I found out I
      was too far along to have the abortion. So by Divine intervention, I had
      to carry my pregnancy to full term, and I chose to place my son up for
      adoption.<br>
      <br>
      Do you know that that is the best thing that could have happened? Not once
      have I ever regretted giving my son life. Not once did I say I wish I
      could have had the abortion. I thank God that my son's life was spared.
      Some day I will even get to meet my son and look him in his eyes and see
      the man he has become. Believe me, that is much better that knowing that I
      willingly had him killed.<br>
      <br>
      And, Stephanie, I know that adoption is better than abortion because I,
      also, had an abortion 19 years ago. I have cried many tears over the baby
      who I will never know as long as I live. Abortion is murder, and murder --
      even when it is legal -- eats away at you. I wish back then that someone
      would have shown me the pictures of aborted babies. I wish someone would
      have cared enough to try to talk some sense to a stubborn, selfish
      16-year-old girl. I wish someone would have cried out and been a voice for
      my little baby who didn't have a voice.<br>
      <br>
      Stephanie, don't kill your baby! Please.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      Rena</font><!--mstheme--></font></p></td>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My name is Cynthia and I recently completed
      a lengthy testimony about the<br>
      abortion that I had 11 years ago. I would really like to share it with<br>
      the world in hopes of helping even one unborn child. I visited your<br>
      website, but found no links to send my story, so I am including it in<br>
      this e-mail. Please post my story and I pray that women will read it and<br>
      it will change the mind of a woman considering abortion and/or change the<br>
      view of a pro-choicer. I have no problem at all with anybody contacting<br>
      me via e-mail.<br>

      <br>
      August 18, 2000<br>
      <br>
      When I was 17 years old I found out that I was 8 weeks pregnant. My<br>
      boyfriend with whom I was "shacking up" was a 24-year old
      physically and<br>
      emotionally abusive alcoholic. I decided to keep the pregnancy a secret<br>
      until I was beyond 12 weeks pregnant knowing that he would want an<br>
      abortion and I mistakenly thought that this was the maximum gestation for<br>
      having one. When I did tell him, he was furious and insisted that the<br>
      child be aborted as soon as possible. I told him that it was too late to<br>
      have one and he informed me that the clinic in fact performs abortions up<br>
      to 16 weeks of gestation.<br>
      <br>
      This news broke my heart. I did not want to kill this baby, but my<br>
      co-dependence and addiction to this man won out. I finally made an<br>
      appointment with the abortion clinic. When the day arrived, my parents<br>
      (who are now very much pro-life) picked me up for the drive. My<br>
      boyfriend refused to accompany me, telling me it was a "simple
      procedure"<br>
      and I would "be in and out quickly." It was a long, terrible
      drive, I<br>
      remember crying all the way up. This was the last thing in the world<br>
      that I wanted to do, so why was I going along with it just to keep this<br>
      man in my life? Why didn't I just leave him and stop living this awful<br>
      life of sin, completely void of morals and ethics? All I could think<br>
      about was the size of the baby, what it must weigh and the level of<br>
      development it was at. I had already begun to feel a bond with this tiny<br>
      life inside me. I felt like my whole world was caving in and everybody<br>
      around me just wanted to me to get rid of this problem. I should have<br>
      said no but I was too weak and dependent.<br>
      <br>
      When we arrived at the abortion clinic, my mother and I were directed to<br>
      a waiting room that was packed full of young girls. Everything seemed<br>
      surreal. Even though each of these girls was about to commit the same<br>
      atrocity as I was, I couldn't help thinking, "I don't belong
      here." I<br>
      just cried through the whole wait. As each minute passed, I kept hoping<br>
      that the medical staff would run out of time and have to send me away.<br>
      <br>
      But, eventually I was called in and given a small written questionnaire<br>
      whose purpose was to ensure that I was certain of this decision. I<br>
      slowly checked off the answers, crying and trembling with fear and<br>
      horror. I was sure that my obvious mental state would force them to<br>
      reject me. They had told me over the telephone that due to the<br>
      seriousness of this act, if they had any indication that I was not<br>
      prepared to proceed, they couldn't allow me to do so. I remember being<br>
      so surprised that this wasn't even considered. My mental state obviously<br>
      didn't matter to them, they were only interested in one thing.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of counseling me about the procedure and my emotional condition,<br>
      they gave me some "pills" that they said would "calm my
      nerves." Then I<br>
      went into the room where my child's fate would lie. There were many<br>
      horrible looking surgical tools laid out on a table beside the bed. The<br>
      doctor and nurses entered the room and none of them really talked to me<br>
      at all; they seemed rather hurried, almost annoyed with me. One nurse<br>
      bitterly told me to, "calm down, everything will be fine." I
      felt like a<br>
      burden to them.<br>
      <br>
      There was a drape covering my legs, but I could see the doctor moving<br>
      about quickly and roughly. I could feel a lot of cramping in my abdomen<br>
      and I realized that it was the sharp tools ripping apart my child. I<br>
      imagined them first removing the arms, then the legs and the head. Then,<br>
      I watched as a vacuum machine with a tube attached to it began sucking<br>
      out the pieces of this little body. The tube was actually clear so I<br>
      could see a tremendous amount of blood and clumpy masses passing through<br>
      it. The pain was unspeakable, both physically and emotionally. The<br>
      machine was loud and the suction made the most gruesome sound that I will<br>
      never forget. I would rather listen to the sound of a dentist's drill in<br>
      my ear for eternity than to hear that sound ever again for even a moment;<br>
      the gruesome sound of a baby being sucked from its' mother's womb.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure took a significant amount of time, and I found out the<br>
      reason why after it was over. With sarcasm, the apathetic doctor told<br>
      me, "Well, you were a lot further along than 16 weeks." It turns
      out<br>
      that I was actually 18 to 20 weeks pregnant.<br>
      <br>
      A nurse then told me that I could use an adjacent bathroom to clean up.<br>
      I slid off the bed and felt so weary, in shock and in pain that my mother<br>
      had to hold me up. As I slowly made my way toward the bathroom, I looked<br>
      down and saw a drop of my blood about the size of a half-dollar fall to<br>
      the floor. Seeing that blood clarified what I had done and I will never<br>
      forget it. That was all that was left of my child. That was it.<br>
      <br>
      I discarded my baby at a clinic of death that night, brutally murdered<br>
      and left to rot in a sink. That child did not deserve that heinous<br>
      murder. They told me the recovery time would be a couple of days with<br>
      some mild cramping and light bleeding. Well, this was totally<br>
      downplayed, when in fact there were several days of significant abdominal<br>
      pain and an extraordinary amount of bleeding, so much that I had to wear<br>
      diapers for a week. It's funny, they informed me about the cost of the<br>
      abortion and the amount of time it should take to be completed, but what<br>
      they didn't tell me about was the nightmares I would have for months<br>
      afterwards or the tremendous shame that I would feel. They didn't tell<br>
      me that I would be riddled with guilt and regret for the rest of my life<br>
      and fear of being able to give a healthy birth in the future. The guilt,<br>
      shame and fear that I feel are minute compared to the brutality that I<br>
      condemned my unborn child to, but it's odd how the Pro-Choicer's<br>
      illustrate this horror as a simple procedure when the truth is that it is<br>
      nothing short of a brutal massacre of a human life.<br>
      <br>
      I will now have to live with the choice I made for the rest of my life.<br>
      I allowed a "doctor of death" to enter my womb, literally tear
      my child<br>
      apart and suck it out of my body. This baby never had a chance to smile,<br>
      dream, laugh or cry. His or her life was savagely snuffed out. Is this<br>
      what Pro-Choice means? That you have the choice to have your unborn<br>
      human baby diced up and violently sucked out of your body and down a sink<br>
      drain?<br>
      <br>
      The sole purpose of that abortion clinic is to murder human babies,<br>
      herding women through like cattle, not so far off from what Hitler did in<br>
      WWII. They did not halt the procedure upon observing my obvious mental<br>
      state proving that there was absolutely no concern for this irreversible<br>
      decision that I was about to undertake. They were cold and ill mannered<br>
      during the procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Women have been so blessed by God with the most beautiful gift of being<br>
      the caretaker of life; unfortunately the world has given them the right<br>
      to end life. This should not be a right of women but rather illegal as<br>
      it is cold-blooded murder in the first degree.<br>
      <br>
      I am now 29 years old, married to a loving, devoted husband and have a<br>
      beautiful little girl whom I treasure with all my heart. And on May 21<br>
      of this year, I gave my heart to Christ. I was saved and delivered from<br>
      evil. My Lord forgave me of my sins and for the first time in my life, I<br>
      am truly happy. It will continue to be a journey of healing, but now<br>
      that I have Christ in my life, everything is possible. He has given me<br>
      an Amazing Grace and a new life. He's also given me immeasurable<br>
      strength, love and guidance. Although the sin I committed on March 15,<br>
      1989 remains fresh in my mind, my old life also seems a distant memory as<br>
      I embark on my walk with Jesus.</font></p>
