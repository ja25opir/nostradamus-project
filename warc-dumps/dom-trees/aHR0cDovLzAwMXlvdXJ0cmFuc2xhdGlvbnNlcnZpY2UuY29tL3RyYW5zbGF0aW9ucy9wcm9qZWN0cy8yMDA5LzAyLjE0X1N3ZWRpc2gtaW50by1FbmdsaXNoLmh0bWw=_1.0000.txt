<h2>Details of project (correspondence with customer):</h2>

<p align="left">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<ul>
  <li>banking - needs to be high quality</li>
  <li>they require native English speakers, preference to UK, but we can polish non-UK during the proofread</li>
  <li>160,000 words over 1.5 months, till end of July</li>
</ul>

We have been asked to provide a 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/translation-tips/translator-translation-rates-charges-prices.html">competitive quotation for the translation</a> of around 160,000 words from Swedish into 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/articles/syntax_who-owns-English.htm">English</a> - the client indicated:
<br>
<br>We have a 1,000 page banking customer manual that needs to be 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/2007/translation_01.29.html">translated</a> from Swedish to English. The approximate word count is 160,000 in 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/translation-tips/formatting-in-Microsoft-Word.html">Word format</a> and I would need it by the end of July, giving you the document by mid June at the latest. The text will be pretty straightforward for an internal document. 
<br>
<br>Of course, this 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/2007/translation_01.27.html">translation</a> will require a team of high-quality mother tongue (UK English) 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/2007/translation_01.26.html">translators, proofreaders</a> and 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/Project-management/2007/project-management_01.23.html">high-quality translation management</a> to ensure 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/2007/translations_01.23.html">high-quality translations and translation consistency</a> (terminology, phrasing - completion of a standard glossary to be used throughout the text etc) - I know that the proposed completion schedule is very tight! 
<br>
<br>Karel  - if you are interested in this assignment - I would welcome your thoughts (on whether) and how you could participate in this assignment - should the assignment be placed with us (<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.31.html">translator, proofreader</a> coordinator etc) - we will certainly need additional first-rate 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.11.html">translators</a> to join the "Team" 
<br>
<br>I will need to pass a competitive quotation to the client ASAP - obviously a project such as this will require substantial forward-planning to ensure a satisfactory conclusion!
<br>
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>What we will need to ensure is absolute accuracy and fluency in English (UK
<br>English) - the manuals, being for a bank - will be printed and distributed
<br>to their clients - if there were and "Awkward" 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.08.html">translations</a> (even if they
<br>read fairly well) - the client could reject the entire 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.15.html">translation</a> [we will quality control to avoid this, otherwise you will be paid regardless].
<br>
<br>I will certainly request a sample of the text (Although I asked for a sample
<br>at the outset - and the client said that a sample is not currently available
<br>-I think that the manual may currently be - being written!
<br>
<br>I would need to view sections of text as they are produced (Should the
<br>translation be placed with us)
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>I think that we would need about 4 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.10.html">professional translators</a> - each taking on
about 40,000 words each - and separate proofreaders / checkers (perhaps 2)
to check on 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.06.html">translation accuracy and consistency</a>. <br>

<p class="style1">Hi Karel and thank you for your request. I can offer 9 to 11 
cents per English word, or what do you think would be competitive here? I have 
lived in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region></st1:place>
for 25 years and so consider myself a native speaker. I can start working on 
this June 6, maybe even before. Also I can do much more than 40 K in 5 weeks. 
Please contact me with any questions you may have. I look forward to hearing 
from you. </p>

is Swedish and because I have studied and lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Sweden</st1:country-region></st1:place> for more than 5 years. Please

<p class="style1">We are interested in partnering with you on this Swedish to 
English (job # 326159) project posted on Proz.com. Headquartered in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Hamburg</st1:city>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">
Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place>, Glossa Group has established a strong 
presence through its representative offices worldwide. Glossa Group is certified 
by ISO9001:2000 and we’re working according to DIN EN 15038. Our company is a 
sponsor member of LISA and the official representative of LISA (Localization 
Industry Standardization Association) in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> 
Pacific. We work in accordance to the official high standards of LISA. We 
coordinate majority of the European languages in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In our offices in <st1:place w:st="on">
Europe</st1:place> are working over 200 professional translators. For Swedish 
and English, we each have a professional translation team composed of more than 
15 native speakers. We only use native speakers of the target languages for 
translation projects. All of our translators are certified professionals with 
proven education qualifications in language translation and professional working 
experience in legal, IT, business, telecommunication, engineering, etc, with 
customers such as Cisco, Siemens, Raytheon, Airbus, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">
Toyota</st1:city></st1:place>
and Bombardier. All translators are highly experienced with the popular TMs in 
the 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/translating/archive-emails/2007/translations_01.13.html">translation market</a> (e.g. Trados, Transit, etc.) We are comfortable with all 
types of source formats including Pagemaker, Framemaker, etc. Our best rate is 
0.12EUR/source word for the Swedish/English language pair. We accept all kinds 
of payment methods including bank transferring, paypal, etc. I am contacting you 
from our Asia headquarter in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Beijing</st1:place></st1:city>. 
I have direct connection with the project manager in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place> who will be handling the 
project. Please feel free to reach me if any other question. Let me know if the 
quotation is satisfactory for you. We are more than happy to provide 
translators’ CVs under the confidentiality agreement. Look forward to working 
with you. </p>

<p class="style1">--------------------------------</p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">I am a certified translator from and native English speaker 
who has been working as an independent translator for some 20 years, with the 
exception of 2 years as English editor for a Nordic regional policy institution 
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Stockholm</st1:city></st1:place>
and 5 years working in-house at an Icelandic bank. The latter is now history 
after the infamous collapse of the Icelandic banking system. So I am once more 
building up my own 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/2007/translation_01.26.html">translation business</a> - in what remains of the shattered 
economy here. A fairly challenging task :-) . I do almost exclusively financial 
and legal
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/me/CV/czech-to-english-translator.html">translation into English</a> from Swedish, Danish and Icelandic. As far as 
rates go, that depends upon the text, naturally, but they generally range from 
EUR 0.10-0.12 per word. I should mention that all our 
<a href="http://001yourtranslationservice.com/Archived-emails/2007/translations_01.17.html">translations are revised 
by a second person</a> in house, then given a final going over by the translator. We 
use Trados (and Wordfast, actually, since some customers require this) and 
maintain a large, multilingual database in legal, financial and fisheries 
terminology. You can almost certainly find someone willing to work for less, but 
since much of my work must stand up in court or under legal scrutiny, I make it 
appoint to ensure very high quality. A discount is conceivable for a large 
amount of work, however. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like 
more information. Or send a sample of the text for a fixed quote on price. </p>

<p class="style1">Hi, I\'m interested in working on this. I\'m a native 
Londoner, now living in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Stockholm</st1:city></st1:place>. 
My background is in journalism, with a focus on corporate and business matters, 
and I\'ve recently been working at the Swedish state radio reporting on similar 
matters. So it follows that I\'m confident both in my ability to express myself 
in UK English and in my understanding of business Swedish! My per-word rate is 1 
SEK or 0.1 euro. </p>

<p class="style1">--------------------------------</p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">I have seen your job advertisement for a Swedish to English 
translation and I would be interested in completing this assignment for you. The 
rate that I could offer is EUR 70/ 80$ per thousand words of target text. Please 
see below my current CV. Could you let me know if this offer might be of 
interest to you. </p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">--------------------------------</p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">I am writing regarding the translation from Swedish to English 
project in the field of Banking. I am an American currently residing in
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Sweden</st1:country-region>, and I study a variety 
of Languages at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Lund</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>. I am going to 
take the translation certification exam here in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Sweden</st1:country-region></st1:place> this fall from Swedish to 
English and I would love to gain some experience in the mean time. I understand 
that an assignment of this magnitude requires a commitment of time and effort, 
and I believe that I can meet that commitment now during the time period until 
the end of July which you have set. I read economic news daily, and have a 
familiarity and interest in the banking sector. I am prepared to take on the 
assignment for the low rate of 0.07 GBP per word since I do not have a lot of 
experience under my belt, but if you see fit to do so, give me a test and let me 
prove my worth. </p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">--------------------------------</p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">I've waited to respond to see if I might receive a sample of 
part of this manual first.... I might be able to participate in this project and 
take on part of it. So when you know more about it, let's talk. </p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">--------------------------------</p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">I am interested in doing the job. I live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Sweden</st1:country-region></st1:place>
but have an American father and use English everyday, both in business and with 
family and friends. I have a master&amp;#180;s degree in international business. My 
rate is 0.10 Euro / word. </p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">--------------------------------</p>
<p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="style1">I haven't. I suspect that you are looking for something in the 
range of 7 cents (I think that is what the project I did for you some time ago 
was). What I ordinarily charge is 1.1 kr = which is about 14 cents, which is I 
suspect about double for what you expect to pay that for this. However with 
these previous files what we were working on was generally rough drafts. And 
this project requires much more precise translating, the type of work I 
ordinarily do, working with legal and financial documents (often at 1.4 kr). 
Having said that, are you expecting to receive a sample of part of this manual 
first before submitting your tender? That would give me a little better idea of 
what is involved, in particular how well-written (or not) this document is. </p>
