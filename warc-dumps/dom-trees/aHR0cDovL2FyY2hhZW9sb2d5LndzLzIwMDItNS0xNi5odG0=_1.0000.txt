Archaeologists Find Ancient Statue </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Saturday May 11, 2002 7:50 AM </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">ATHENS, Greece (AP) - German 
archaeologists digging in a Greek burial ground have found a 2,600-year-old 
statue that appears to be another masterpiece by an acclaimed - but anonymous - 
ancient artist. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The find - a nearly complete statue of a 
young man called a ``kouros'' - bears the stylistic hallmarks of works 
attributed to a sculptor known only as Dipylos after the neighborhood where his 
works were found. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">``After 140 years of excavations ... no 
one could imagine that a new work by the Dipylos sculptor would come to light. 
But it happened,'' Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, head of the German archaeological 
digs in the area, said Friday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The new statue was discovered in March 
along with other antiquities, including two lion sculptures and a sphinx, near 
the Sacred Gate, one of two portals into ancient Athens. The finds date from the 
Archaic period, which was about 900-510 B.C. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Another Dipylos kouros is at the 
Metropolitan Museum in New York. The National Archaeological Museum in Athens 
also has one. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Digs in the area have been going on for 
more than a century and fragments of several kouros figures have been found. But 
it is rare to find one as complete as the latest find, which is missing portions 
of its legs and face. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Similarities in facial features, hair 
and body type among all the finds have led experts to believe they were created 
by the same artist or workshop. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Niemeier said the newly uncovered statue 
has striking similarities to the Dipylos work in New York. When it was complete, 
the statue may have stood as tall as 6 feet 6 inches tall. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">``This find is important ... Greece, 
which is a vast archaeological area, provides and will always provide the joy of 
this kind of discovery,'' said Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Kouros are sculptures of standing young 
men, typically with one leg slightly forward. Their original use or meaning is 
unknown. Some were later used as building material for roadways, presumably 
after they lost their cultural significance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The sphinx dates back to 560 B.C. and is 
the twin of one found in 1907. One of the two lions was found in fragments, but 
the other was intact, Niemeier said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">4,000 YEAR OLD ARCHER WITH GOLDEN 
EARRINGS</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The richest Early Bronze Age burial in 
Britain has been found by astonished archaeologists.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The grave of a mature man was found near 
Amesbury, Wiltshire and contains far more objects than any other burial of this 
date, about 2,300 BC.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He has been identified as an archer on 
the basis of stone arrow heads and stone wristguards that protected the arm from 
the recoil of the bow. There were also stone tool kits for butchering carcasses, 
and for making more arrowheads if needed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick, 
Project Manager for Wessex Archaeology, what makes the find unique is the 
quantity and quality of the finds. 'As well as the archery equipment, the man 
had three copper knives and a pair of gold earrings. We think that the earrings 
were wrapped around the ear rather than hanging from the ear lobe. These are 
some of the earliest kinds of metal object found in Britain. They were very rare 
and the metals they were made from may have been imported. The fact that so many 
valuable objects have been found together is unique. This association is the 
most important thing about the find'.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The grave was found in the course of 
excavations on behalf of Bloor Homes and Persimmon Homes South Coast. Ron 
Hatchett, Strategic Land Director of Bloor Homes said 'we have worked closely 
with the archaeologists and have altered our plans to protect known 
archaeological sites'. Paul Bedford Senior Land and Planning Manager for the 
Persimmon region added 'it is impossible to predict a unique and exciting find 
like this.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The area around Stonehenge is famous for 
its rich Bronze Age burials. Andrew Lawson, Chief Executive of Wessex 
Archaeology, points out that this burial is several hundred years earlier than 
any of them. 'It raises the question of who this archer was and why his mourners 
buried so many valuable things with him?' </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Amesbury Archer is, by a great 
distance, the most well-furnished Beaker burial found in Britain. Beaker burials 
have often been considered 'rich' if they contain four or five objects, one of 
which is of copper or bronze, or of gold.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is the number of finds, around 100, 
their early date within the Early Bronze Age, the quality of some of them, and 
above all the associations between them that is particularly important. All the 
finds are of well-known types that form the Beaker package that is found across 
much of central and western Europe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In a British context the gold earrings 
(or perhaps tress ornaments) are rare, with only half a dozen other findspots 
known. The association of three tanged knives - almost certainly of copper 
rather than bronze - is without parallel, as is the number of Beakers from a 
single burial. The range of arrowheads, bracers, flints, and spatula are amongst 
the largest groups of archery equipment found together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The burial dates to the second half of 
the third millennium and perhaps nearer to 2,500 cal. BC rather than 2,000 cal. 
BC, say 2,300 BC.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This latest discovery has prompted the 
suggestion that the the Fosse Way was a 4th Century millionaires' row. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr Croft said: "It was clearly a very

considering sites on the Red Sea coast. But Cairo as a city has a charm in 
itself. The most preferred site is on the outskirts of greater Cairo, on the 
west side of the Nile about 10 minutes drive from the Pyramids which would be in
