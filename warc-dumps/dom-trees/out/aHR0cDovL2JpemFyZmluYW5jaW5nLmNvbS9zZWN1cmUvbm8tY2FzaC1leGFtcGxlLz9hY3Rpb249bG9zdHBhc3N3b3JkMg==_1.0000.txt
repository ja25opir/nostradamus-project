				<p>I was visiting a friend when his 34 year old son also stopped by to visit.</p>
<p>   Let’s call the son Sam (name changed to protect the innocent).</p>
<p>   While Sam was off in another room at the house, his father mentioned to me that Sam was a superior salesman, and out of nearly a dozen salespeople that worked for a midsized company, his son actually produced more than 40% of the sales. I asked my friend if his son had any ambition beyond sales. He said yes, that he really wanted to own a similar type company but even with his high income couldn’t accumulate the capital that would be required to start or buy one.</p>
<p>   I stayed for dinner, and during the course of the evening Sam and I got to talking. I asked Sam what field he was in. When he answered, I said that’s interesting, I have a friend in that field who just bought a company like that without using a dime of his own money.</p>
<p>   I knew that would get his attention and he asked me “How did he do that?”</p>
<p>   I then told him the story of George Thurman (another name changed to protect the innocent).</p>
<p>   George Thurman was the star of a five-member sales staff for a midsized company, producing about half the firm’s total sales. He wanted to own his own business. There was no chance of buying out his employer. But George was highly motivated.</p>
<p>   So one day George went to see the owner of his firm’s major competitor. “Look”, he reasoned, “because of the intense competition between our two firms, nobody’s making a real profit. I’ll sign on with you, bringing all the customers I can. I’ll even guarantee a minimum percentage increase in your sales. In return, I want a percentage of your business. The more sales I generate, the more of the business I’ll own.”</p>
<p>   The offer looked good to the competitor, because George was a good salesman with loyal clients. And a surplus of business would mean real healthy profits, instead of more years of near break- even operation. An agreement was put in writing. George made the move and earned a 30% interest in the business based upon the sales volume from the customers that came with him. So George earned his 30% interest without putting up a penny of his own money.</p>
<p>   About a year and half after George became a 30% owner in his new firm, he bought out the original owner’s 70% interest, again without using a penny of his own money. How did he do that? It’s called a stock redemption agreement. The original owner sold his 70% interest, not to George but instead, back to the company. The company paid for the repurchased stock over a 7 year period from the profits on the sales that George brought into the company. Since the company then retired the 70% stock repurchased from the original owner, George’s 30% was the only stock outstanding and thus became 100% ownership by George. He had become the 100% owner of the company without ever laying out a penny of his own money.</p>
<p>    Three months later Sam used this strategy to buy into a competitor company. About two years after that he completed the buyout of the original owner. Such is the power of a good no cash strategy.</p>
