    <h2>Career Success - Be a standout!</h2>
    <p>Everyday we hear about more layoffs. It is important to be proactive by 
      starting a job search before the layoff happens. While it is a smart move, 
      you must be careful. If your current boss gets wind of it you might be the 
      first to be laid off. Of course if you have already successfully lined up 
      a job, it won't matter much! </p>
    <p>There are going to be lots of people looking for jobs now. How do you distinguish 
      yourself from the others? This is a really important question. The good 
      news is that you can save months of job searching by simply using one or 
      two of these ideas. </p>
    <p>When there are lots of people looking for work how do you get noticed? 
      You must stand out from the crowd. How do you do that? Having a unique skill 
      is one way. You'll need to highlight it on your resume. At an interview 
      you will want to back it up with success stories about how the skill has 
      solved problems for your past employers. </p>
    <p>Another way to be memorable is to tell a compelling story. I recall years 
      ago hearing that someone always told the story of how he was on a plane 
      that was high jacked. People always referred to him as "the fellow 
      who was high jacked". He stood out! Of course you'll want to link something 
      like that back to one of the job requirements so it makes sense in the context 
      of your job candidacy. </p>
    <p>Another way to stand out is to take a risk. We are usually encouraged to 
      follow all the rules when applying for a job. Don't rock the boat so to 
      speak. Following all those rules makes us all alike! </p>
    <p>I loved the story I heard recently at an event where Shirley Singleton 
      co-founder of Edgewater Technology was the keynote speaker. In the early 
      80s after being laid off as a teacher she signed up for and completed a 
      computer programming class. </p>
    <p>After sending out hundreds of resumes for entry level programing jobs and 
      getting no response, she answered a help wanted ad in the newspaper only 
      to learn they had already filled the job. In desperation she begged them 
      on the telephone to just interview her even though she knew they had no 
      opening for her. She just wanted to know what it was like to be interviewed! 
      They agreed to help her. </p>
    <p>When she returned home from the "interview" there was a message 
      on her answering machine saying they were creating a job for her! Out of 
      frustration she had taken a risk and as a result she was hired. </p>
    <p>Lots of times clients tell me they are perfect for a particular job and 
      can't understand why they were not hired. One job candidate who was really 
      upset when she was turned down for a job sent a gift of candy to that hiring 
      manager telling her how much she had enjoyed meeting with the team. Several 
      months later the hiring manager called her about another job. The gift had 
      made an impression that lasted. </p>
    <p>It is important never to burn any bridges and to stay connected to those 
      you meet even the ones who turn you down. You never know who will eventually 
      help you find that perfect job! </p>
    <p>So whether you are already laid off or just think you might be, now is 
      the time to think about how you will make yourself memorable to those you 
      meet, what kind of risk you are willing to take to get a great job, and 
      how you can stay connected to those who have the potential to help you in 
      the future. Now is the time to make yourself a standout! </p>
    <p>Take Action </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What kinds of attributes do you have that make you memorable? Is it 
        a skill, a talent, a hobby, an experience?</li>
      <li>How does it fit into your career goals? </li>
      <li>What risk would you be willing to take to get yourself noticed? What 
        is the upside? What is the downside? How do you make the decision to follow 
        through? </li>
      <li>Who have you met recently that has the necessary connections to help 
        you with your job search? How do you stay connected with him/her? </li>
    </ol>
