    <p></p><p>At work this results in absenteeism, costing the Canadian economy over $1 billion per year, according to Duxbury. Plus to keep up with caregiving demands, 15 percent of sandwiched workers have reduced their work hours, while 10 percent have experienced a reduction in income.</p>
<p><b>Preparing for Caregiving</b></p>
<p>Deravian notes that she, her husband, and her extended family have had frank discussions about how they will accommodate her mom in the future–discussions that her mom has also participated in.</p>
<p>“We need to have these conversations now, not five years from now, not in the middle of a crisis,” she says. “People don’t think straight when they’re in crisis mode.”</p>
<p>If she doesn’t have all the answers, at least Deravian isn’t ignoring her circumstances. According to Ontario psychologist Peter Marshall, although many people recognize that their parents will one day need help, many remain woefully unprepared.</p>
<p>“Given the inevitability of the situation, it seems odd that we pay so little attention to how we might prepare ourselves for changes in our family lives.” In <i>Two Jobs, No Life: Learning How to Balance Work and Home</i> (Key Porter Books, 2001), Marshall writes, “We often seem to wait until problems arise … those entering the sandwich generation will find themselves in unfamiliar territory.”</p>
<p>Part of what makes multigenerational caregiving so tough, Marshall explains, is that it stirs complex emotions. “Raising children almost always takes place in an atmosphere of optimism and hope,” he writes. “We watch them grow and applaud their achievements. The hard times and rough periods rarely go on forever. Watching our parents deteriorate, we cannot help but be aware of how much they have lost … the future often seems both uncertain and bleak.”</p>
<p><b>Coping With Caregiving</b></p>
<p>Fortunately there are many ways members of the sandwich generation can cope. Find out exactly what kind of assistance elderly parents need. They’ll likely require help with everyday tasks such as shopping, banking, going to doctor’s appointments, taking medication, cleaning, cooking, and doing home repairs. They might need a hand with personal, financial, and legal affairs, including establishing power of attorney. It’s important to find out parents’ wishes regarding funerals and life support, Marshall says, and to know the location of their wills.</p>
<p>Also divide the work among family members. “I recommend being quite specific,” Marshall advises. “Just securing a commitment that a family member will help may not actually lead to any action. It can be much more productive to have a family meeting in which each person is given a list of what needs to be done.”</p>
<p>Ontario’s Family Services Employee Assistance Programs Thames Valley (FSTV), which provides support and counselling, points out that caregivers also need to take care of themselves. FSTV suggests that people let go of any guilt they might feel about taking necessary time to relax, exercise, see friends, and nurture important relationships. The organization also recommends that caregivers monitor themselves for signs of burnout or depression, and speak with a doctor or a counsellor if necessary.</p>
<p>Susan Pilgrim, author of <i>Living InSync–Creating Your Life with Balance and Purpose</i> (Health Communications, 1995), says one way of dealing with so many conflicting demands is to simplify your life. “Look at what is extraneous,” she says. “Eliminate what you really don’t want to do or don’t have the time to do anymore.”</p>
<p>Pilgrim also urges people to encourage as much independence in their parents as possible. “Refrain from doing for others what they can do for themselves,” she writes.</p>
<p>Some caregivers may seek solace in friends or church groups. Others may find help from organizations such as the Alzheimer Society of Canada (<i>alzheimer.ca</i>) or the Family Caregivers Network Society (<i>fcns-caregiving.org</i>), which offer support groups. Many employee assistance programs also offer free or inexpensive counselling.</p>
<p><b>Finding the Rewards</b></p>
<p>Clearly, minding two generations can be overwhelming. But it also has its rewards: about 95 percent of those in the sandwich generation report feeling satisfied with life in general, according to Statistics Canada. More than 60 percent of caregivers in the sandwich generation have said that they feel they are involved in giving back some of what their elderly charges had previously given to them. </p>
<p>Additionally, 70 percent feel that their relationship with mom or dad has been strengthened through administering care. While caregiving is clearly difficult to integrate with life’s many other obligations, just 5 percent of people found it to be an extreme burden.</p><p></p>
