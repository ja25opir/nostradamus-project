<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mexican archaeologists have found an 
1,100-year-old tomb from the twilight of the Maya civilization that they hope 
may shed light on what happened to the once-glorious culture.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologist Juan Yadeun said the tomb, 
and ceramics from another culture found in it, may reveal who occupied the Maya 
site of Tonina in southern Chiapas state after the culture's Classic period 
began fading.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many experts have pointed to internal 
warfare between Mayan city states, or environmental degradation, as possible 
causes of the Maya's downfall starting around A.D. 820.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But Yadeun, who oversees the Tonina site 
for Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, said artifacts from 
the Toltec culture found in the tomb may point to another explanation. He said 
the tomb dates to between A.D. 840 and 900.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It is clear that this is a new wave of 
occupation, the people who built this grave of the Toltec type," Yadeun said 
Wednesday. "This is very interesting, because we are going to see from the bones 
who these people are, after the Maya empire."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Toltecs were from Mexico's central 
highlands and apparently expanded their influence to the Maya's strongholds in 
southern Mexico. They are believed to have dominated central Mexico from the 
city of Tula -- just north of present-day Mexico City -- between the 10th and 
12th centuries, before the Aztecs rose to prominence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologists not connected with the 
dig expressed caution about drawing conclusions from one site, noting the Maya 
empire covered a wide area, with a varied and complex history.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"One tomb, even if it is very fancy, 
isn't going to answer big things about the trajectory of Maya history all over 
the place ... maybe locally," said David Stuart, a specialist in Mayan epigraphy 
at the University of Texas at Austin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Susan Gillespie, an archaeologist at the 
University of Florida, said that "the whole idea of a migration of people from 
Tula to the Maya area has been abandoned."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The jungle-clad site is dotted with 
temples and platforms left by the classic Maya. The newly uncovered tomb -- 
first detected during maintenance work in December, and later excavated and 
shown to reporters Wednesday -- is dug into the earth at the foot of one of the 
older temples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Inside, a stone bowl-type sarcophagus 
lies inside a narrow burrow, topped by a heavy stone lid. While such lids often 
bore inscriptions, this one does not; the Maya apparently began to abandon their 
elaborate writing system in the twilight of their culture.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologists also found a pottery urn 
and the bones of what they believe is a woman. Her skull appears to have been 
intentionally deformed, a practice common among the Maya. Physical 
anthropologists are now studying the bones, hoping to identify which group she 
came from.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tomb does bear evidence that at 
least one other pre-Hispanic group took over the site after the collapse of the 
Maya.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The institute said the woman's bones 
were displaced by boiled bones in another pottery urn, apparently put there by 
Tzeltal chieftains sometime in the late 1400s, just before the Spanish conquest.</span></p>

ancient China's "defense minister" unearthed in northwest China</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">XI'AN, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The family tombs of an high-ranking 
general of the Han Dynasty (202 B.C.-220 A.D.) was unearthed in northwest 
China's Shaanxi Province, providing evidence to China's military history, 
archaeologists said Friday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The tomb in Weiqu Town of suburban 
Xi'an, provincial capital of Shaanxi, belonged to Zhang Anshi (?-62 B.C.), a 
major general of Han Dynasty and he was conferred the titled of Liehou, top 
level of entitled officials of the dynasty, after helping Liu Xun (91 B.C.-49 
B.C.) to become the emperor, said Zhang Zhongli, vice president of Shaanxi 
Provincial Institute of Archaeology.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The identification of the tomb owner was 
confirmed by the archaeologists based on the discovery of the official seals and 
the seal carved with the family name Zhang from the tomb, which is only six 
kilometers away from the emperor's tomb, Zhang Zhongli said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The main chamber of ancient Zhang's 
tomb, surrounded by more than a dozen of tombs, is 35 meters long and 24.5 
meters wide, and has been robbed before, Zhang Zhongli said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The whole tomb faces the direction of 
the emperor's tomb, which shows the respect of the general toward his king, 
Zhang said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">More than 2,000 pieces of cultural 
relics, including exquisite bronze and ceramics decorations, bronze seals and 
appliances which represent the high rank of the general, had been unearthed over 
the past year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However, the body of the owners had not 
been unearthed in terms of better protection, Zhang said, without revealing the 
schedule.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The structure and size of the tomb and 
the large amount of unearthed appliances are all significant to archeological 
researches, Zhang said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The military appliances and the 
carriages might be the remarkable discovery of the Chinese military history, as 
the general was considered the "national defense minister" of the Han Dynasty, 
he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although the tombs of Zhang Anshi's and 
his wife's had been robbed and burnt before being discovered by the 
archeologists, they had provided abundant evidence to the research of the Han 
Dynasty history, he said.</span></p>

part of an Iron Age dwelling, along with pieces of pottery that we can date to 
the late Iron Age.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We also found evidence of a medieval 
enclosure further along the route and five circular, fire-scorched pits, 
probably parts of ancient hearths or kilns or evidence of charcoal production.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It is likely that the Iron Age remains 
are associated with a prehistoric roundhouse that would have been approximately 
eight metres in diameter, with timber supports and with walls and roof made with 
wattle and daub."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Paul Clifford, engineering manager at 
South East Water, said: "This exciting find, on private land in the Pembury

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"On large schemes such as this we take 
the extra precaution of having archaeologists working alongside our contractors

dating to 211 BC is oldest piece of Roman money ever found in Britain </span>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By DAILY MAIL REPORTER</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Last updated at 5:20 PM on 29th January 
2010</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A 2,221-year-old silver coin dug up as 
part of a hoard is the oldest piece of Roman money ever found in Britain. Dating 
from 211 BC and found near the Leicestershire village of Hallaton, the coin was 
uncovered with 5,000 other coins, a helmet and a decorated bowl. Unearthed in 
2000 by a metal detectorist, staff at the nearby Harborough Museum have only 
just realised its significance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One side of the coin depicts the goddess 
Roma wearing her characteristic helmet while mythical twins Castor and Pollux 
sit astride galloping horses on the reverse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">David Sprason, Leicestershire County 
Council cabinet member for communities and well-being said: 'Leicestershire 
boasts the largest number of Iron Age coins ever professionally excavated in 
Britain.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'To also have the oldest Roman coin ever 
found is something very special.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The type of coin, known as a denarius, 
was first struck in Rome in 211 BC, making the Hallaton coin a very early 
version, the council said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The coin was unearthed by a metal 
detectorist along with 5,000 other coins, a helmet and a decorated bowl. The 
previous oldest known Roman coin found in Britain was discovered by a metal 
detectorist in Berkshire last year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Hallaton coin is on display at 
Harborough Museum, Market Harborough, alongside other coins that were excavated 
at a late Iron Age shrine of the Corieltavi tribe dating to the first century 
AD. Archaeologists believe the coins were buried as gifts to the gods, with 
other finds including a richly decorated Roman cavalry helmet, a unique silver 
bowl and the remains of more than 300 pigs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A soldier or unskilled worker living in 
the first century AD could expect to earn one denarius for a day's work It is 
thought that the coin may have arrived in Britain in the purse of an invading 
Roman soldier after AD 43. But some archaeologists have speculated that Roman 
Republican coins such as this were finding their way into Britain before the 
Roman conquest and are evidence of exchange through trade or diplomacy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The finds from Hallaton were declared as 
treasure and acquired by the council with the help of a Heritage Lottery Fund 
grant. Professor David Mattingly of the University of Leicester's School of 
Archaeology and Ancient History described the news as 'exciting'. He said: 'This 
hoard has changed our view of just how significant the East Midlands were in 
this period and this coin is a good example.' 'It indicates there was contact 
between this region and the Roman Empire despite the distance between the East 
Midlands and the parts of Britain the Romans arrived in, like Colchester and 
Chichester.' The coin would have passed through many hands, he added.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'It was minted in Rome at the time of 
the Hannibalic wars and here it is turning up after what must have been quite a 
long journey,' he said.</span></p>

law code discovered in London</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Part of an ancient Roman law code 
previously thought to have been lost forever has been discovered by researchers 
at UCL's Department of History. Simon Corcoran and Benet Salway made the 
breakthrough after piecing together 17 fragments of previously incomprehensible 
parchment. The fragments were being studied at UCL as part of the Arts &amp; 
Humanities Research Council-funded "Projet Volterra" – a ten year study of Roman 
law in its full social, legal and political context.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Corcoran and Salway found that the text 
belonged to the Codex Gregorianus, or Gregorian Code, a collection of laws by 
emperors from Hadrian (AD 117-138) to Diocletian (AD 284-305), which was 
published circa AD 300. Little was known about the codex's original form and 
there were, until now, no known copies in existence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The fragments bear the text of a Latin 
work in a clear calligraphic script, perhaps dating as far back as AD 400," said 
Dr Salway. "It uses a number of abbreviations characteristic of legal texts and 
the presence of writing on both sides of the fragments indicates that they 
belong to a page or pages from a late antique codex book - rather than a scroll 
or a lawyer's loose-leaf notes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The fragments contain a collection of 
responses by a series of Roman emperors to questions on legal matters submitted 
by members of the public," continued Dr Salway. "The responses are arranged 
chronologically and grouped into thematic chapters under highlighted headings, 
with corrections and readers' annotations between the lines. The notes show that 
this particular copy received intensive use."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The surviving fragments belong to 
sections on appeal procedures and the statute of limitations on an as yet 
unidentified matter. The content is consistent with what was already known about 
the Gregorian Code from quotations of it in other documents, but the fragments 
also contain new material that has not been seen in modern times.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"These fragments are the first direct 
evidence of the original version of the Gregorian Code," said Dr Corcoran. "Our 
preliminary study confirms that it was the pioneer of a long tradition that has 
extended down into the modern era and it is ultimately from the title of this 
work, and its companion volume the Codex Hermogenianus, that we use the term 
'code' in the sense of 'legal rulings'."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This particular manuscript may originate 
from Constantinople (modern Istanbul) and it is hoped that further work on the 
script and on the ancient annotations will illuminate more of its history.</span></p>

settlement unearthed by OPW</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">KITTY HOLLAND</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">DUBLIN’S NORTHSIDE is revealing its own 
Viking past with the first evidence of 11th-century Dubliners choosing to settle 
on the north shore of the Liffey emerging in the past week.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Clear signs of a late-11th century – ie 
Viking – house have been found at a site in the Smithfield area owned by the 
Office of Public Works (OPW). Excavation works, commissioned and funded by the 
OPW, have been under way at Hammond Lane, off Church Street, since last year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some 17th- and 18th-century artefacts 
have been found since then, while evidence of a “substantial Viking house” was 
uncovered there last week, said excavation director Colm Moriarty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">National Museum director Pat Wallace 
said the great significance of the find lay in the location of the house north 
of the Liffey.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The find would be of even greater 
importance if it could be demonstrated the house was part of a neighbourhood and 
not just stand-alone. “If it can be established that there was a Hiberno-Norse 
suburb north of the Liffey, that would be hugely significant,” said Dr Wallace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Eleven archaeologists working onsite 
have dug down to reveal “latrines and ditches” as well as the holes in the 
ground into which hazel or silver-birch posts would have been thrust to make the 
“walls” of the house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr Moriarty was yesterday able to point 
out where the 11th-century inhabitants would have entered the 7m by 5.5m 
dwelling, where they would have slept and, pointing at a discoloured patch of 
earth, where their hearth would have been.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“It’s possible they were involved in 
working with antlers, making combs and that sort of thing. We have found pieces 
of chopped and worked antlers. They could then maybe have sold them out on the 
street at the front of the house.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The house is a “type one” Viking 
dwelling, as originally identified by Dr Wallace during his excavations at Wood 
Quay in the 1970s, with three aisles or sections. There is a central front 
entrance with the hearth and seating/sleeping areas on either side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It fronts on to Church Street and sits 
almost adjacent to St Michan’s Church, which also dates from the 11th century. 
The street would have been a major thoroughfare into the city from the north.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“We are also finding some evidence of a 
dwelling next to this one, so it does look like there was some kind of organised 
settlement here.” Mr Moriarty said the excavation was nearing completion. There 
would be post-excavation analysis of the findings and he would then write up his 
report for the OPW. It will be sent on to the Department of the Environment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There were no development plans for the 
site, said an OPW spokesman. “It remains to be seen what will be done there once 
this is completed.”</span></p>

moon in the state's orbit</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">California wants to register as 
historical resources the space junk (high-tech and otherwise) left behind by the 
Apollo 11 crew.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Mike Anton</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">January 29, 2010</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the Apollo 11 astronauts blasted 
off from the moon, they left behind not just the small steps of men but a giant 
pile of equipment and junk for all of mankind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some of the 5,000 pounds of stuff Neil 
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin abandoned at Tranquility Base was purposeful: a 
seismic detector to record moonquakes and meteorite impacts; a laser-reflection 
device to make precise distance measurements between Earth and the moon; a U.S. 
flag and commemorative plaque. Some was unavoidable: Apollo 11's lunar module 
descent stage wasn't designed to be carted back home, for instance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The rest was cast aside to lighten the 
load of the Eagle lunar module and allow for takeoff. To compensate for the 
weight of moon rocks and soil samples, the astronauts gave the heave-ho to more 
than 100 items, creating a veritable yard sale of high technology and lowly 
debris. Space boots and portable life-support systems. The armrests from their 
cockpit seats. A hammer, scoops, cameras and containers. Tethers and antennas. 
Empty food bags and bags filled with human waste.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Low-impact campers they were not.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"They were told to jettison things that 
weren't important. So they starting tossing stuff," said Beth O'Leary, an 
assistant professor of anthropology at New Mexico State University and a leader 
in the emerging field of space heritage and archaeology. "They were essentially 
told, 'Here's eight minutes, create an archaeology site.' "</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There are countless places on Earth that 
have been awarded protection to preserve their historic or cultural importance. 
The moon has none. But that may be about to change.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">California is poised to become the first 
state to register the items at Tranquility Base as an official State Historical 
Resource. If the State Historical Resources Commission approves the idea at a 
meeting in Sacramento today, it would be a victory for scientists who want to 
build support for having Tranquility Base designated a United Nations World 
Heritage Site in advance of what they believe will be unmanned trips to the moon 
by private groups, and even someday by tourists. Proposals to place the items on 
historic registries in Texas and New Mexico are planned for later this year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"There's a really good chance that we 
will be up there again in the next decades," said Jay Correia, a California 
state historian who manages the registration process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It's one of the most important historic 
events in the history of mankind. At first glance, it seems bizarre to even talk 
about it. But we have to talk about it. Can you imagine someone driving a cart 
over Neil Armstrong's first footprint? Wouldn't that be terrible!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Because the moon has no atmosphere, 
Armstrong's left boot print remains in the gray powder just where he planted it 
at 7:56 p.m. Pacific time on July 20, 1969 -- a mind-blowing moment watched by 
hundreds of millions of TV viewers worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">How to preserve such a treasure is a 
priority for the space heritage movement. The loose group of engineers, 
historians and anthropologists regards the Space Age the way other scientists do 
the Stone Age. It is an epoch of technological advancement and human exploration 
that scientists hope will be studied for generations to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">More than 27,000 tons of rockets, probes 
and satellites have been hurled into space. The moon is the grandmother's attic 
of space junk, home to remnants from six manned Apollo missions and unmanned 
missions launched by the United States, the former Soviet Union, the European 
Space Agency, Japan and India.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We lose a lot of stuff every day on 
Earth because of neglect, vandalism and erosion," O'Leary said. "As things are 
destroyed, we lose part of our knowledge about the past. On the moon, if you 
take the long view -- say, 100 years out -- there's a good risk that we will 
lose the information that is sitting there."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">O'Leary is one of the founders of the 
Lunar Legacy Project, which cataloged the items at Tranquility Base by scouring 
government archives. She was drawn to the issue in 1999 after a student asked 
her an intriguing question: Can federal preservation laws be applied to the 
moon?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The short answer: It's complicated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The United States is a signatory to the 
Outer Space Treaty of 1967. Though its delightful name suggests a truce between 
Flash Gordon and Ming the Merciless, its provisions are serious and clear. 
Nations own the objects they put into space, no matter where they land. But they 
cannot claim sovereignty over any part of space.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It's similar to the international Law of 
the Sea and the reason space heritage advocates are concentrating efforts on 
protecting the items left behind by Apollo 11 -- not the site itself. The reason 
they're targeting state historical registries, O'Leary said, is because federal 
officials believe they don't have jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Correia says California law allows 
listing historical resources beyond the state's borders -- even if it's more 
than 238,000 miles away. And, he notes, California's connection to the Apollo 
program -- from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to aerospace companies that did 
contract work -- is undeniable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Discarded artifacts on the moon hold 
plenty of useful scientific information. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apollo 12's astronauts understood this. 
When they landed near the Surveyor 3 lunar probe, which had been on the moon for 
more than two years, they removed hardware from the craft, including its video 
camera, and brought it back for analysis. The camera is on display at the 
Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Much of the hardware for the moon 
missions were one-of-a-kind designs, and documentation on the "craft aspects" -- 
the retooling and tweaking of equipment by hand -- no longer exists, said Allan 
Needell, the Smithsonian's curator for the Apollo program.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"For instance, the heat shields were 
filled in by hand, and defects had to be drilled out and fixed by hand," Needell 
said. "These were things that were learned on the floor on the fly. . . . The 
machine tools that were used no longer exist."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">NASA engineers working on the next 
generation of space flight routinely visit the Smithsonian to study equipment 
made decades ago -- a wheel from a lunar rover that used piano wire, or the 
mechanism for the unfolding legs of a lunar module. Much of what they examine 
are training or testing versions of items used in space.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Items that were actually on the moon are 
as rare as condors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Of the roughly 100 items from Apollo 11 
at the Smithsonian, Needell said, only some containers and the space suits worn 
by Armstrong and Aldrin logged any moon time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It wasn't NASA's mission to provide 
museums with materials," he said. "For every ounce of hammer they didn't bring 
back, there was an extra ounce of lunar sample that they could."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Only two people have firsthand knowledge 
of how those decisions were made. Aldrin, who at 80 is a globe-trotting speaker, 
entrepreneur and author, says much of it was planned in advance. But plenty of 
stuff was discarded on the fly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Items he regrets leaving are his and 
Armstrong's lunar boots -- tossed because of contamination concerns. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"My wife constructed a title for a movie 
or a book -- 'They Left Their Boots on the Moon,' "Aldrin said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He says any move to preserve Tranquility 
Base should be done in concert with a badly needed rethinking of international 
space law to create "a unified space vision" on issues of future exploration, 
commercial development, property rights and security.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Certainly there is value there from a 
historical and cultural perspective," Aldrin said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Well, maybe not everything there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"You think anyone wants the urine bags?" 
he said with a laugh.</span></p>
