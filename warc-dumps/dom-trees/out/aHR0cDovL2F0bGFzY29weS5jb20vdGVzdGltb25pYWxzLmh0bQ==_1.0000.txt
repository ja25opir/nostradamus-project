    Thank you so very much. &nbsp;This does really help me. &nbsp;You are great
    to respond as you have in the past. &nbsp;Unusual in today's environment
    where people don't seem to go the extra mile. &nbsp;I like your bulk inks,
    and this explains a lot of the problem I have seen when refilling color
    cartridges. &nbsp;I certainly appreciate your advice, more than you know.
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The only thing that is unusual is your comments about the yellow ink. &nbsp;It's
    the one I have used less of. &nbsp;I need to get some yellow bulk so will be
    ordering thru your web site. &nbsp;<br>

      </font>After reading about refilling cartridges in this Newsgroup, I took

      recommendation of one of the members of this group I used Atlascopy.com (<a href="http://www.atlascopy.com">www.atlascopy.com</a>).&nbsp; I have
      the unenviable mixture of two left hands and a can-do attitude (!), but even with two left hands I managed to fill my
      color and black ink cartridges without a problem.<br>
      <br>
      Their kit comes complete with three bottles of color ink and one bottle of
    black ink, a syringe, wiping cloth, and cutting tool (to help pry off the<br>
      top of the color cartridge).&nbsp; The kit comes in a nice clear acrylic
      box<br>
      (makes storing neat and tidy), and extremely clear directions.&nbsp; I've
      been<br>
      using the refilled cartridges for almost a month, and the output is<br>
      indistinguishable from a brand-new cartridge.&nbsp; The kit, including
      shipping, was just under $30, so it has already paid for itself.<br>

      Dear Barry,<br>
      <br>
      Just received my first recent order placed with Atlascopy for ink supplies and refill accessories, which included your
      Ink Refill Station.<br>
      <br>
      May I say how very impressed I am with the quality and value of the<br>
      products I have received and the care that was obviously taken in<br>
      wrapping them for safe keeping,<br>
      <br>
      Please thank your staff for me,&nbsp; I shall have no hesitation in recommending your company to other Canadians,<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      I ordered your products with great enthusiasm, knowing&nbsp; that I would
      be<br>
      able to save major $.&nbsp; I have the Lexmark Z31 and the cartridges for
      it<br>
      are what I consider expensive, especially when they are only half full!<br>
      I was so excited when the shipment arrived from you and I quickly got out all of the contents and went to work refilling my cartridges.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
 I
      refilled the black cartridge in about 2 minutes, and got the color one done in
              about 5.&nbsp; I discovered after I refilled the color cartridge that the<br>
      yellow had bled over a little into the top of the chamber.&nbsp; I thought<br>
      after seeing what the printing looked like that I would have to throw it<br>
      out, but I got on your website and read the help information on what to<br>
      do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
 I sat the cartridge on a wet paper towel over night and rinsed
      the<br>
      print head with warm water.&nbsp; It worked!!!&nbsp; The ink in the
      printer is even<br>
      better than the Lexmark original!&nbsp; I can't tell you how excited I am
      that<br>
      I found your product and have already recommended you to several of my friends and all of the people at the local Office Max (while taking back
              the color cartridge I bought to replace the one I thought was a dud.)<br>
              <br>
      You don't know how much money you are going to save me, and especially how much you will continue to save me!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for
      your products, I'm a believer!<br>

...... this is my third order with your company.  I now wish to say THANK YOU to the employees at Atlascopy.com.
for a job WELL DONE.  Within an hour after keying my most recent order on-line, I received a call from Sue regarding a question about my ship-to
address.  Sue was pleasant, courteous, knowledgeable, and very professional.  I very much enjoyed speaking with her.  I received my
package two days later via Priority Mail.  The packaging was neat and secure and the paperwork was easily visible and concise.  Again, a job
WELL DONE.  Your product pricing as well as your S &amp; H charges are very reasonable as well.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that if I looked long and hard enough, I would be able to<br>
find other companies with offerings similar to yours but at a lesser<br>
price.  However, I very much doubt that they would be able to match your excellent product quality, service and professionalism.  I learned long

back.&nbsp;<br>
