  <p>LAW AND THE FAMILY</p>
  <h2><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Arial">"Additional Awards for Child 
  Support"</font></h2>
  <p>Joel R. Brandes and Carole L. Weidman</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/index.jsp">New York Law Journal</a></p>
  <pre><font face="Arial">December 23, 1997<a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/index.jsp">
</a></font></pre>
  <font face="Arial">
  <p align="LEFT"></p>
  <p align="LEFT"></p>
  <p align="LEFT">FOR SOME TIME NOW, family law commentators have participated 
  in fashioning elaborate formulas to simplify the notoriously complex Child 
  Support Standards Act. Lawyers have fumbled with the calculations largely 
  because of legislative shortcomings in clarifying and defining the act. With 
  never-ending twists and turns, attorneys take great comfort every so often in 
  coming across case law that helps solve the seemingly endless mysteries of the 
  CSSA. Weary matrimonial lawyers take comfort from some recent cases on the 
  subject of additional child support awards.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The CSSA provides that where a parent is or may be entitled to 
  receive non- recurring payments from "extraordinary sources," which are not 
  otherwise considered as income, the court may allocate a portion of it to 
  child support. [FN1] This provision is mandatory. It is not appended to the 
  basic child support obligation. It is in addition to any support award that 
  may be made. These "extraordinary sources" include, but are not limited to, 
  life insurance policies [FN2]; discharge of indebtedness [FN3]; recovery of 
  bad debts and delinquency amounts [FN4]; gifts and inheritances, and lottery 
  winnings. [FN5] Of course if the non-recurring payments from extraordinary 
  sources are considered as income, they cannot be parlayed into a double hit 
  but will be excluded from the application of this provision.</p>
  <p align="LEFT"></p>
  <p align="LEFT">Either or Both Parents</p>
  <p align="LEFT"></p>
  <p align="LEFT">Unlike other support provisions, the CSSA does not confine 
  orders of this nature to the noncustodial parent. [FN6] Either or both parents 
  may be directed to make such payments. Entitlement is not automatic. Once the 
  court is convinced that a child is entitled to a piece of the pie, and 
  exercises its discretion to award additional child support, discretion is at 
  the heart of it. The court must exercise its discretion with regard to the 
  amount and method of such payments. It may direct that the amount be paid in 
  one payment or several payments. This provision is new to New York law. It 
  authorizes the court to direct a parent to make a "lump sum" child support 
  payment that would, like all child support payments, be non-deductible to the 
  payor.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">In DSS v. LaBarge,In DSS v. LaBarge, [FN7] the Family Court 
  held that a $1.3 million personal injury award did not qualify as a 
  nonrecurring payment. In endorsing respondent's interpretation, the court 
  reiterated that the statute specifically defines a nonrecurring payment as 
  only including sources not otherwise considered as income. All of respondent's 
  current income, from which child support was paid, was derived from income 
  generated by the investment of the award.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The court found no authority to order a distribution of the 
  underlying asset, since adequate income existed from which child support was 
  being paid. In laboring to be consistent with legislative intent, the court 
  noted that receipt of compensatory damages in a personal injury award is 
  intended to put the injured party in the position in which he was before he 
  was injured and that a portion of the award is for past lost wages and pain 
  and suffering. The court reasoned that this distinguishes the personal injury 
  award, and makes it less likely that the Legislature meant to include it as a 
  one-time nonrecurring payment.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">In S.G. v. D.M. [FN8] the petitioner and his current spouse 
  reached a settlement agreement as "compensation for his personal injury, pain 
  and suffering and the spouse's loss of consortium claims which occurred as a 
  result of an automobile accident." He was guaranteed $533,000 with an expected 
  payout of $1 million. The payment schedule included an initial payout, monthly 
  benefits and substantial disbursements in the future. The Hearing Examiner 
  refused to include in income the proceeds of the personal injury settlement, 
  in calculating the amount of child support, declaring the funds did not 
  constitute income pursuant to Family Court Act (FCA) Sec. 413 (1)(b)(5).</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The Family Court agreed with the respondent that the 
  Legislature intended to provide the courts with the discretion to include as 
  income items other than those specifically enumerated. It found that the 
  portion of the petitioner's settlement that provided him with payments of 
  $1,350 a month from Oct. 1, 1995, for life, could be considered as income for 
  the support of the children.</p>
  <p align="LEFT"></p>
  <p align="LEFT">Nonrecurring Payments</p>
  <p align="LEFT"></p>
  <p align="LEFT">The court held that the nonrecurring payment that he received 
  pursuant to the settlement was not "income." Relying on LaBarge, the court 
  concluded that it was not permitted to allocate for the support of the child a 
  portion of the "non-recurring payment" from extraordinary sources that 
  otherwise would be considered as income.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">In Kramler v. Kramler, [FN9] the Second Department held that 
  while distributive awards are not specifically included in "income" for 
  purposes of calculating the basic child support obligation, they appeared to 
  fall, if at all, within the category of nonrecurring payments. This type of 
  payment offers the Supreme Court the option of allocating a portion of the 
  nonrecurring payment to child support, without the affirmative obligation to 
  do so.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">In Bryant v. Bryant, [FN10] decided last month, the Third 
  Department provided further guidelines. Petitioner and respondent had two 
  children. They separated in August 1994 and subsequently stipulated that they 
  would have joint custody of the children with primary physical custody to 
  petitioner.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">During the child support hearing, ample testimony was given to 
  explore the parties' finances thoroughly. Among the families' treasures was an 
  inheritance that respondent received, which was valued at $400,000.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The Hearing Examiner ordered, among other things, that 
  respondent pay $115 a week in child support, together with an additional $100 
  payable to the petitioner in two installments, representing an award of 
  additional child support pursuant to Family Court Act Sec. 413[1] [e]. 
  Respondent was also required to maintain health and dental insurance for the 
  children, at a about $25 to $35 a week, and, to continue such insurance for 
  petitioner until the parties were divorced.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Family Court modified the Hearing Examiner's decision, 
  directing that $75,000 be placed in a trust for the parties' minor children, 
  with the income from the trust to be distributed in quarterly installments to 
  defray the cost of supporting the children. Petitioner was named as trustee 
  and was permitted to invade the principal in a sum equal to one-eighteenth the 
  amount until the youngest child attained majority. Petitioner was required to 
  provide an annual accounting. No further restrictions were placed on the 
  trust. Petitioner received the remaining $25,000 outright.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">On appeal, respondent contented that Family Court erred in 
  directing that the children be awarded a share of his inheritance as 
  additional child support. He argued that the lump-sum distribution ordered by 
  Family Court was not permitted and that the court erred in failing to treat 
  the money generated by his inheritance as "income" for purposes of calculating 
  his basic child support obligation.On appeal, respondent contented that Family 
  Court erred in directing that the children be awarded a share of his 
  inheritance as additional child support. He argued that the lump-sum 
  distribution ordered by Family Court was not permitted and that the court 
  erred in failing to treat the money generated by his inheritance as "income" 
  for purposes of calculating his basic child support obligation.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The Third Department while seemingly rejecting respondent's 
  arguments, agreed that a court awarding additional child support pursuant to 
  FCA Sec. 413(1)(e) should consider the impact that a lump-sum award would have 
  on the affected parent. The appellate court pointed out that the statute does 
  not preclude such an award and makes clear that the manner of payment is a 
  matter committed to the court's discretion. [FN11]</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The court found merit to respondent's claim that the $100,000 
  awarded as additional child support was inappropriate. It represented a 
  significant portion of respondent's overall inheritance, and Family Court's 
  decision to provide for a lump-sum distribution, although permissible, 
  required respondent to liquidate substantial assets. It also found merit to 
  respondent's contention that Family Court erred in failing to consider the tax 
  consequences of a lump- sum award and that the valuation figure adopted by it 
  was erroneous.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Family Court also mistakenly failed to consider whether the 
  additional expense in providing health and dental insurance for the children 
  warranted deviation from the basic child support obligation imposed by the 
  statute. Respondent's basic child support obligation came to $115 a week, 
  while the cost of providing health and dental insurance for the children cost 
  $25 to $35 per week. In view of petitioner's then impending loss of 
  employment, it had no quarrel with Family Court's directive that respondent 
  obtain and bear the cost of such insurance for the children. It held, however, 
  that health insurance premiums are not proper add-ons to the basic child 
  support obligation. [FN12]</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Family Court missed the mark when it failed to consider this 
  additional expense in determining whether respondent's basic child support 
  obligation was fair and just and, having failed to do so, the court's award of 
  child support was fundamentally flawed.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">At oral argument of the appeal it was brought to light that 
  the parties' son was residing with respondent. The Third Department remitted 
  the matter for a new hearing on child support, including consideration of an 
  award of additional support, and it offered Family Court "some guidance in 
  this regard."</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The court recalled that FCA Sec. 413 (1)(e) provides that 
  "where a parent is or may be entitled to receive non-recurring payments from 
  extraordinary sources not otherwise considered as income pursuant to this 
  section, including but not limited to *** [g]ifts and inheritances *** the 
  court, in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d) and (f) of this subdivision may 
  allocate a proportion of the same to child support, and such amount shall be 
  paid in a manner determined by the court."</p>
  <p align="LEFT">It pointed out that the statute contemplates reference to FCA 
  Secs. 413(1)(c), (d) and (f). Thus, Family Court may, in exercise of its 
  discretion, allocate a portion of a respondent's inheritance to child support 
  provided the award "does not run afoul" of those sections. When the court taps 
  into "extraordinary sources," it has a host of considerations under those 
  sections.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Among the factors to be looked at are the parties' combined 
  parental income and their pro rata basic child support obligation; whether 
  such an award would reduce respondent's income below the poverty level or 
  self-support reserve; and whether such an award would be unfair or unjust in 
  light of the basic support obligation already imposed.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">The court said that should Family Court determine that an 
  additional award of support was warranted and that a lump-sum payment was 
  appropriate, the court should give careful thought to the impact such an award 
  would have on respondent and consider whether, in light of whatever assets 
  respondent may hold, the award could be fashioned in such a manner as to avoid 
  invading the principal.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Significantly, in a footnote, the court expressly rejected 
  counsels' assertion that such an award may be made without any regard to the 
  actual needs of the children, because FCA Sec. 413(1)(e) did not stand for the 
  proposition that a child is automatically entitled to share in any economic 
  windfall that my come the way of his or her noncustodial parent. While the 
  facts of the case may establish that an award of additional support is 
  justified, the mere fact that respondent inherited a sizeable sum of money 
  does not, standing alone, provide an adequate basis for such an award.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">In the final analysis, any award of additional support must 
  consider a number of relevant factors including, among others the parties' 
  respective standards of living and the actual needs of the children. In 
  another footnote the court observed that any outright grant of funds to 
  petitioner, such as the $25,000 previously awarded by Family Court as 
  additional child support, would be looked upon with disfavor by it.</p>
