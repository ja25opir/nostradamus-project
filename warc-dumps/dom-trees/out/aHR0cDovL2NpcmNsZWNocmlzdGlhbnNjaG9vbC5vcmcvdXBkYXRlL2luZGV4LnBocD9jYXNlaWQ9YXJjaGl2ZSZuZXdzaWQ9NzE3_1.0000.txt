						<td><strong>Transition, Change, What's Next? </strong> <br>By Linda Werner <br> <br>These three words are part of everyone's conversations.  Not only is it part of our conversations but it seems that it is part of a new reality.  This is the time of year when parents and students are striving to finish the school year.  The kids need a change, mom is ready for a new rhythm, and many are asking themselves, "What is next?" Do I continue to homeschool?  Is it time for my children to go to school?  Should I consider putting my children in a class or program?  What do I do now that my senior is preparing to graduate and will be moving away?  <br> <br>The Bible talks about change.  Every person faces new seasons and rhythms that must be understood.  Seasons and transitions can be difficult to navigate if certain truths are not understood. <br> <br>This week began a HUGE change for our family.  After 32 years of raising children, our youngest son Andrew moved into his own place in preparation for his wedding day on May 14.  The season of caring for children is over.  Jim and I have officially entered the "empty-nest".  Is it hard?  Does it feel strange?  Are their new feelings and emotions that must be understood and embraced?  ABSOLUTLELY!  But here is what is so exciting.  When you seek to learn and grow through change and transition, you will be richer as a result.  If on the other hand you reject and resist what is next, you will miss many new opportunities. <br> <br>Today, take time to embrace your current season.  Though the homeschooling days for your family may not be over, the school year soon will be.  Take time to look at ALL you have enjoyed this year and celebrate.  Begin thinking about things that need to change for next year.  Pace yourself so you will be strong.  Take time to build positive rituals in your life in order for you to sustain the pace that is necessary to go another day, week, month, and year. <br> <br>Take time this week to come to the Life Giving Conversation.  Your soul will be refreshed when you spend time with others talking about what works and what is hard. <br> <br>Your days with your children will too soon be gone.  Will you look back and remember with fondness the time you spent?  I hope so. <br> <br>Have an AWESOME week. <br> <br> <br><strong>Where are We NOW? - Part 2 </strong> <br><a href="http://www.circlechristianschool.org/media/pdf/Now2.pdf">Read the lastest news</a> for the 2010-11 school year regarding class closings and cancellations, schedule changes, and staff teaching opportunities.  <br> <br> <br><strong>This Week</strong> <br>• Lemonade to Leadership begins, Tuesday, April 20, 12:30-3:30pm at Calvary Assembly. <br>• Life Giving Conversations, Tuesday, April 20, 6:30-9:30pm at Calvary Assembly.  <a href="http://www.circlechristianschool.org/media/pdf/10_LGC.pdf">Download the flyer</a> for more details <br>• Middle School End of Year Party, Sock Hop, Friday, April 27, 7:00-9:00pm at St. John Lutheran Church.  <a href="http://www.circlechristianschool.org/media/pdf/sock_hop.pdf">Download the flyer</a>. <br> <br> <br><strong>Life Giving Conversations </strong> <br>On <strong>Tuesday, April 20 at 6:30pm</strong> the next Life Giving Conversation will be just for women.  The focus of the conversation will be how to evaluate and decide the curriculum you will use for your children.  The evening will be led by Circle's K-8 Program director, Carla Calvert.  Three homeschooling moms will share their experience. <br> <br>• Ruth Brown is a mother of six children -- Johanna, Katie, Twins Deborah and Mary, Twins Tim and Abby, ranging in ages from 11-years-old (5th grade) to 5-years-old (entering Kindergarten).  Ruth has been homeschooling for three years and loves connecting her family's learning to God's Word. <br> <br>• Cindy Pilling, a homeschooling veteran of 17 years, has enjoyed graduating three children, has an upcoming senior, and a second grader.  Her overarching goal in homeschooling was to create family heritage and to focus on character development in order to equip her children for productive, godly lives.  She began using character-based unit studies by KONOS and within a year was representing the company throughout the southeast, a role she enjoyed for 12 years.  During this time, her personal development included learning how we are designed for learning and the Biblical model for education.  She is in her 9th year on staff as the history teacher for Circle's Foundations program and her 5th year as Academic Team Leader. <br> <br>• Ruth Rouchard has been homeschooling for eleven years. She has four children, her oldest daughter, Rachel, will be a Junior next year, her twins, Rebekah and Mikaylah are 13 and will be in 8th grade, and her youngest son, Paul is 8 and will be in 3rd grade.   Ruth understands and uses Total Language Plus and will share how that curriculum can fit into a family's Language Arts program.  Ruth's passion is helping homeschooling mothers not only understand material, but more importantly how to understand themselves and their children. <br> <br>You will leave the evening encouraged with new ideas as well as material that will be helpful. <br> <br>To register, email Linda Werner, <a href="mailto:lindaw@circlechristianschool.org">lindaw@circlechristianschool.org</a> with the dates you plan to attend.   <br> <br> <br><strong>Online Class Registration Details</strong> <br>To register for classes online download the <a href="http://www.circlechristianschool.org/media/pdf/10_Reg_Instructions.pdf">Registration Instructions</a> and begin making your class selections. <br> <br>An <a href="http://registration.circlechristianschools.org">online video tutorial</a> is available to help in the registration process.   <br> <br>In order to register you must have your family number and current student numbers.
