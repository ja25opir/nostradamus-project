  <div class="content">
    <p>Dave,</p>
<p>I learned that you had addressed this issue in your column. Below are two e-mails that Alderman Vaccaro sent to address the 23rd Ward residents and the Block Captains. I have included my response to the Block Captains. Shamefully, Alderman Vaccaro, after I had sent my response to the Block Captains (their e-mail addresses were included), sent a message to the 23rd Ward residents; however hid their e-mail addresses to prevent me from responding to them as well.</p>
<p>Tom Walsh<br>President,<br>St. Louis Police Officers’ Association</p>
<p>Dear 23rd Ward Block Captains (and other interested parties):</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that you have been told "political bickering" between me and the 23rd Ward was the reason the St. Louis Police Officers' Association (SLPOA) will no longer allow your meetings to be held at the SLPOA Hall.</p>
<p>This is not accurate on several fronts. The SLPOA has no quarrel with the 23rd Ward. The SLPOA did not cancel the BLock Captain meeting tonight. I talked with Mike Sorth by phone this evening and he informed me that the meeting was cancelled weeks ago due to conflicts several Block Captains had. Our complaint is with Alderman Joe Vaccaro; and "political bickering" is not an accurate characterization. The board of the SLPOA feels betrayed by Alderman Vaccaro.</p>
<p>The SLPOA endorsed Alderman Vaccaro when he ran for office last year. We allowed him to use the SLPOA Hall for his meetings. And until recently we supported him.</p>
<p>In return, Alderman Vaccaro betrayed us; not just once, but on several occasions he has betrayed us on "Local Control". Please understand that "local control" is a political sleight of hand for what local politicians really want ... control of the police pension system. Both Mayor Slay and his chief of staff, Jeff Rainford have said that they need to control our pensions. But our pensions are all that we have. Police are not entitled to Social Security; just our pensions. And each police officer has contributed 7% of his/her salary over the years to insure we have something for our retirement. We do not want our pensions used as collateral or subjected to the City's documented (by the State Auditor) fiscal mismanagement. We know that this is what will happen with local politician control of our pensions.</p>
<p>Alderman Vaccaro voted with Mayor Slay on "local control". He has endorsed Joe Keavney, the state senator Mayor Slay put into office, and who in return tried to push "local control" through the State Legislature. But Keavney was unsuccessful in doing Mayor Slay's bidding because his legislative colleagues realized what local politicians were really after.</p>
<p>Alderman Vaccaro walked with Keavney during his canvass of the 23rd Ward. Keavney was invited to attend a 23rd Ward meeting at SLPOA Hall that almost omitted Jim Long, the state senate candidate we are supporting. The SLPOA endorses Jim Long because Jim understands why the police pension is so important to us. It wasn't until an SLPOA employee questioned the omission that Jim was added to the 23rd Ward meeting as an afterthought.</p>
<p>The Tillies Park Neighborhood Association (TPNA) is welcome to use the SLPOA Hall. And residents of the 23rd Ward are welcome to use the SLPOA Hall. Mayor Slay's lackey Joe Keavney is not welcome. And until Alderman Vaccaro can show a modicum of respect for our position on local control, he is not welcome. In addition, given that our pension is all that we have at retirement, and is all that many police officers have paid into, "political bickering" doesn't touch how deeply we feel about local politician control of our pensions. Wouldn't you be upset too if someone was threatening your retirement?</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>Tom Walsh<br>President<br>St. Louis Police Officers' Association</p>
<p>From: 23rd Ward News [mailto:carwashdaddy@sbcglobal.net]<br>Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 2010 7:45 AM<br>To: Undisclosed-Recipient: ;@smtp103.sbc.mail.mud.yahoo.com<br>Subject: Please help me</p>
<p>Saturday I was surprised when Tom Walsh (president of the police officers assoc.)informed me that the police officers assoc. would no longer let the 23rd ward org. and the tilles park neighborhood meet in their hall. Although I am supportive of police officers that work for us, I believe this kind of bullying because I support Joe Keaveny for senate can not be tolerated. Dan Hagerty, committeeman of the 23rd Ward and President of the Tilles Park Neighborhood Assoc., turned in the keys to the SLPOA hall and is working to find a new place to meet. I have voted for many police issues (on the side of the police) I am disappointed in 'all or nothing' attitude of Tom Walsh. I hope you would help me show your disapproval of this kind of politics. Please help me in my support of Joe Keaveny. The best way I can say 'I won't stand for this' is to work harder for Joe. I will also continue to support the police in their issues as well as our fire fighters and EMS workers. I will not let one mans poor judgment pull me into an 'all or nothing fight'.</p>
<p>Please help in my support of Joe Keaveny on Aug 3rd . If you would be willing to help by working phones or by putting a sign in your yard, please call or E-MAIL me carwashdaddy@sbcglobal.net</p>
<p>Thanks for your past support of me and I look forward to working with you in the future</p>
<p>Joe Vaccaro<br>Alderman 23rd ward<br>718-0131</p>

<p>Tonight's Block Captain Meeting has been canceled due to political bickering between Tom Walsh (president of the police officers assoc.) and the 23rd Ward. Moreover all 23rd ward org. and TPNA meetings are no longer allowed to be held in their hall.</p>
