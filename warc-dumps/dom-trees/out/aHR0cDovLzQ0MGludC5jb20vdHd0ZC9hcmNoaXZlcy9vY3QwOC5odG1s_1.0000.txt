<blockquote>
<b>Events</b><br>
1871 - When Mrs. O’Leary’s cow kicked over a lantern in the barn, it was no
laughing matter. The barn, on DeKoven Street in Chicago, caught fire. The
fire spread, scorching almost four square miles, killing about 300 people
and leaving a path of destruction valued at over two hundred million dollars
-- a lot of dollars for that time.

<p>1871 - This day was one for the history books as far as fires go. In
Wisconsin, one of the most disastrous forest fires ever destroyed the town
of Peshtigo, burned across six counties and killed over 1100 people.

</p><p>1895 - The Berliner Gramophone Company was founded in Philadelphia. Record
players were not too far off in the future.

</p><p>1904 - "Little Johnny Jones" opened in Hartford, CT. The show became a hit
several times, due in part to a little ditty which became quite popular.
"Give My Regards to Broadway" was penned, as was the entire musical, by the
‘Yankee Doodle Dandy’ himself, George M. Cohan. Yetttthhhhiiirr!

</p><p>1935 - "The O’Neills" debuted on CBS. The theme song, "Londonderry Air",
opened the 15-minute soap opera. "The O’Neills" aired Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays at 7:30 p.m. In 1936 it moved to daytime where it stayed until
1943 on NBC’s Red and Blue networks and on CBS, too. One of radio’s original
soaps, it was sponsored appropriately by Silver Dust, Ivory soap and Ivory
soap flakes.

</p><p>1935 - Wedding bells pealed for a singer and a bandleader who tied the knot,
making radio history together. The bandleader was Ozzie Nelson and the
singer was Harriet Hilliard. They would make the history pages again on this
very day -- nine years later. Read on...

</p><p>1938 - This day’s cover of "The Saturday Evening Post" portrayed Norman
Rockwell. The illustrator chose to picture himself trying to come up with a
cover concept and to complete the assignment before the magazine’s deadline.

</p><p>1941 - The Benny Goodman Orchestra recorded "Buckle Down Winsocki", with Tom
Dix as featured vocalist, on the Columbia label.

</p><p>1944 - The first broadcast of "The Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet" was heard
on the CBS radio network. The show would continue on radio until 1953 and on
ABC-TV from 1952 to 1966. “Hi Mom, Hi Dad, Hi Dave, Hi Ricky.”

</p><p>1952 - "The Complete Book of Etiquette" was first published. Get your elbows
off the table!

</p><p>1956 - Lawrence “a-one and a-two” Welk was doing so well with “da boys inta
bant” on ABC-TV, that, after being on the tube for just one year with "The
Lawrence Welk Show", Welk originated another popular show called "Lawrence
Welk’s Top Tunes and New Talent". Mr. Welk wasn’t much on hip show titles,
was he?

</p><p>1956 - Legendary broadcaster Mel Allen was at the mike, describing Don
Larson’s perfect game, as the New York Yankee pitched the only perfect game
in World Series history. Larson threw 97 pitches, faced 27 batters, struck
out 11 and lead the Bronx Bombers to a 2-0 shutout of the Brooklyn Dodgers
in Game 5 of the Fall Classic. In the words of the immortal sports
play-by-play great: “How about that!”

</p><p>1961 - New York Yankees’ pitcher Whitey Ford set the World Series record
for consecutive scoreless innings, while extending his streak to 32 in a 7-0
shutout of the Cincinnati Reds in Game 4. Ford added one more scoreless
inning in the 1962 World Series to bring that consecutive scoreless inning
total to 33. The previous record was 29-2/3 innings, held by Babe Ruth.

</p><p>1961 - Green Bay Packers’ running back/kicker Paul Hornung set a Packer
records for points scored in a game: 33. Hornung scored 33 points: four
touchdowns, six extra points and one field goal. (The Packers beat the
Baltimore Coltsto, 45-7.)

</p><p>1970 - Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize in
literature, “for the ethical force with which he has pursued the
indispensable traditions of Russian literature.”

</p><p>1974 - "Then Came You", by Dionne Warwicke and The Spinners, went solid gold
this day. While the editors are poring over the proper spelling of her name,
might we add that due to some superstitious feeling having to do with
astrology, the former Ms. Warwick changed her name for good luck to
Warwicke. It apparently worked. That is, until she went solo again upon
meeting Barry Manilow in the early 1980s. Tunes like, "I’ll Never Love This
Way Again", "Deja Vu" and hits with Johnny Mathis, Luther Vandross and some
friends made it OK to be just Dionne Warwick again.

</p><p>1979 - "Sugar Babies" opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on Broadway. The
star of the hit show was also making his debut on the Great White Way.
Mickey Rooney, who had been acting since the 1930s, once again delighted one
and all with his performance.

</p><p>1984 - Anne Murray won the Country Music Association’s Album of the Year
Award this day for "A Little Good News". Murray was the first woman to win
this award.

</p><p>1990 - American doctors Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall Thomas won the Nobel
Prize in medicine, “for their discoveries concerning organ and cell
transplantation in the treatment of human disease.”

</p><p>1991 - A U.S. District Court in Anchorage, Alaska, approved a $900-million
settlement (annual payments stretched over ten years) with Exxon Shipping
Company (Exxon Oil Corporation) for the Valdez oil spill. Exxon also agreed
to pay a $250-million fine, which would reimburse the state of Alaska and
the U.S. for the costs of cleanup, damage assessment and litigation.

</p><p>1992 - West Indian poet Derek Walcott was the winner of the 1992 Nobel
Prize in literature, “for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by
a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.”

</p><p>1996 - American economist William Vickrey (Columbia University) and British
professor James Mirrlees (Cambridge University) were winners of the Nobel Prize
in Economic Sciences, “for their fundamental contributions to the economic
theory of incentives under asymmetric information.” The 82-year-old Vickrey
died October 11, 1996 (three days after the Nobel announcement).

</p><p>1998 - Outspoken Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago won the Nobel Prize in
Literature. Saramago, first writer in Portuguese to receive the award,
received $950,000. In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the
award to Saramago for work that “with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an illusory
reality.”

</p><p>1999 - Movies debuting in U.S. theatres: "Best Laid Plans", with Alessandro
Nivola, Reese Witherspoon, Josh Brolin; Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott
Thomas in "Random Hearts"; "Superstar", starring Molly Shannon, Will
Ferrell, Elaine Hendrix.
