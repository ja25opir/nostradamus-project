				<small>Friday, November 13th, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Currently, women are initiating 70 – 75% of all divorces</p>
<p>The reasons women cheat are as varied as the women themselves. Some get involved in extramarital affairs because they are lonely, others because they want to escape the monotony of marriage. Still others are motivated to cheat due to revenge after they find tell-tale signs of their husbands’ infidelity. Then we have narcissistic women who marry good men who love and take care of them but continue to fool around with other men for a sexual thrill or for material goods.<br>
When men cheat, it is often not an indication that they are terribly unhappy in their marriages. It can be compared to a man walking into the kitchen and seeing a chocolate cake sitting on the counter. It looks good; it smells good. He may not be hungry, but he will eat the cake anyway. In other words, men sometimes cheat when they see a woman who is attractive and appears to be interested, and even though there is nothing extreme lacking in their marital relationships, they initiate affairs anyway. On the other hand, women usually cheat when the marriage is not fulfilling and is already in trouble. They cheat because they feel emotionally alone or because the husband has been unfaithful.<br>
Women tend to cheat for support, nurturing and to reinforce their own desirability. They feel neglected themselves, and they decide to get emotional support, intimacy, and sex elsewhere. The women are unfulfilled sexually and emotionally. They feel they are taken for granted and viewed by their husbands simply as housekeepers, baby-sitters, errand-runners and providers of services needed for their own personal fulfillment or gratification.<br>
These are the primary reasons women stray from their relationships.<br>
SELF-ESTEEM BOOST:<br>
Many women are emotionally needy, and they sometimes seek sex outside of marriage to confirm they are okay, they are beautiful and desirable, they are sexy, and somebody loves them for the real women they are rather than for their cooking, housecleaning and child-rearing abilities. Sometimes the husband takes the wife and the marriage for granted, and she feels used. He never wants to go out for dinner or a movie. He hardly wants to talk and shows little interest in her job, her desires or her dreams. In fact, their conversations mostly revolve around home repairs and the children. A woman in such a situation is a prime candidate to seek self-assurance outside the marriage.<br>
EMOTIONAL NEGLECT:<br>
In today’s society, there is much emphasis on achievement and accomplishment, on a big house, a fancy car, designer clothes, jewelry, and electronic toys. People work hard, and they play hard, so hard they often neglect their emotional lives. By the time they get home from the job, they are used up. Often what happens is the wife will accept a booty call. There is no time or energy for a quality home life, so they get sex on the run, at home and otherwise. Many women need more than that, and sometimes they go outside the marriage to fulfill that emotional need and many women are having affairs because they are lonely for a more real relationship.<br>
 REVENGE:<br>
There is much truth in hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. When a woman suspects her partner is cheating, and the signs are always there, it brings out the worst in her. Some women admit that they have embarked upon affairs only after their husbands confessed to or were caught in their own indiscretions. For these women, revenge is sweetest when they keep it to themselves.<br>
SEEKING EXCITEMENT:<br>
Like some men, there are women who are thrill-seekers. They love or need their husbands and wouldn’t think of leaving them. However, they want more than their spouses can or are willing to provide. They are tired of the monotony of monogamy, the Wednesday-night-only or no sex at all relationship. It is a common fact that marriages grow stale after a few years, especially after the arrival of children. If the couple doesn’t make an effort to keep the thrill and excitement in their marriage, the wife just might seek that fulfillment elsewhere. She wants him to feel that he can’t wait to be with her, that he is glad to see her. This level of excitement is not very realistic. Most relationships, if you’ve been in them long enough, reach a plateau. However, there are those who don’t want to reach that dreaded plateau. When they feel that the marriage has reached that level, they go outside of the marriage to find that spark.<br>
No matter what the reason, the important point is that for most women, by the time she is considering having an affair, it may be too late to save the marriage. This is very different from what happens with men. The lesson here for men is that when your woman tells you that she is unhappy and that she needs more of your time, your energy, your attention, or your heart, you need to pay attention – NOW!</p>
<p>The Anatomy of a Woman’s Affair<br>
We know that women are the most likely to divorce in their late twenties and thirties after an average of four years of marriage.  During this time, it’s quite common for women to experience a pre-midlife crisis, which is similar to the male midlife crisis, only with an important difference – a difference that can actually make women more likely to cheat than men. There appears to be four separate stages women often experience during the course of their long-term relationships. We can call it the Anatomy of an Affair from the female perspective.<br>
Stage 1 – Loss of Sexual Desire</p>
<p>Women at Stage 1 feel as though something is missing in their lives. They have all the things that they wanted—a home, a family, a great husband—but they feel they should be happier. Over time, many women in this stage begin to lose interest in sex. It is usual for them to spend a great deal of energy trying to avoid physical contact with their husbands because they fear it might lead to a sexual encounter. They frequently complain of physical ailments to avoid having sex and often try to avoid going to bed at the same time as their husbands. They view sex as a job, not unlike doing the dishes or going to the grocery store. Some women in Stage 1 claim they feel violated when their husbands touch them.  Their bodies freeze up and they feel tightness in their chest and/or a sick feeling in their stomach. The majority of women in Stage 1 feel as though there is something wrong with them, that they are in some way defective. They are also fearful that their disinterest in sex will cause their husbands to cheat or worse yet, leave them.<br>
Stage 2<br>
Women at Stage 2 experience reawakened desire stimulated by an encounter outside the marital relationship. Whether these encounters with a new man involves sex or remain platonic, women will typically give a tremendous amount of emotional significance to these encounters.<br>
Many women in this stage haven’t felt any sexual desire for a long time. Many experience tremendous guilt and regret, regardless of whether their new relationships are sexual, merely emotional, or both. Most begin to experience what could be termed an identity crisis—even those who try to put the experience behind them. Constant reminders are everywhere. They feel guilt when the topic of infidelity arises, whether in the media, in conversations with family and friends, or at home with their husbands. Women in this stage can no longer express their prior disdain for infidelity without feeling like a hypocrite. They feel as though they have lost a part of themselves. Reflecting society’s belief that women are either good or bad, women will question their good girl status and feel that they might not be deserving of their husbands. Many will try to overcome feelings of guilt by becoming more attentive toward and appreciative of their husbands. However, over time many women will move from appreciation to justification. In order to justify their continued desire for other men, women will begin to attribute these desires to needs that are not being met in their marriage, or to their husband’s past behavior. Many women will become negative and sarcastic when speaking of their husbands and their marriages and it is common for an extramarital affair to follow.<br>
 Stage 3<br>
Women at Stage 3 are involved in affairs, ending affairs, or contemplating divorce. Women who are having affairs experience feelings unlike anything they have experienced before. They feel alive again and many believe they have found their soul mates. These women are experiencing feelings associated with a chemically altered state, or what is typically referred to as being in love. </p>
<p>These women are also typically in tremendous pain, the pain of choosing between their husbands and their new love interests. They typically believe what they are doing is wrong and unfair to their husbands, but are unable to end their affairs. Many often try several times. Prior to meeting with their lovers, they will vow that it will be the last time, but they are unable to stick with their decisions. </p>
<p>Unable to end their extramarital relationships, women at Stage 3 conclude that their lovers are soul mates because they are unaware that they have become addicted to the high caused by chemicals released during the initial stages of a relationship. Many live in a state of limbo for years. Should I stay married or should I get a divorce? This is the question continuously on the minds of women at Stage 3 – it is also common for women at this stage to attempt to initiate a separation. In most cases, husbands of women at Stage 3 will launch futile attempts to make their wives happy by being more attentive, spending more time at home and helping out around the house. Regardless of women’s past and present complaints, the last thing women at Stage 3 want, is to spend more time with their husbands. </p>
<p>The reason many women will give for their desire to separate is a search for self. They convince their husbands that they might be able to save their marriage if they can just have time to themselves. They tell their husbands that time apart is the only hope of improving their current situation. Women at this stage want to free themselves of the restrictions of marriage and spend more time with their lovers. Most think that eventually their confusion will disappear.  They think they will eventually know with certainty whether they want to stay married or get divorced and be with their lovers. Separation allows women at this stage, to enjoy the high they experience with their lovers without giving up the security of their marriages. Husbands of Stage 3 women are often unaware that their wives are having affairs. Their lack of suspicion is typically due to their wife’s disinterest in sex and in their belief that their wife is a good girl.</p>
<p>Women at Stage 3 may also be experiencing the ending of an extramarital affair, and the ending may not have been their decision. They may have been involved with single men who either lost interest because the relationship could not progress or who became attracted to another women who was single. Women whose affairs are ending often experience extreme grief. They may become deeply depressed and express tremendous anger toward their husbands. They are typically unaware that they are experiencing chemical withdrawal due to sudden changes in their brain chemistry. As a result, many will feel that they have missed their chance at happiness due to their indecisiveness. </p>
<p>Believing they have become more aware of what they want and need from a mate, women at this stage will often place the utmost importance on finding a new relationship that will give them the feeling they experienced in their affairs. A new relationship with a new partner will also represent a clean slate, a chance for these women to regain their good girl status. Some women will search for new partners during their separations. Others will return to their marriages, but not emotionally and still continue to search. Some women will resume sporadic sexual relations with their husbands in an effort to safeguard their marriage until they make a decision. Although they are often not sexually attracted to their husbands, desire is temporarily rekindled when they suspect their husbands are unfaithful, are contemplating infidelity, or when their husbands show signs of moving on.<br>
 Stage 4<br>
The women in stage four included those who chose to stay married and continue their affairs and those who chose to divorce. Some of the women who continued their affairs stated that marital sex was improved by maintaining the extramarital relationship. Some thought the lover was a soul mate, but for one reason or another did not leave their husband and did not feel torn between the two. Others realized that their feelings were intensified by not sharing day-to-day living arrangements with their lover. Almost all of the women in this latter category were having affairs with married men. They believed their affairs could continue indefinitely without disrupting either partner’s primary relationship.  </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I have some shocking news. In a new study conducted by marriage counselor M. Gary Neuman, and reported in his book The Truth About Cheating, it’s estimated that one in 2.7 men will cheat—and most of their wives will never know about it. This article is about why men cheat, but don’t get me wrong, women do as well, but not in as great numbers. Although wives can factor into affairs, Gary’s book is not about blaming wives it is about empowering them. I tell my clients who cheat “You made a choice; you had a number of other options; I mean, cheating is ridiculous. It’s wrong. And you can’t justify it. </p>
<p>What’s the number one reason men cheat? Ninety-two percent of men said it wasn’t primarily about the sex. The majority said it was an emotional disconnection, specifically a sense of feeling under appreciated. A lack of thoughtful gestures, Gary says. Men are very emotional beings. They just don’t look like that. Or they don’t seem like that. Or they don’t tell you that.</p>
<p>With daily worries like bills, children and chores, it’s easy for couples to drift away from appreciating one another like they should. The Other Woman often make the man feel better about himself. She makes him feel different. Makes them feel appreciated and admired.. Men look strong, powerful, and capable, but on the inside, they’re insecure like everybody else. They’re searching and looking for somebody to build them up to make them feel valued. How often does a man cheat on his wife with a woman who’s more attractive? Not as often as you may think. In most cases, the wives are often surprised that they are better looking then the Other Woman. Again, it is often not about sex.</p>
<p>Men have a winning mentality, Gary says. Just think about how the man in your life acts while watching his favorite sports teams. He loves to win. He has ownership in the team as long as they’re in the game, even to the very end, they’ll watch. Once it’s a blowout and he knows his team can’t win, television goes off. What a lot of men said to Gary through his research was, I just felt like I couldn’t win. Now these guys might not have been great guys to live with, but if you want to secure your relationship and have the knowledge of men, make them feel like they’re winning with the things that they do for you.”</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to praise your partner or tell him that you appreciate what he does. We get married because we want one person in the world to really think we’re wonderful for doing all the things that we do. We all want the same thing, and the more we give it, the more we get it in return. I use this same model with my couples in Imago Relationship Counseling. If you want your needs to be met by your partner, it is important that his or her needs be met as well.</p>
<p>Only 7 percent of men who strayed told their wives without being asked. Fifty-five percent of men in Gary’s study have either not told their wives or lied after being confronted with hard evidence. I kind of tell people, ‘If you’re going to wait for him to come tell you, go buy a lottery ticket, because you like playing against the odds, Gary says. There is a moment where every woman has to look at her husband and say, simply, ‘Look. The fact is that I think you may be cheating. I’ll trust you at your word. I have no choice. But there’s something wrong with us.</p>
<p>Just as the little things are often signs that something is wrong, the little things can also help rebuild relationships, for example, if a man tries to make breakfast and burns the toast, stay positive. Men want to feel like they’re pleasing their wives. … When you give him the message mainly that he screwed up, then unbelievably, it makes him feel insecure. He thinks, I can’t win. Engender the good feeling of the trying and the effort that he’s made. That’s where the love really is.</p>
<p>Gary says the truth can be very difficult for women to face because it could be the end of her marriage and the beginning of a painful divorce. Gary says the cheater’s lying is really the ultimate betrayal. I say to men, look, do yourself a bigger favor, be honest with your wife when you’re just beginning to get interested in somebody else. Sit down with your wife and say Listen. Something is wrong, Gary says. I concur 100% and I teach my clients to affair proof their relationships!</p>
<p>Most affairs start at work or through a hobby. It begins as an emotional relationship. There’s a friendship that develops. It’s not just looking for the sex. We all have this picture of cheaters as the bad guys. They’re horrible, rotten, not nice. No, they can be nice people who get lost, who do the wrong thing—and they can be your husband.</p>
<p>If you suspect your husband is cheating, their are unobtrusive ways of investigating, such as looking at cell phone records or computer histories, or try using an automobile GPS tracking device if necessary. But first, find out if GPS tracking is legal in your state. Here are several signs that a husband is cheating:<br>
•	He spends more time away from the house.<br>
•	You have less sex. (or occasionally more)<br>
•	He avoids contact.<br>
•	He does not answer his cell phone.<br>
•	He criticizes you more.<br>
Not only are these the signs that he’s cheating, Gary says, but they’re the same signs for when he is about to cheat. So if he’s starting to do that, either he’s cheating or you should bring it up because he might be about to cheat. It’s a precursor. Another precursor to a man’s cheating is when he suddenly cannot stop talking about another woman. </p>
<p>Men often try to hide their cheating, even if the relationship has ended, because they cannot bear the guilt and are trying to cover it up. However,  if their wives confront them, they need to come clean, but not necessarily about everything. There’s a very negative effect to telling everything, even if you as a woman must know, Gary says. The best questions for a woman to ask are ones that will help her get a full picture of what happened and how to protect herself in the future. These are questions like: Who is she? Where did you meet her? How long ago did it happen? Do you still have anything to do with her? Do you still love her? The questions to avoid are those that focus on specifics. A cheated-on woman should absolutely not ask: Did you tell her the same things you told me? Was she better at sex than me? What color underwear did she wear?</p>
<p>It’s very hard to get further past that when you have all that information, Gary says. And here’s the bottom line that a woman has to understand if you’re going forward in this relationship and he’s confessing and he’s remorseful, and that is he was screwed up before. He made a mistake. He knows that. … But right now he’s saying, ‘I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I really messed up.</p>
<p>In his research, Gary uncovered the number one complaint cheating husbands have about their home sex lives. Believe it or not, the majority say it’s frequency of sex. This is exactly what I hear in my practice. Women’s magazines make women believe that they have to have a PhD in prostitution education or else the husband’s going to cheat, according to Gary. Not true, It’s just a matter of frequency.<br>
This is important information ladies so pay attention. Sex for men is an emotional act, and a woman initiating sex is like getting flowers and him washing the dishes for us! It’s saying that I adore you, I care about you, I want to do something nice for you. It’s a way that they connect, Gary says. He wants to do it with you because he wants to feel love. He wants to have that loving connection—the touch, the feel, the sensuality, the passion that comes through a sexual connection.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I am seeing more and more clients, both men, women, and even children who are living with emotional abuse. Unfortunately, many do not have a name to put with the pain. They often believe they are the ones who cause the problem – certainly not the abuser. I have decided to bring this often unrecognized abuse into the open by first listing the signs and symptoms and then to follow up with a longer article.  If you feel your relationship may be verbally and emotionally abusive, talk to people you trust. Contact me for further information, talk to clergy, call your local battered women’s shelter, educate yourself, but seek professional help. Do not allow verbal and emotional abuse to escalate to battery!<br>

	•	try to convince you he or she is “right,” while you are “wrong?”<br>
	•	frequently say things that are later denied or accuse you of misunderstanding?<br>
	•	treat you like a sex object, or as though sex should be provided on demand regardless of how you feel?<br>
Your situation is critical if you:<br>
•	You express your opinions less and less freely</p>
<p>	•	You find yourself walking on eggshells, careful of when and how to say something.<br>
	•	You long for that softer, more vulnerable part of your partner to emerge.<br>

	•	You feel emotionally unsafe.<br>
	•	You feel its somehow not OK to talk with others about your relationship.<br>
	•	You hope things will change…especially through your love and understanding.<br>
	•	You find yourself doubting your memory or sense of reality.<br>
	•	You doubt your own judgment.<br>
	•	You doubt your abilities.<br>
	•	You feel vulnerable and insecure.<br>
	•	You are becoming increasingly depressed.<br>
	•	You feel increasingly trapped and powerless.<br>
	•	You have been or are afraid of your partner.<br>
	•	Your partner has physically hurt you, even once.  </p>
<p>Following are the signs and symptoms of emotional abuse:<br>
•	Feeling of depression<br>
•	Withdrawal from social interaction<br>
•	Isolation from friends and family<br>
•	Low self-esteem<br>
•	Fearfulness<br>
•	Increased anxiety<br>
•	Guilty feeling<br>
•	Feeling of shame<br>
•	Mood changes<br>
•	Nervous feeling<br>
•	Not trusting others<br>
•	Frequent blaming on others<br>
•	Self-blaming<br>
•	Pessimistic behavior<br>
•	Substance or drug abuse<br>
•	Extreme dependence on others<br>
•	Avoiding eye-contact<br>
•	Telling lies<br>
•	Aggressive behavior<br>
•	Emotional instability<br>
•	Suicidal attempts<br>
The ultimate outcome of emotional abuse is that the sufferer gets scared to be left alone. In majority of the cases, the recipients of emotional abuse believe that no one else likes or wants to be with them, except the abuser. Hence, they continue to stay in the abusive situations. The sufferer feels ashamed and keeps secret about the emotional abuse. In this way, the emotional abuse continues. </p>
<p>If the emotional abuse remains unchecked, it can worsen the symptoms and may lead to serious emotional and psychological disorders. In case, you are abused or if you notice that somebody is being abused, then you can consult and seek help from the support services like social service agency, police, legal adviser and health professional. The best way to prevent emotional abuse is personal awareness and understanding the rights and duties. </p>
<p>Though, some forms of emotional abuse like ignoring, insulting and isolating cannot be prosecuted, you can always consider reporting to your family and friends. Various laws have been enacted to punish emotional abusers. In some jurisdictions, failure to report child abuse cases are punished either by imprisonment or in the form of fine.</p>

					<p>This is my first Blog post since the launch of my new website. I am thrilled to have a vehicle in which I can communicate not only with clients and potential clients, but with people all over the world. Therefore, if you find anything of interest please feel free to share your comments or if you have any questions, ask away. I have many more articles thatI have written, but that are not yet posted here on the website, so if you have a specific request, I may just already have something I can share with you. I will be sending out a twitter message everytime I add new article so don’t forget to follow me on twitter, as well! Additionally, let me know what else you would like to see on the site – other resources, information, etc. I am anxious to make this a very user friendly site. Right now, one of my biggest concerns is the issue of emotional abuse. I will be posting an article about the signs of emotional abuse this afternoon, so please share your thoughts and feelings on this very important issue.</p>
