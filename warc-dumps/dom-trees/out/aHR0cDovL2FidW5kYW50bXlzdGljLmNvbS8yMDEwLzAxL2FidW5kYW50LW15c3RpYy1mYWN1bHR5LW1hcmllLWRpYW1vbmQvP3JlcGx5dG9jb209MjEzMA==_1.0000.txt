						<p>Thanks Marie this is the 2.nd time I hear you within a short time, and both times were very informative and inspiring. and last time I got my LOA number. I changed the direction I face when working at my desk so I face my success direction North, and WOW it makes a major change. I am SO much more effective and do not tire of working. that in itself is a great sign of success for me. time will show what more success shows up.</p>

						<p>Thank you, Marie.  I find so much abundance in the wealth of knowledge in each of your courses that I have taken.  The idea of valuing my healing work makes so much sense.  I just have to be better at implementing that concept.  Each day I try to be conscious of my thoughts and also the space I live in.  It is a work in progress.  But I can always come back to the CDs from your courses for encouragement and inspiration.  Thank you.</p>

						<p>Just after I finished listening to Marie’s interview, I had an amazing experience of divine timing and divine abundance. I wondered when the bubble fountain for prosperity that I recently ordered for Feng Shui would arrived. I checked the tracking number online and saw it had left the local UPS station this morning. So I thought, “Hmm, it might come today.” Suddenly, I heard the UPS truck coming down my street. Before I could get to the door, the driver had already knocked and was walking away, leaving the box with the bubble fountain inside! Needless to say, it is already up and running in the west part of my office, which is the direction Marie said to place it this year (in another class). Thank you again, Marie!</p>

						<p>My home temple is being upgraded because of Marie. I’m going to teach my children, my husband, and myself how to use these tools to create balance. We live in the Redwoods. My goal since we moved here is to bring nature inside in a harmonious way. Thanks for helping us be more grounded and respectful in the forest.</p>

						<p>Thanks Marie I understand more about giving myself more value. Very interesting and inspiring, I understand more about the abundance and how to make it flow more. I see more why the flow in my home was blocked. I am the advisor #7 LOA really fascinating. Thank you so much. Time for clearing and cleaning to attract more.</p>

						<p>Marie is just as fantastic during interviews as she was in “The Secret”.  Thank you for sharing your valuable information regarding how the level of tidiness and organization inside our homes effects our abundance,  that the physical location of the home also has an effect, and why bartering is an indication of poverty consciousness.</p>

						<p>Maria,<br>
   Thank-you so much for teaching me more about LOA # and FengShui.  I am so looking forward to going to your website.  I learned so much in this short interview that is going to be so very helpful–from personal, to business, to helping with the children!  It all flows when we flow.  Thank-you for your insight.  Ah–there is so much to learn, but this is great to be able to hear it from the teacher!  Thank-you ever so much!</p>

						<p>What a great overview of Abundance.  Marie, so much of what you said made perfect sense to me, but was a different way of looking at things.  I’m going out to pick up my Law of Attraction Number. Thank you for this super Abundant gift!</p>

						<p>Thanks for this program.  I really like how she explains historically how mystics were taken care of by the community based upon the spiritual gifts they bestowed.  It helps one to understand why spiritual people would not have an initial inclination to ask for payment.</p>

						<p>Marie, This discussion about abundance and prosperity conciousness provided some great reminders and focused-insight into some of the challenges we are currently experiencing.  Time to revisit my Diamond Feng Shui Manual and implement appropriate cures and activations.  I LOVED the simplicity with which you have involved your children and increased their awareness of how their environment affects how they function and feel.  Looking forward to involving my children in the process even more.  Thank you!</p>

						<p>Marie, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with us about abundance.  I especially liked your discussion of charitable giving and the example you gave of the author who gave his royalty check to the Red Cross, what an abundant and generous act!  I hope to have the same ability in the future…Thank you again!</p>

						<p>Bartering is an interesting concept in this day and age.  It shocked me that bartering is an expression of Poverty Consciousness–I never thought of it that way. I like the three month trail period until I get to the value that I place on what I have to offer to the world.  She offered some interesting techniques with Feng Shui and how it allows you to have a bit of chaos within the order. I can’t wait to try them in my home</p>

						<p>I am a true believer in Marie!  I discovered through her teachings that I was sleeping in my disease direction for 10 years.  My health challenges were getting greater and I was searching for help.  After taking her course I rearranged my bedroom and my health began to improve.  It sounds simple, but it worked!  Thanks Marie!!!</p>

						<p>Wonderful! I never realized that our environment could make such a difference I will get started on that asap. I found the bartering conversation also interesting. Unfortunately, I have been giving all my info away for free I guess I will need to correct my mind as well as my home.</p>

						<p>Thanks for an amazing interview and taking the time time to do this from “half way around the world”! It was extremely helpful – now I have inspiration to clear up the clutter, which is everywhere – no wonder getting by business going is such hard work. Thank you very much for offering a free e-book on the loa directions – I look forward to applying that to help me move forward into overflowing abundari … heeheehee … Also thank you, Ed, for asking such great questions and for producing this series … I can feel success wanting to bubble up – now I need to create the space – that was an aha moment …</p>

						<p>You are so right about valuing yourself and your service, but I also think that it does come down to what some people are able to pay.  It is almost about doing pro-bono work (using a legal phrase), but the people that you are healing still wish to “pay” something, because it gives them dignity, and dignity between healing and “client” is very important.  Therefore I say, that for those who can afford our services, let them pay to enable usyu to “help” others in a more charitable sense.</p>

						<p>I listened to Marie, and got a special message about poverty consciousness which has been keeping me in lack for years, I am now in the process of applying Marie’s ideas on valueing which makes perfect sense, it has never been explained so simply ie;going to the greengrocer to get fod. Now the most confussing part is how to put a value on yourself and /or your goods. Iam on my way to listen to her agian before it’s closed.<br>
Thank you.</p>

						<p>Thanks Ed for another great interview! I LOVE Marie’s practical use of ancient wisdom, as well her thoughts on barter which I have grappled with off &amp; on – in the beginning yes, and there’s a time to say no. And also, she reinforced my approach which has been to assess/intuit if someone is REALLY in need and they do have enough $$ or whether it is part of their scarcity story that I can choose not to plug into. Tomorrow we as a group are doing our vision boards – unknowingly I went to Marie’s website, and she has a full booklet which I’ve downloaded giving guidance for vision boards!</p>

						<p>Hi Marie,</p>
<p>many things you revealed caused that I’m feeling rounder, more identical with myself. To know my archetyp was very important and connected some essential dots. It has given my life a direction I was searching for a long time, my own direction. I think I now have found the compass I was looking for: I feel encouraged to live my entertainer! And this makes a big difference! The judgements are away, I understand, that’s my way to be inspired and to inspire!<br>
I’m a very creative person and I’m feeling much more in tune with my creativity – the last blockages have fallen away, I’m pretty shure!<br>
See a foto of my art work on my Blog.<br>
Unlike after other talks when I often feel a bid empty after the excitement about the insights has faded away,- after your talk I feel that I have grown and that I’m myself, in myself. I also don’t feel that I have to apply a method you’re teaching, I’m simply inspired and enhanced of myself.<br>
No excitement, awareness instead, yes.<br>
A method to me always is something artifical. Well, your teaching has methods as well. But obviously you’re not in resonance with the system, but you are essential.</p>
<p>With the information in the pdf I’ll work, I mean I’ll create… .</p>
<p>Love,<br>

						<p>Marie said: “Money is part of the spiritual experience, of the divine expression of what I am giving to the world.” I really resonate to the idea of giving yourself a value in order to be overflowing. Thank you for a great interview and great teachings on Feng Shui.</p>

						<p>I have always been willing to help anyone, without expecting anything back until I had an epiphany that the recipients determined the value to them was what they invested into it.  Therefore, my time, work and knowledge was worth nothing to them because they invested nothing into it.  When I started charging more, they valued my knowledge, work and opinions much more.  This lesson shows this is true.<br>

						<p>Very informative and very powerful. A clean and orderly house creates more room for abundance.  That is so true.  I always feel better and happier when the house is clean and orderly.  Thank you Marie for sharing such valuable information.</p>

						<p>Thank you Marie for once again offering great insight.  This idea of bartering is one that many more new-age people have and I am so glad that you have addressed it in a way that maybe more people will be able to understand and accept.  Also, I do believe its really time for everyone to step up to the plate and use all of the tools available to them (such as your feng shui) to be all that they can be.  </p>
<p>Thank you once again.</p>

						<p>Community Provisions- Great concept – What if this happened again?  Until then claim and state your value.<br>
It was well stated and helped me to own my responsibility in the matter.  I mean I really enjoy art and purchase it at the value stated by the artist with pleasure.   Each conversation is remarkable!!!</p>

						<p>This is definitely so cool.  I have had people come to my house to do some direction in Feng Shui, but I never really understood it.  Now I want to learn so much more.  I’m open to the abundance of life and this is so broadening and uplifting.  Thank you so much for this opportunity.  I found that my number is 6, and Archtype is Inventor, and I’m excited to know what this means.</p>

						<p>What an amazing experience hearing Marie’s sharing of abundance wisdom! The last week of listening to the abundance series has shifted an important element in my understanding of abundance. Within 5 minutes of moving the trash from my relationship area of my room brought resolution within an hour of two issues that had been dragging on for more than a year! Wow. I look forward to helping my 12 year old to try order on his room <img src="http://abundantmystic.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>This was such an empowering interview. Self esteem is something many have struggled with. Having tools to move past the past beliefs and how to recognize and reinterpret them is a gift. Thank you Dr. Joe for your personal story and the tools you have shared.<br>
-- Kim</p>
<p>This was my kind of interview! I felt like I was eavesdropping on a totally interesting conversation between two people I’d like to know. One sentence that really stood out for me was when Vicki said the words, “Peace in the midst of abundance.” Thank you for the advice – now I am all about ‘digging’ into my first chakra (and loving trees even more).<br>
-- Jessica</p>
<p>I have always believed I live a spirited life but not to the 1000% to be rewarded with abundence. Call it peer pressure, or lack of confidence. This reading has helped me let go of my ‘ego’ to feel life’s full pleasures! Thank you, I truely appreciated the wonderful insight and am grateful for being a part of this learning.<br>
--Maria</p>
<p>Thank you for reminding me of who I AM!!! This path is always about remembering. Because of this interview I will continue my creative path as an artist without being so concerned with the outcome .<br>
--Samora</p>
<p>I love this process you share with us, Ed, of your deepening into the moment with these wonderful, wise and shining individuals, and together finding glowing abundant veins of gold — and then sharing them with us with an open hand. You are modeling the abundance of overflowing. Thank you Ed, thank you Marie for your wonderful insights and sharings, thank you to all the abundant mystics giving interviews and listening to interviews. I love feeling we are all growing and blessing the world together.<br>
--Karen</p>
<p>OMG–I just learned SO MUCH. So many great ideas and reality checks that I would have to list almost everything in the interview! Thank you for sharing. I am grateful.<br>
--Evelyn</p>
<p>Thankyou for all the gems of clarity you shared in this interview. Such great examples and reminders that humour, creativity, trust, faith, love and gratitude are the authentic, organic ingredients in living a life of abundance.<br>
Such a gift to hear your voice share these insights.<br>
--Jan</p>
<p>You have a lovely take on laughter. Thank you for your reminding us to be in the moment. Your conversation was so alive, especially when you laughed. I also liked your confirmation of being grateful for our life spirit and for the GIFT of being simple.Thank you.<br>
--mordechai</p>
<p>A powerfully uplifting interview. Many helpful ideas. At 76 I am going through a lesson in learning to rely on Spirit and my creativity to meet my needs. You put together all the loose ends I have been picking up from many sources. Many thanks.<br>
--Elizabeth</p>
<p>I had posted yesterday after listening to this. I just finished listening to this again today. I believe everyone shoud listen to this over and over again as you get more out if it each time.<br>
--Melissa</p>
<p>Thank you so much Bari And Ed!<br>
Another wonderful interview with lots of gems. I loved how you shared the story of your journey and your aha moments along the way. I had a few of them myself listening to you.<br>
--Kucki</p>
<p>This has been a remarkably helpful one for me. I am a physician and have been feeling like my work isn’t the way I want it to be for a while now, my self esteem was smashed a couple of years ago by a heart break, and its been hard to get back on the horse and fine my new way. This whole series has been so inspiring but this one in particular, has helped me a lot. Thank you so much.<br>
--Shiroko</p>
<p>Wow! What a packed interview! Such great tools and steps to break attachments and reframe our thoughts and step into action. I will be looking over this material and digesting it for a while! Thank you so much!<br>
--Kathy</p>
<p>Thank you SO MUCH for the tools already shared during the interview. And then you give a bonus gift. Wow!<br>
And Ed, congrats on being a great father as well as a great interviewer. Putting this together was a brilliant idea and a great gift to us.<br>
--C.J.</p>
<p>This interview blew me away! I learned SO much! His systems &amp; tools for reinventing oneself and “recognize, release, recreate and manifest tip I found to be so valuable.<br>
There ARE no coincidences…I was MEANT to hear this interview! Thank you Ed!<br>
--Dee</p>
<p>I’m so glad that self esteem was included in this series! It is at the root of all our self limiting beliefs. I like seeing how what Joe shared reinforced and clearly elaborated on so many of the viewpoints of the previous sessions. I have lots of notes to go back and think about. Glad for the personal stories you shared Joe, as they opened me to taking it all in.<br>
--Jill</p>
<p>I loved this interview! I got so much out of it! I am going to listen to it, at least one more time, to absorb more of the valuable information in it. I valued your definition of “abundance” – “living a life of no regret, where you are maximally fulfilled, … When all of those different elements come together, then you are living abundantly. I am going to check-out your web-sites. Thank you for sharing your experiences and wisdom with us.<br>
--Athena</p>
<p>Great call today on working from the heart in service to others. I particularly appreciate the “worthy” concept. I’ve always approached my business from a service mindset, but to promote myself was more difficult. Reminding myself of the extended implications of feeling worthy with help a great deal. Thanks.<br>
--Kathy</p>
<p>Excellent call! *move past the “no’s”; don’t let them scare you *the power of focus, realizing what you want and then GOING for it…. not just sitting around meditating on what you like *being of SERVICE to others…. *service is the door to respect and high places<br>
--Mr Black</p>
<p>Thank you Debbie for wonderful advice. Feeling worthy and connecting your head and heart!! But most of all being of service to others connects us in a way that inspires us to become the people we were meant to be! To be and do the Highest Good. Good work!!<br>
--Catherine</p>
<p>So many different perspectives. I love the reminders from Debbie – things don’t show up as you may have preferred, but they do show up, find your worth, ASK, make genuine connections and be of service to others. I also like her practical vibe.<br>
--Michelle</p>
<p>Straight forward great interview starting with her definition of Abundance being all of one’s life’s desires flowing easily. I also loved her useful tools ie visualize, affirm, be clear and focused and know the big Why behind it. You also made a great point that she doesn’t just Ask! She Asks then looks and actively seeks opportunities to have her goal fulfilled.<br>
--Pam</p>
<p>That is a whole lot of new information for me to digest!! I did no know much about chakras …I have an interest now. I have always had a love and need for nature…have always needed to put my hands in the earth…never knew why that was …I think I am starting to understand. Thank You!<br>
--Claudette</p>
<p>This was my kind of interview! I felt like I was eavesdropping on a totally interesting conversation between two people I’d like to know. One sentence that really stood out for me was when Vicki said the words, “Peace in the midst of abundance.”<br>
Thank you for the advice – now I am all about ‘digging’ into my first chakra (and loving trees even more).<br>
--Jessica</p>
<p>I love the concept of connection between impact and earnings. I am living that right now, watching as my commitment to making a difference in people’s lives grows, the doorways to all kinds of abundance are opening! Thank you for sharing!<br>
--Layne</p>
<p>Thank you! I’ve listened to your interview twice and have really gained a lot of insight into my own situation and choices. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And now on to action!<br>
--Liz</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this interview. Great insight &amp; too many aha moments to list. Thanks!!<br>
--Megan</p>
<p>Today’s program was an angel send. I recently had to do something that was distasteful and I felt very guilty about. Through your message today, I am relieved of the guilt. I realized I was only taking care of me. THANK YOU THANK YOU.<br>
I look forward to each session.<br>
--Joy</p>
<p>I love this series. I look forward to it as part of my day. Suzanne’s talk has me looking at my money struggles in relation to my unwillingness to impact people on a higher level, as well as self-care, and my business being like my body.<br>
--Ute</p>
<p>Thank you for your inspiring story about charging what you’re worth. Also, I had not heard about the connection between body metabolism and business metabolism, but it totally makes sense and is something that needs to be a priority for me. I connected and resonated with many of the points you made, so will check out your website and blog. Thank you Ed for your insightful and helpful questions and for doing this series.<br>
--Marja</p>
<p>What a humbling experience to hear Sonia’s voice and experiences.It did uplift my spirit today… and made it simple to  access new aboudance,Thank you!<br>
--Suzanne</p>
<p>I so enjoyed Sonia’s interview as I enjoy whenever I hear her soothing and empowering words! Great job with Abundant Mystics! Wonderful place to connect and enjoy the abundant universe! I loved when Sonia said give your gifts, whatever they are at the moment and all will follow in good measure. We are so blessed and the world is waiting for our gifts. Thank you again for a fantastic treasure in Abundant Mystics! You rock!<br>
--Carole</p>
<p>I feel so validated and alive after listening. What a great gift! My heart is overflowing with gratitude.<br>
