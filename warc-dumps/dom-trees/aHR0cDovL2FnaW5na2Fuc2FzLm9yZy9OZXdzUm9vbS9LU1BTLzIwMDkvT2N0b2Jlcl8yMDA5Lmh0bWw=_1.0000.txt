    <h3>Humor: <strong>Age in place? We  still need special accommodations</strong></h3>
    <p>By Ardythe Kolb</p>
    <p>Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>The “age-in-place”  concept is understandably very popular these days. We don’t dread those  fabulous golden years quite as much if we’re able to face them in familiar  surroundings.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My husband and I decided  a couple of years ago to escape from lawn mowers, squirrels and all the other  enjoyable aspects of a large, tree-covered lot. We figured we’d move before the  kids began to hint, “Have you thought about a retirement community?” while  pounding a “For Sale” sign in our front yard.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We found a maintenance-provided  home we love, and we can still putter with some flowers, so we’re not missing  out on anything. The house can easily be adapted with safety features if we  need more help some day. It has wide doors that could accommodate a wheelchair,  and all the essential rooms are on one level in the event that stairs become a  problem. <br>
    </p>
    <p>So, we’re all set — except for one  major problem: How to deal with all those easy-open containers as our muscles  lose a little vigor.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I learned to operate a can opener  when I was about 5 years old and mastered the tool quite adequately through the  years. But those old, unimproved cans that use a simple can opener are fast  disappearing. <br>
    </p>
    <p>My first adventure with an “easy-open  can” came several years ago, before I retired. At noon, I took a little  container of ravioli from my lunch box, pried up the pull-tab, and struggled in  vain to get the thing to cooperate. I put on my bifocals to read the  instructions: “Lift tab to rim. Pull back slowly.” I tugged, yanked, and cut  two fingers. After I found a couple of bandages in the back of a drawer, I once  again tackled the obstinate contraption. Then the pull-tab broke off entirely, providing  a cute little ring on my index finger. So I resorted to a pair of pliers and a  screwdriver from the office toolbox. Finally the lid popped off — and tomato  sauce splattered all over my shirt, pants, and papers on the desktop. By the  time I sopped up the mess, my lunch break was nearly over, soggy paper towels  lay in the trash, and my beige clothes definitely told a story. Besides that,  the few little pasta pillows (without sauce) were barely enough to whet my  appetite. I surely expended more caloric energy than I consumed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I can’t offer any tips about how to  accomplish the opening process with finesse, but I learned one valuable lesson:  Always wear something that matches the food you hope to eat. Orange floral  prints blend with almost anything.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For some mysterious reason, known  only to corporate executives who <em>never</em> prepare their own food, the number of “easy-open” cans on grocery store shelves  keeps increasing. Soup, which spills even more readily than ravioli, is one of  the main culprits.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>“Easy-open” is in the same category  with “child-proof.” Toilet cleaner comes in almost-impossible-to-open  containers. These used to be simple, yet safe from young explorers who might  get hurt. Now every new bottle is a fresh challenge. I struggled to open a  bottle of toilet cleaner to no avail one day, and finally asked my husband for  help. He had no more success than I, though he is much stronger. Eventually he  took it to the garage. I heard a series of inarticulate sounds and the clang of  tools. Before long, he emerged triumphantly with a broad grin and an open  bottle that would never close again. That’s OK. I put it on a shelf where no  one under five feet could reach it. I never asked exactly what happened in the  garage, but a telltale puddle remained under the vise and a heavy hammer sat on  his workbench. The whole process took the better part of an hour, but at least  it gave us something to grumble about.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some medicine bottles are getting  easier, but many are still horrific. Nothing is more disheartening, when you  have a major headache, than a battle with an ibuprofen bottle. I realize that  it’s important to keep children safe, but there again, most kids have no  problem getting lids off. I, on the other hand, push down and twist — but nothing  happens. Using my teeth to pry the cap off only makes my mouth hurt. Banging  the bottle on the counter doesn’t do the job, but may ease a little  frustration. By the time it finally opens, I need an extra tablet or two.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Should I even mention the insidious  molded plastic that encases all sorts of products, ranging from toothbrushes to  tools to toys for our grandchildren? The idea, I suppose, is to pry or peel the  plastic off without breaking the item it’s designed to protect. That usually  doesn’t work, nor can the plastic be cut with normal scissors. A knife is a  dangerous option that’s liable to do more harm than good. We might try an  acetylene torch, but probably ought to notify the fire department and hospital  first.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>One possible answer to these  packaging problems is to ask a young, athletic-looking person at the store to  open everything before you even take it home. (Well, maybe that’s not such a  good idea.) Perhaps neighborhood kids or grandchildren could be called in to  help. How else can we successfully cope with such a dilemma while we  age-in-place with poise and aplomb?</p>

    <h3>The appliance conspiracy</h3>
    <p>By DeMar Regier<br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>Have you ever noticed how appliances, light bulbs, plumbing, and other  household equipment goes wrong at the same time? It’s as if they have an  uncanny communication line that alerts them to act together. I even think “they  “ have a mantra: “Never, ever, let one thing happen at a time.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>The reason I am so sure of this goes years back, to a three-week vacation  in Europe. Upon arriving home, we found that the coffee maker, water heater,  and washing machine had all quit working! Since each was operating perfectly  when we left, how could <em>three </em>go bad at the same time? Either they  sulked at being left alone or, more believable, they gleefully enjoyed the  agony of having to be replaced after a budget depleted by vacation!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even so, nothing prepared me for the activity after my husband died. The  first night I spent alone — weary, sad, and hardly thinking — I drove toward the  garage and pressed the remote button to open it. Nothing happened. Five tries  later, slowly, sluggishly, and, I thought, peevishly, the door opened. Immediately, even in my  numbness, I had an eerie feeling. Could this be a warning?<br>
    </p>
    <p>And I was right. Later, as I walked down the  hall toward my bedroom, the high ceiling light blinked twice and went out. My only  choice was to find a stepstool (too short), then go to the garage and lug in a  ladder. As I perched on its fifth rung, my hand groping upward in the dark,  teetering precariously, I somehow found the burned-out bulb. Miraculously, the  new one worked, and I thankfully went on to the bedroom and switched on the  light. It flickered teasingly. Stunned, I tried again. It lit — and promptly went  out!<br>
    </p>
    <p>No one can ever convince me the two hadn’t  schemed. And the madness didn’t stop. In time, the dishwasher ran over, the  disposal clogged, and the lock fell off the patio door. Compared to lights and  spillovers, <em>locks</em> told me how  aggressive this collaboration could be. I knew I must act quickly! And so I  have done these three things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminated  long vacations (appliance boredom might be the problem).</li>
      <li>Have  available an ever-ready, hunky looking handyman.</li>
      <li>Bluffed.  A lot. I have taped warranties near the dishwasher and clothes washer and  dryer, stocked batteries in the refrigerator, placed a plunger near the  disposal, and hung heavy-duty gloves in the bathroom and kitchen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Is it working? Time will tell. But at least  I’m showing the appliances that <em>I mean  business.</em></p>

    <h3>Elder law: Divorce for older couples</h3>
    <p><em>By Alexandra R. English </em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is often said that a divorce is  the most stressful event in anyone’s life. This is particularly the case if you  have been with the same partner for decades and are afraid to be alone for the  first time. If a marriage has reached its breaking point, however, divorce can  become just as necessary for senior adults as it is for younger couples. I  hope, in this article, to ease your fears and provide some confidence about  moving on with your life.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each state’s divorce laws are  different. Kansas law requires that you reside in Kansas for 60 days before  filing a divorce. If you have children under 18, the state can make an initial  custody decision for children who have lived in Kansas for six consecutive  months.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The “petitioner” is the spouse who  files the divorce, and the “respondent” is the spouse against whom the divorce  is filed. Once the divorce is filed, the papers must be “served” on the  respondent spouse. That can occur in person, by certified mail, or by publication.  The respondent has 20 days (30 days if served out of state) to answer the  lawsuit for divorce. Kansas law requires that the divorce action be on file for  a minimum of 60 days before it is finalized.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When the petitioner initially files,  the court may issue temporary orders to resolve some concerns. Standard  temporary orders include a mutual restraining order so neither party can harass  the other and orders granting possession of personal and real property,  prohibiting parties from disposing of property, prohibiting parties from  canceling utilities or closing bank accounts, and even requiring maintenance. If  the couple has minor children, temporary orders may include an order for child  support, child custody, and a temporary visitation schedule.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If the 60 days pass and there is no  response, the matter may be finalized “by default.” This means that the court  hears from only one party, the petitioner, and usually that party receives  everything requested, if Kansas has jurisdiction to grant it. In a divorce, the  court may end the marriage, divide property (including retirement accounts) and  debts, order spousal maintenance (otherwise known as alimony), determine child  custody arrangements, order child support, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If the respondent answers the divorce  suit, efforts will be made to resolve issues between the parties. If the issues  cannot be resolved, a trial may occur — and then it takes much longer than 60  days to finalize the divorce.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some couples avoid divorce solely for  financial reasons. However, provisions are in place to support a spouse with  fewer resources. In most cases, one spouse cannot receive maintenance from the  other spouse unless they have been married at least five years. Other factors  the court looks at to determine whether maintenance is appropriate include the  age of the couple, their current and prospective earning capacities, property  owned, the length of the marriage, the parties’ needs and overall financial  situation, and the contribution or sacrifice by one party to aid another’s  education or career. The longer the couple was married, the longer a spouse is  entitled to maintenance. Maintenance is based on a formula, and it is best for  an attorney or judge to make the calculations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Spouses who never worked may fear that  if they obtain a divorce they will no longer receive Social Security income.  This is not true. If your marriage lasted at least 10 years, you are able to  receive benefits based on your ex-spouse’s record, even if he or she remarried.  To qualify, however, you must be unmarried and 62 or older. The benefit you are  entitled to receive based on your own work must be less than the benefit you  would receive based on your ex-spouse’s work. Finally, your ex-spouse must be  entitled to his or her Social Security retirement or disability benefits.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You may <em>not</em> remarry and still collect benefits from your former spouse’s  Social Security record unless your later marriage ends by death, divorce, or  annulment. This may account for a growing trend among elder couples to live  together rather than marry. For additional information on this subject, visit www.socialsecurity.gov/gethelp1.htm.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some couples may wonder about the  difference between a legal separation (also known as a “separate maintenance  action”) and a divorce. In a divorce, the court actually <em>terminates</em> the marriage. In a legal separation, the court divides  the parties’ property and debts without terminating the marriage. For those who  do not wish to terminate their marriage for ethical or religious reasons, but  who do wish to come to a formalized agreement dividing assets and finances, a  legal separation may be a viable option.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some people think that if they obtain  a legal separation, they will keep the same health care plan as their spouse.  In reality, that depends on how the insurance company defines a “qualifying  event.” If a legal separation is defined as a qualifying event, then one party may  be removed from the spouse’s health care plan after the separation. Be sure to  check with your insurance company before you decide to obtain a legal separation  rather than a divorce.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is possible to file a divorce “pro  se,” or without representation of an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney  or if you believe that you and your spouse can reach an agreement quickly. Pro  se divorce forms developed by the Kansas Judicial Council are available at www.kansasjudicialcouncil.org/DivorceForms.shtml.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is always best to have an attorney  represent you in a divorce. To find an attorney, call the Kansas Bar  Association’s Lawyer Referral Service, 800-928-3111. You might not ever know  your rights unless you do.</p>

    <h3>Home front: The other rolling stones</h3>
    <p>By Don Carter<br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>Granted, this  report is only relevant to a small percent of<span style="font-style: italic"> </span>readers: those who have pre-1960s mortared limestone  basement walls. That said, we are seeing enough problems with these walls to  realize that knowledge of a potential risk should benefit those who <em>do</em> have them.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I like the old  limestone walls because they are more robust than concrete and by any measure a  better wall than masonry block. Cost, not performance, is the obvious reason  they fell out of favor.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Typically 18 to  22 inches thick, these walls have so much mass that trees, water, and earth will  not overwhelm them — at least not to the extent that they do the lesser walls. But,  while the limestone itself seems immune to deleterious effects from ground  water, this is not true for all <em>mortars.</em> We see about half a dozen houses a year where mortar that bonds the stones  together has been reduced to sand and a screwdriver easily penetrates right into  the joint.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This means the  stones are no longer connected and stability is reduced to that of a gravity  wall — stones dry-stacked one upon another. In most cases, the wall still  functions from its own dead weight, but it is no longer the wall it was  intended to be. And sand is symptomatic of a greater problem.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What happened to  the mortar? Chemistry is what happened. Things in nature try to achieve something  known as “pH balance.” Acids have pH values under 7, alkalis above 7, and  balance near 7.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Rain is essentially  distilled water that forms from evaporation and condensation. Because it is soft,  previous generations often collected rain water for laundry and hair washing. But  with no appreciable minerals in it, rain water is out of pH balance so it sucks  lime out of the mortar to correct its imbalance. This takes a long time and  happens primarily in locations with faulty water control, such as improperly  tapered grade or poorly functioning gutters and downspouts.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>If you have  limestone walls, use a screwdriver or ice pick to stab a few mortar joints randomly  in each face. If the probe penetrates a joint by more than a fraction of an inch,  you are likely going to find sand.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Repairs are  fairly straightforward, reasonably priced, and often optional. I won’t try to  define the solution here. But if you see sand, send us an e-mail and I will share  repair information along with some names of people who can do the work.</p>

    <h3>Lynne Smith: Let's talk leisure</h3>
    <p>By Lynne Smith<br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Dear Lynne,</strong><br>
      My wife and I are both retired, very  social, and neither of us has had any difficulty using our leisure time — until  now. We enjoy spending the majority of our time together. As we plan our days,  we have noticed an increasing “been there, done that” feeling in response to  our own brainstorming efforts. Can you help us find a list of entertainment options  for seniors? And please don’t tell me to read a good book.<br>
  <em>Sincerely,</em><br>
  <em>Been there, done that</em></p>
    <p><strong>Dear Been there,</strong><br>
      Wow! You sound  like a no-nonsense kind of guy. I can absolutely send a list of leisure and recreational  interests to you. (I must, however, include the disclaimer that no list will likely  bring the satisfaction it appears that you are seeking.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Entertainment is basically “diversionary” in nature. While  it has a clear role in a well-rounded leisure lifestyle, entertainment as a  main staple will almost definitely leave you malnourished.<br>
      However, some diversionary activities meet needs such as  bringing peace of mind and serenity. In this instance, the person being  entertained in a sense becomes a “participant” and the involvement has strong  merit. I am sure this will come up in a future question and we can discuss it  further.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Remember that the  creation of a fulfilling personal leisure lifestyle is going to take some <em>effort.</em> Once that is part of your  expectation, the process immediately becomes easier. It becomes a process of  discovery and even adventure. This could mean starting from scratch or just  changing elements of your leisure that you have identified as lacking.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When most, if  not all, of your time is discretionary, planning how you use your time is more  involved than skimming a list of plays, restaurants, and events. I would  challenge you to begin collecting all the information you can.Newspapers are chuck full of ideas to  explore, but don’t stop there. Go to a bookstore or library and ask for  assistance in finding book titles dealing with retirement. Check out the  catalog at your local community center, or have a computer-savvy grandchild help  you with an Internet search if you are unfamiliar with the Web.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I hope you take  the challenge. I assure you that you can reduce, if not eliminate, those “been  there, done that” feelings.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It was great  hearing from you. Keep reading!<br>
        <em>Lynne</em></p>

    <h3>Mr. Biddle's midnight wqrning</h3>
    <p>By Richard W. Jennings<br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle did not always have three little dogs. Like most  people, he started out with just one. But then, one day and one night, a  strange thing happened.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Although cold outside at the time, it was a lovely morning  at Mr. Biddle’s townhouse. The sun was shining brightly through the living room  windows. Mr. Biddle was relaxing on his battered leather couch, reading a book  about Tuscany. And Mr. Biddle’s sole companion, his little bow-legged dog, lay  upside-down on the carpet, amusing himself with a hard, round hambone from last  night’s dinner.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, if you were to view a photograph of this scene, you  would say to yourself: <em>Here, truly, is a  contented household.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>Alas, the cliché is true: Appearances can be deceiving.  Your observation would have failed to take into account the contents of Mr.  Biddle’s recent dream. Not two hours before this idyllic picture assembled  itself, Mr. Biddle had received some troubling news from the Angel of Death.<br>
    </p>
    <p>“We’re moving you up on the list,” the Angel of Death  announced. “Just thought you’d want to know.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now, Mr. Biddle was a level-headed man. He did not put much  stock in dream analysis, and if he had a nightmare in which he found himself  being cast into space or falling to his death from a tall building or being  eaten alive by alligators, he generally dismissed these images as the random  sloshing about of brain fluid in an overtired mind.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even on those rare occasions when Mr. Biddle found himself  comforted by the beautiful and sweet-smelling Aphrodite herself, by the time  the sun came up, he merely smiled at the recollection and went on about his  daily routine.<br>
    </p>
    <p>But the Angel of Death is not so easily dismissed, especially  when he has come with specific information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle found it hard to concentrate on the page. While  he was interested in whether the woman in Tuscany would be able to clear the  blackberries away from the cistern, and whether the Polish workers would ever  complete the tumbledown wall, he was troubled by the news of his position on  the list. Indeed, until last night he hadn’t even known there was a list.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course, Mr. Biddle was nobody’s fool. He knew that the  Angel of Death lurked in every shadow, that its cold hand held no compassion  for any living thing of any age, and that it was especially interested in  people like Mr. Biddle, men of advanced age in an obvious state of general  deterioration, men who did not take their medicines.<br>
    </p>
    <p><em>But still,</em> he thought. Mr. Biddle preferred to focus on day-to-day  living. <em>Perhaps,</em> thought Mr. Biddle,  hoping to cheer himself up, <em>it is a very  long list.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>One of the primary differences between Mr. Biddle and his  little bow-legged dog is that Mr. Biddle worried about things, whereas, so far  as Mr. Biddle could tell, his little bow-legged dog merely shrugged things off.  Certainly, his little bow-legged dog bore no grudges, nor did he appear to be  concerned about the possibility that one day Mr. Biddle would run out of food  or fail to provide a place for them when the winter storms raged. And never had  Mr. Biddle’s little bow-legged dog given an indication that he contemplated  Life After Mr. Biddle. <em>What is today is  what will always be,</em> Mr. Biddle presumed his little bow-legged dog  believed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle wondered if perhaps the nocturnal visit from the  Angel of Death carried with it the implication that he should be doing  something differently. But what? he wondered.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle was no miser, like Ebenezer Scrooge or King  Midas or whomever else might come to mind. He didn’t mistreat his servants or  employees. (Indeed, he had none.) He didn’t lie, or cheat, or steal, or plot  revenge. He harbored no ill will in his heart, or, at least, nothing serious.  The neighbor who consistently parked his construction truck in front of Mr. Biddle’s  house annoyed him, but that was like an itch. He could live with that.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle concluded that even if the Angel of Death were  knocking at his door, there was nothing of any significance in his life that he  should change. And so he returned to his reading.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle’s little bow-legged dog hopped up beside him and  scrunched around until Mr. Biddle idly scratched his companion’s silky ears  with one hand while turning pages with the other. Occasionally, Mr. Biddle  would pause in his reading and consider what method the Angel of Death might  have in mind. Would it be something highly personal, such as a heart attack, or  would it be an anonymous part in a widespread catastrophe, such as an asteroid  striking the Midwestern United States?<br>
    </p>
    <p>He hoped it would not be one of those things that now and  then were reported in the newspaper for the amusement of its more jaded  readers, such as a truckload of anchovy paste overturning on the highway, an  attack by a killer rabbit, a one-vehicle accident involving a street sweeper,  or the explosion of an occupied portable toilet at the county fair.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle’s mind drifted to the practical aspects of  dying. Should he review his will? Make a list of items he wished to give away?  Leave instructions for how he wished to be “sent off,” so to speak?<br>
    </p>
    <p>“If these really are my last moments on earth,” Mr. Biddle  said out loud, “I surely don’t want to spend them doing paperwork.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle recalled that his mother, knowing that her time  was drawing near, spent her last days cleaning her house from top to bottom,  presumably so visitors calling on the grief-stricken family would not consider  her to be a poor housekeeper. <em>Well,</em> he thought, noticing the laundry piled up in the kitchen and the dust bunnies  underneath the hall table, <em>I guess it  wouldn’t hurt to tidy up.</em> But did he really want to take his last breath  doing housework?<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle assumed that it was too late to be remembered  for some great achievement: Climbing the highest mountain. Discovering a cure  for a deadly disease. Winning an international prize. Being elected to high  office. Becoming a celebrated entertainer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle wasn’t frightened by the news from the Angel of  Death. He knew that such a thing was bound to happen someday. But he was  discouraged. In all these years, what had he accomplished?<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle’s little bow-legged dog lay on his back as Mr.  Biddle rubbed the creature’s fat, furry tummy and stroked his long, rabbit-like  feet. Outside, the sun was going down and the wind was rising. A long, cold  night lay ahead.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Biddle slipped a postcard between the pages of his book  about Tuscany and stepped into his kitchen, where he switched on a cooking show  on the countertop TV and set his oven to precisely 350 degrees. Tonight, he  decided, he would make chicken kabobs with chunks of fresh pineapple. His  little bow-legged dog loved baked chicken and Mr. Biddle loved his little bow-legged  dog.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Was this enough? Mr. Biddle wondered. Or would the Angel of  Death see fit to give him a little more time?<br>
    </p>
    <p>The next morning, after breakfast from matching bowls and a  leisurely walk around the pond, Mr. Biddle and his little bow-legged dog got  into Mr. Biddle’s rusty blue car and drove to the pet store. After a thorough  examination of the entire inventory, Mr. Biddle bought two more little brown  dogs — twins.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It’s never too late, Mr. Biddle concluded, to love a little  more.</p>

    <h3>Disappearing loved one</h3>
    <p><em>By Barbara Mayer</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>She had a light inside her<br>
      that never went out. She <br>
      glowed 500 watts all day long,<br>
      delighting all who shared her<br>
      path, softening others’ ills,<br>
      lifting their drooping  spirits,<br>
      until the shadows fell and <br>
      put out her lights one by  one.<br>
      I tried to find the switch  but<br>
      the vacant look, the clouded <br>
      eyes, remained unillumined.</p>
    <p>I read books to her, brought <br>
      her flowers, talked of  earlier<br>
      days when we were young,<br>
      but blankness was my return.<br>
      She was too young for this<br>
      numbness, this emptiness.<br>
      Still she sat staring out<br>
      the window at the snowy <br>
      hills where we once skied <br>
      and laughed only yesterday. </p>

    <h3>Ponderings from the porch</h3>
    <p>By Donna Leyda<br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>My thinking seems to have changed about the time we added the screened porch  on the back of the house.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Tasks were put on hold with not so much as a guilty twinge, the phone was  locked in the house, and no technology was allowed in this sacred, screened-in,  tree-surrounded sanctuary. My husband and I would sit quietly, not needing to  talk or intrude on each other’s mental ramblings but knowing that we both loved  this special spot.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Times change. The only creature of enough importance now to be let into this  special place at these times of reverie is a precious four-legged friend named  Darla Dog.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My rambling thoughts have changed, too. I don’t mentally plan what to get  for supper, where we will go on our next trip, or what movie we might like to  see. Now my special porch times provoke a slightly different mental journey: contemplation!  One of my special joys is sitting on the porch in the early morning or early  evening and wondering:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Why can’t those humming birds both drink at the same time instead of  fighting with each other? Why do nuthatches travel upside down on the trunk of  the tree?&nbsp;That bat who lives in the shutters across the street and flies  into our yard in the evening — is it too full to eat <em>our</em> hoards of tasty mosquitoes?&nbsp;How can Darla tell which barks  to return and which not to? Can I continue putting root stimulator on the  garden until frost or later?&nbsp;(That one I can look up.)&nbsp;Can Darla actually  hear chipmunks squeak?&nbsp;(She will get up from her curled position, put her  head on my knee, and with a little whine run to the porch door, frantically  bursting out to stick her nose under a board at the bottom of the porch where  those little critters hide.) Where is the wonderful flicker that comes to the  feeders in the winter and occasionally in summer?&nbsp;Isn’t it remarkable that  the little “crab Rangoon”-type buds of next year’s dogwood blossoms are already  there, along with the red seed pods from this year?&nbsp;Are there really 57  dimensions, as I heard on “Coast to Coast Live” last night?<br>
    </p>
    <p>These very simple and time-consuming ponderings relax me, because none of  them require a correct answer or any action at all. Along with the cicadas  buzzing their fall song, they are most pleasant.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I hate to see winter take away this special outdoor contemplation time. I  love the porch!</p>

    <h3>Humor: <span style="font-weight: bold">A</span><strong>s we age, we learn  to ask: What’s the hurry?</strong></h3>
    <p> By Mary Warner<br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <p>There is a saying that you know  you’re over the hill when you stop to think and forget to start again. Lately I  seem to be stopping more and starting less.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When did they put the world on fast-forward?  The planet is spinning on its axis at the same speed it did when I was a  youngster. It didn’t seem too fast then. Since the laws of the universe haven’t  changed, I must presume I have. Perhaps it isn’t that the pace has picked up,  it’s that mine has pooped out.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I am acutely aware that “fast” is  in vogue, but it wasn’t always so. Youths are notorious for taking on life with  frenzy. That is as it should be. While they scramble for the summit, I pick my  way among the rocks on the leeward side. I don’t say that with dismay. I  enjoyed the race to the top as much as anyone, but surprisingly, I have found that  most of my peak experiences occurred once I could see over the top.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Fast used to have some negative  connotations. “Fast” boys or girls were known for their debauchery and  questionable character. Now fast times are applauded. So we peal out at warp  speed, skidding by some of life’s best moments. Well, I, for one, am putting on  the brakes. If age does anything for us, it reminds us that on some of our fast  starts we’re going to experience ignition trouble.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I’ve experienced very few things  that were better done faster. Exceptions would be childbirth and root canals. I  could rest my case with fast food alone. When our children were younger, our  family would order and devour this speedy repast in the time it would take to  find a parking spot at a classy eatery. The entire dinner conversation could  amount to “Dad, do you want my pickles?”<br>
    </p>
    <p>Our European neighbors know the  value of a several-course meal to be savored with family and friends — but they are  probably eating real food. I’m afraid that a whole generation of kids is growing  up never smelling bread baking or sampling a spaghetti sauce that’s been  simmering for hours. I watched my children impatiently tap their feet during  the 40 seconds it took to zap their hot dog in the microwave. The best hot dog  I ever ate sizzled slowly on the end of a branch over a bonfire.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Siestas are nice. Don’t we all have  warm, cozy feelings about resting with graham crackers and juice on a little  rug in kindergarten? I understand that’s been replaced with computer time now.  And there are no siestas for working folk, who are multitasking with a  conference call and checking e-mail while they gulp down an energy bar and a  power drink. Americans leap in and out of their two-minute showers while the  Japanese luxuriate in their restful ritual baths. Those of us who have traded a  desk for a divan could teach them something about savoring the moment, taking  the second to reclaim the “peace that passes all understanding.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>We’re all wearing watches with  alarms and timers to the hundredth of a second. Add to that mix our cell  phones, PDAs, and various flavors of “berries” that keep us marching to a rapid  cadence. Theorists who say Americans will be run out or bought out have  over-calculated. We’re just going to wear out.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My advice is to avoid all things  rapid, speedy, or swift unless you’re young. And if the gleam in your eye is  just the sun reflecting off your bifocals, maybe it’s time to slow down.</p>
