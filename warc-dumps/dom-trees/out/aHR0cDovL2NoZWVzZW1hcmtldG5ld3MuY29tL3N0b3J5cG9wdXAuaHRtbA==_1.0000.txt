					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><strong>By Alyssa Sowerwine</strong></font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">DALLAS — As the U.S. Hispanic population continues to expand, researchers are finding that opportunities for the dairy industry lie in this fast-growing group of consumers.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">A new Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy white paper analyzes the growing Hispanic market and reveals strategies to more effectively meet the needs of this population and expand dairy sales. The paper’s findings were presented at a session Wednesday titled “The New America: Understanding the Hispanic Market” during the International Dairy Show in Dallas.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Session speakers — which included Yocasta Shames, account director for Siboney USA, a Hispanic marketing agency, and Lynn M. Stachura, senior vice president of strategic insights for Dairy Management Inc. (DMI) — note that over the next several years, the number of Hispanic households is expected to increase at a faster pace than any other group in the United States.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Innovation Center white paper states that an estimated 47 million Hispanic residents in the United States represent 15 percent of the total population, with an estimated spending power of more than $951 billion in 2008.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Stachura adds that U.S. Hispanic consumers outspend U.S. non-Hispanic consumers by 9 percent.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The white paper states that the Hispanic population is expected to continue to grow, outpacing total population growth by about 3 to 1. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Hispanic children are a critical base because predictions indicate that they will represent 25 percent of America’s youth by 2020, the paper notes.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The white paper segments Hispanic consumers by level of acculturation, or the process of assimilating into a new culture, which is a strong indicator of consumption patterns, Stachura says. It also examines dairy preferences, perceptions and consumption among foreign-born less acculturated immigrants, foreign-born more acculturated immigrants and U.S.-born Hispanic residents.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The white paper states that milk consumption decreases as the acculturation process progresses. In fact, the less acculturated group consumes almost 50 percent more milk, cheese and yogurt than the most acculturated segment of Hispanic consumers.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This gap could result in the loss of 700 million pounds of fluid milk sales for this segment by 2030, the paper notes.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In addition, there is vast difference in dairy preferences between the less acculturated and more acculturated consumers, states the paper, which notes that whole milk penetration is almost 14 percent higher among foreign-born Hispanics compared with the U.S.-born segment, while drinkable yogurt penetration is almost double, and Hispanic cheese penetration is nearly four times higher.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“By appealing to the unique traditions of the less acculturated group, while recognizing that new habits get layered on, the dairy industry will be better able to maintain dairy consumption and help curb the drop-off,” Stachura says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The white paper also pinpoints specific recommendations to help meet the challenge of creating demand by addressing the traditional needs of these consumers, including messaging, positioning, new product and packaging innovation, and distribution strategies.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“Hispanic consumers in the U.S. are a highly diverse group with different beliefs, customs, experiences and behaviors,” Stachura says. “These cultural differences make it even more important for marketers to understand this audience and develop messaging and programming to meet their unique needs.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Stachura notes that Hispanic consumers tend to use many different channels when shopping and tend to “stock up” on products. At the same time, many also do “just in time” shopping to select items they plan to cook that same day.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In addition, while Hispanic consumers are driven by value, that is not their only concern as many are more brand loyal across dairy categories than non-Hispanic consumers, Stachura says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Stachura notes the dairy industry could benefit from promoting dinner time milk-drinking habits and the benefits of drinking milk over alternative beverages to U.S. Hispanic consumers.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“The consumption of milk at dinner is not a part of the culture in their home countries,” Stachura says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In addition, while research shows Hispanics are frequent consumers of cheese, gaps exist in the varieties available to them, Stachura notes, adding that foreign-born Hispanic consumers are unfamiliar with the taste and uses for many U.S. cheeses and will need education and sampling to help accelerate adoption.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Integration of different cheese types also is an area of possible improvement, she says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“They may be able to get the cheese they are accustomed to at their local bodega, but other American-type varieties aren’t available there,” she explains. “At the same time, larger retail outlets that carry a wide variety of American-style cheeses may not also carry traditional Hispanic varieties.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Stachura notes that many Hispanic consumers also have preconceptions that lower-fat milk varieties are lacking in essential nutrients.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“The industry needs to educate Hispanic consumers about milk’s nutrient profile and reinforce that lowfat milk has the same nutrient package as fuller-fat varieties,” she says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Still, Stachura says research shows that the unique nutrient package found in dairy products is extremely important to Hispanic consumers.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“With the right products and messages, as well as increased distribution where Hispanics shop most, the dairy industry has an opportunity to grow incremental sales,” she says.</font></p>

					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><strong>By Rena Archwamety</strong></font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">MADISON, Wis. — “Local” is ingrained in the fabric of artisan and farmstead cheeses, from small pasture-fed herds that provide fresh milk to an on-farm cheesemaking facility, to community farmers’ markets that sell products from local cheesemakers. But while the tradition and terroir of these cheeses remain local, more specialty and farmstead cheesemakers now are entering the global marketplace. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">European cheeses long have dominated international specialty markets, though as the U.S. specialty cheese movement grows, so does its visibility to the rest of the world. Last year U.S. cheesemakers took home 83 medals in 43 categories at the World Cheese Awards in the Canary Islands, and their achievements at this and other international contests have not gone unnoticed.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“To a certain extent, the United States has had this image of not being a producer of these high-quality cheeses,” says Chris Gentine, who with his wife Julie founded The Artisan Cheese Exchange, a Sheboygan, Wis.-based export management and trading company. “Our cheesemakers themselves have done a fantastic job and made progress in reshaping that image, winning awards and categories in contests traditionally dominated by European cheesemakers.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When Gentine started The Artisan Cheese Exchange in 2006, he says he tried to begin with the “best of the best,” building a portfolio from companies that had won awards at the American Cheese Society contest, World Cheese Championships and World Cheese Awards. In addition to awards, he likes to emphasize the story behind U.S. cheeses, including the history, region and terroir where the cheese was made. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“I outline traditional things like limestone-filtered water, black earth,” Gentine says. “I also like to touch on the history of that region as part of the United States — the immigrant populations, the environmental differences and diversities that have shaped and styled those cheeses going back in time.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">• Exports resume in Europe</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Rogue Creamery, Central Point, Ore., in 2007 became the first U.S. exporter of raw milk cheese to the European Union (EU). Exports of U.S. raw milk cheeses were put on hold last summer as the EU conducted a procedural audit of export processes, documentation and certification. The raw milk cheese certificate was reapproved in July, and Rogue since has sent shipments to France and Germany and expects to resume exports to the United Kingdom (UK) in a few weeks. Rogue Creamery also exports to Japan, and in addition to its own raw milk Blue cheeses, it works with other artisan cheesemakers to export their products.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“It’s a very exciting time that American makers of cheese are now exporting into these markets,” says David Gremmels, co-owner, Rogue Creamery. “What I’m excited about is that the export of farmstead and artisan cheeses certainly is doing big work in changing the view and the preconceived opinions of American cheeses. There is a lot of work to do out there.”   </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Neal’s Yard Dairy, a UK retailer and wholesaler of cheeses with two shops in London, has in the past sold Rogue Creamery’s Rogue River Blue and Dodgeville, Wis.-based Uplands Cheese’s Pleasant Ridge Reserve. Since the company sells a fair amount of British cheese in the United States, representatives from Neal’s Yard Dairy annually attend the American Cheese Society conference, where they first met Gremmels and Uplands Cheese’s head cheesemaker and general manager, Andy Hatch.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Uplands Cheese worked with The Artisan Cheese Exchange to help export its Pleasant Ridge Reserve and has had a relationship with Neal’s Yard Dairy for several years before Neal’s Yard started selling their cheese. Hatch even worked at Neal’s Yard one winter to learn more about British and European cheeses. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Hatch says the relationships he has developed overseas have been useful in learning more about his craft, and Uplands Cheese has started talking to distributors in other countries in Asia and Europe.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“It’s a thrill,” Hatch says. “It’s an exciting new frontier for American cheesemakers. It gives us a lot of pride to see our cheese compete in international markets.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Bronwen Percival, buying manager, Neal’s Yard Dairy, says the company was very impressed by the quality of cheeses from Rogue Creamery and Uplands Cheese.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“American-made cheeses are very rare in Europe, though in some cases they are made to familiar recipes,” Percival says. “While our customers are aware that there is a growing movement in the U.S., they were surprised at the type and quality of the cheeses we brought over. I think they were expecting Cheddar.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The stereotype of American cheese in Europe, Percival says, is a low-quality, flavorless cheese — mostly Cheddar — probably with a plastic wrapper around each slice.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“I think our selling these two American cheeses has challenged people’s preconceptions, which is always a fun thing to do,” Percival says. “The two American cheeses that we have sold have been of excellent quality, and were received very well by our customers. I hope that we will be able to sell more in the future.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Percival says one challenge in selling American cheeses in Europe is their very high price, partly due to duty and transportation costs, but also because U.S. cheeses are two to three times as expensive as their European counterparts.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“Given the high price of American cheese, sales are limited to shops willing to sell on flavor, drawing in people who appreciate good flavor enough to pay for it,” Percival says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">• Introducing cheeses to Asia</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Artisan Cheese Exchange focuses primarily on exporting cheeses to Asia. The company also has pockets in the Caribbean and South America and has exported small amounts of cheese to the United Kingdom, but Gentine says exports to Europe have slowed a lot, particularly after the recent hold on raw milk cheeses. Competition from longer-established cheesemakers in Europe also makes the European market difficult for U.S. cheeses to enter.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“It’s really a long project to enter into these markets,” Gentine says. “It’s not just as simple as, ‘You have great cheeses and have won awards, how many can we line up?’ There are a lot of powerful global competitors, and they have a couple </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">hundred-year head start on us, and a geographical advantage.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">While there are competitive challenges to marketing U.S. artisan cheeses in Europe, there can be different types of challenges to marketing these in Asia, where cheese is not part of the traditional diet.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The California Milk Advisory Board (CMAB) has an international program that started in 2008 to increase exports of California dairy products, including artisan cheese, to markets such as Mexico and Asia. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“Cheese is new to most consumers in Asia and it is not as well entrenched as an ingredient, so we not only face the challenge of resistance to trying cheese ‘straight,’ we also need to demonstrate recipe ideas for people to use cheese in cooking,” says Ross Christieson, international consultant, CMAB. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">CMAB has developed recipe books, and Christieson says in China, for example, CMAB samples traditional foods like fried rice with cheese. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Pizza is another “entry level” way cheese is introduced to consumers in Asia, according to Mark Todd, a culinary consultant known as “The Cheese Dude” who also helps CMAB conduct demos in Asian countries.   </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Todd uses a base Mozzarella and Provolone blend on the pizza and adds artisan cheeses on top. Most Asian consumers will say they like mild cheeses, Todd adds, but when they try cheeses, they often gravitate toward stronger varieties. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“They go nuts for Blue cheese, and it’s the really strong-flavored ones they seem to enjoy,” Todd says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Gentine says he hits certain pockets in the world where slight flavor differences in U.S. cheeses may fit certain cultures’ palates. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">For example, in Hong Kong he sells a specialty Blue that does particularly well due to its sweet, fruity notes. The retailer was surprised because Blue cheese typically doesn’t sell well in Hong Kong. Gentine says customers did not like the more acidic nature of European Blue cheeses, but the sweeter U.S. Blue was a better match for their palates.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Other times, Gentine says, flavors he thinks would really work are not so pleasing to people.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“We took a jalapeño Jack to Korea, and they said, ‘Wow, that’s really sharp.’ We said, ‘I’ve had red chili paste that feels like it will burn my face off,’” he says. “But it’s a different kind of heat. For this individual, it was too spicy.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Though cheese is a relatively new part of Asian diets, exporters say U.S. artisan cheeses generally are well-received there and growing in demand.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“Wherever we have promoted the products, we have received a great reaction to the excellent range and variety of our products, as well as their outstanding quality,” Christieson says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">He adds that in Asia, there is a strong correlation between economic development and high-quality cheese consumption.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“The countries that have strongly-developed economies like Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong already have well-established artisan cheese markets.” </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Gentine says the amount of cheese he is exporting has grown, and the perception of U.S. food as clean, safe products is a plus.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“The awareness is becoming, ‘Wow, these are really nice.’ I think we’re gaining in selling consistency and quality, something we really do well here in the U.S.,” Gentine says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">• Innovative thinking</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Exporting artisan cheeses around the world not only will help promote the image of U.S. cheeses, Gentine says. It also will help cheesemakers in the long run to expand their creativity and make cheeses that appeal to different markets.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“I think over the long haul, it’s going to be an important piece of how our country is viewed by the global marketplace, continuing to build on that quality, consistency and innovative thinking that certainly goes into our industry,” Gentine says.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Vella Cheese, Sonoma, Calif., started exporting its Jack cheeses to Japan a couple of years ago through The Artisan Cheese Exchange and also takes part in CMAB’s international export program. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“Next year the business is 80 years old, and I don’t think my grandfather foresaw that we would ever sell his cheese in Japan,” says Chickie Vella, Vella Cheese.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Vella’s son Gabriel is the newest cheesemaker at the family-owned company, and Vella says she doesn’t think exporting is as foreign an idea to him as it would have been for previous generations.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“It’s interesting how to my son, it’s commonplace. Three generations with three different experiences,” she says.</font></p>

					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives this week approved The Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2010 (S. 3656), which includes mandatory weekly electronic reporting for dairy products.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The legislation also reauthorizes for five years other price reporting programs run by USDA, including mandatory reporting for wholesale pork cuts. It requires livestock sales information to be reported and published in a timely fashion, allowing buyers and sellers to make more informed decisions.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“The transparent, timely and accurate market information provided by mandatory price reporting programs is a vital and necessary tool for agriculture producers,” says Collin Peterson, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. “I appreciate the support of the farmers, processors and packers to help us reauthorize mandatory price reporting requirements and improve the availability of market data.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The price reporting bill contains the following specifications:</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">• Amending section 273 of the Agriculture Marketing Act of 1946 to require the Secretary to establish an electronic reporting system for dairy.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">• Directing the U.S. secretary of agriculture to publish the information reported through the electronic reporting system each Wednesday by 3 p.m. Eastern time.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">• Requiring the secretary to implement the electronic reporting system for dairy not later than one year following enactment of this act.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The House Agriculture Committee passed mandatory price reporting legislation (H.R. 5852) July 28, and to ensure timely implementation, the House approved an identical bill passed by the Senate. The act will become law once President Obama signs the legislation.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Industry groups that long have worked for more transparency in dairy pricing are applauding the passage of this bill. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) helped to include mandatory price reporting language in the 2008 Farm Bill, but that measure was contingent on available funding, and USDA never has had adequate funding to implement dairy price reporting.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“NMPF believes a key element of improved dairy marketing is accurate, timely price information,” says Jerry Kozak, president and CEO, NMPF. “After years of half-measures, the Mandatory Price Reporting Act will ensure that the USDA implements to the fullest mandatory dairy price reporting.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The National Farmers Union (NFU) also joined several agricultural organizations in advocating for this reauthorization and welcomes the transparency and new market information mandatory price reporting will provide.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“This is vital for U.S. farmers and ranchers in current economic times,” says Roger Johnson, president, NFU. “The current Mandatory Price Reporting provisions were reauthorized until Sept. 30, 2010, so it is important that President Obama sign this legislation as soon as possible.”</font></p>

					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">ARLINGTON, Va. — Cooperatives Working Together (CWT) and one of its members are suing a livestock auction market in Greenville, Ill., for allegedly violating the terms of CWT’s herd retirement program.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), which operates CWT, joined Illinois dairy farmer Kevin Kessler and Kessler Dairy Inc. as a third plaintiff in the civil action “Kessler v. Greenville Livestock Auction,” filed in the Circuit Court for St. Clair County, Ill. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Kessler was a successful bidder in the recent CWT 2010 herd retirement program operated by NMPF, under which CWT paid Kessler to retire his herd of 340 dairy cows. One of the requirements of the CWT herd retirement program is that accepted herds must be sent immediately to slaughter. According to the suit, Kessler sold his herd to Greenville Livestock Auction on the express condition that the herd would then be sold to a slaughter facility. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Kessler and NMPF contend that Greenville Livestock Auction did not sell the herd to a slaughter facility as it had contracted to do, but instead sold some of the cows as replacements to another dairy farm. The suit alleges that Greenville Livestock Auction breached its contract to sell the cows for slaughter, unjustly enriched itself by buying cows at a beef price under false pretenses and then reselling them at a much higher replacement price, and committed fraud in violation of the common law and the Illinois consumer protection statute.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“CWT always takes seriously claims that individuals may be attempting to take unfair advantage of the program,” says Jerry Kozak, president and CEO, NMPF. “We investigate every one of those allegations. In this case, there is convincing evidence that the auction market to which a CWT member sold his cows has defrauded the program, and we are pursuing legal action not just on behalf of Kevin Kessler, but for the tens of thousands of other farmers who support CWT.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This is the first legal action over such a matter CWT has had to take in the seven-year history of its herd retirement program, according to Jim Tillison, senior vice president of marketing and economic research, NMPF, and chief operating officer, CWT.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">“The one thing about this program, since it’s a voluntary program, we have a lot of eyes out there watching what’s going on,” Tillison says. “Fortunately in occurrences other than this, we have found people were mistaken in terms of what they thought had happened.”</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Tillison adds that Kessler did everything he was required to by CWT in selling his cattle, but it appears the sales yard did not. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">JR Hugo, manager of Greenville Livestock Auction, says the auction company has not yet been served any paperwork regarding the lawsuit, so they are unable to make any comment.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Kessler and National Milk Producers Federation are represented in this action by its outside general counsel, Kevin J. Brosch of DTB Associates LLP, Washington D.C.; James A. McGurk, Chicago; and Russell K. Scott of Greensfelder, Hemken &amp; Gale, P.C., Belleville, Ill.</font></p>
