Just a short message to let everybody know that the WWII mod is now available for download. Both the Winter mod and Desert mod are ready for your pleasure.

One more thing the modules are RC and small change/corrections might be applied.

Read and download at www.salientgames.com (http://www.salientgames.com) .

Hi. I can see how to add a ww2 terraindb to a random map scenario, but is it possible to add it to a sm scenario? Or does a scenario come with a built in terraindb like it does a unitdb? Thanks.

I think it's like the unit database.

Can convert maps easy enough with the conversion tool.

Scenario's are another matter; has something to do with removing all units and/or substituting with replacement database.

Just haven't had time to look further into this.


I have scripts - for Enhanced EDEE [HCDB] to WW2 Terrain(s) and Vice versa... Tested and works... will release that in a bit as well...

Weasel, it looks like you made a very nice mod. It's obvious a lot of work went into it. Just way too many units for my personal taste. But I like your terrain and am looking forward to the jungle one as well. There are almost 300 scenarios that I converted to SoloMod and it would be nice to play them using your terrain. It looks like the only way to do this is to rename the terraindb prior to opening edee. Maybe Mark has an answer.

rich12545

Did you try any of the different configurations?

This was meant to solve the way too many unit concern.

Try the "Basic" config version.

Also rich12545; send me one scenario/map along with Solomod unitdb.ini and I will see if I can convert it over using a script. If it works I'll send you over the conversion script(s).

I need the unitdb.ini to match units as best I can.

This way it may be possible to have your scenario's setup in the WW2 mod. All three versions of WW2 Mod.

Make sure you represent all your unit id's with some sort of description.
So I have a better idea of what a unit does or is. To make the best possible match ups of unit types/class...

My satellite crashed a few weeks ago and I'm now on a slow dialup. So any file more than 5 megs requires an overnighter. Your mod is 11 so I haven't downloaded it yet but really like the screenies of the terrain. I'll get one of them tonight and try a basic config and see.

Before sending you stuff I'd like to see what Mark has to say about a workaround. It might be possible to somehow convert a SM scenario to a SM scenario with a different terraindb.

Weasel, I talked my wife into letting me use the internet to download one of your ww2 mods. It truly is a great piece of work. The basic still has too many units for my taste though. And how does the ai use pilots/crews?

Basic set should have about the same amount as standard EDEE; perhaps I included more than I thought?


Basic -- ahh yes, forgot the Pilots and crews would be in there.

Pilots, crews - for humans -- Sorry - overlooked that aspect.

I hope to be delving into the AI source code to make that happen someday.

But anyways; sure do appreciate you taking your time to download and try...

LOL. The standard edee has way too many units for my taste.

I think what I'm going to do is add some of your terrain graphics to the standard terraindb folder for the scenarios and then use your terrains for random maps as well. Except for the city graphics. The ones made by Ralph Ivy (that I incorporated in SoloMod) are better.

Very nice. Made by Ralph Ivy. I downloaded them maybe two and a half years ago either from the edee extras page here or the yahoo mod forum. Don't remember which. And I no longer have the original file. Feel free to use them from my SoloMod game but give credit to Ralph and not to me.

Actually these are unit graphic files and not terrain ones.
