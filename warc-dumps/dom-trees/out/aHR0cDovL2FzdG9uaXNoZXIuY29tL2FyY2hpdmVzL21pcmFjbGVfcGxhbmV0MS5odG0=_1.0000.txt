						<h1><i><font size="4">From PBS-TV...</font></i><br>
							The Miracle Planet</h1>
						<p><em><font size="4"><strong>MY KIDS REMEMBER </strong>
    <u>The Miracle Planet</u> TV series as a big event in our family because it required the purchase of a TV and VCR.</font></em></p>
						<p><font size="4"><em>When I look back at the six <a href="#script">scripts</a> I wrote for the series, though, what strikes me now is how many hunches KCTS-TV Director Barry Stoner and I played, and how well the science has fallen into line behind in the years that followed.</em></font></p>
    <p><em><font size="4">For instance, Luis and Walter Alvarez's theory that a meteorite-caused natural catastrophe killed the dinosaurs was still highly speculative then, but <u>The
    Miracle Planet</u> understood the importance of the idea, and how it connected to the big
    picture. </font></em></p>
						<p><font size="4"><i>It wasn't until 1991, two years after <u>The Miracle Planet</u> series debuted on PBS-TV and almost four years after this script was written, that scientists located the impact site of the meteor that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, Chicxulub crater off what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula</i></font></p>
						<p><font size="4"><i>And another 20 years would pass before rock samples recovered from Graphite Peak, Antarctica, would indicate that a meteor impact may have also caused the "great dying" that occurred 250 million years ago, the so-called Permian-Triassic (or P-T) mass extinction, which was the world's worst.</i></font></p>
						<p><em><font size="4"><b>IN ADDITION</b> to a TV and VCR, working on <u>The
      Miracle Planet</u> gave me the broad natural sciences education I'd somehow evaded in school.</font></em></p>
						<p><em><font size="4">The challenges of writing for the TV camera proved educational as well. </font></em><em><font size="4">When we started filming the series, for instance, it quickly became apparent that the narrator, Bill Kurtis, couldn't move both ways on the emotional scale. </font></em></p>
						<p><em><font size="4">He could downshift his pacing and mood -- the verbal equivalent of a diminuendo -- but he couldn't move the other way, increasing his pace and emotional intensity as he played out the narrative.</font></em></p>
						<p><em><font size="4">Oh, really? Kurtis, who came from CBS Radio, was essentially a guy who couldn't handle the ball to his forehand at all, and so to make him look credible on camera I had to serve him a steady diet of balls to his backhand, which is a fairly bizarre way to tell a story.</font></em></p>
						<p><em><font size="4"><b>BUT&nbsp;IT&nbsp;ALL</b> worked out well. The <u>Miracle Planet</u> went on to be one of PBS-TV's most popular earth science shows, won a bunch of awards, and spawned </font></em><em><font size="4">t</font></em><em><font size="4">he gorgeous <u>The Miracle Planet</u> book, which was largely the work of my wife Lane Morgan.</font></em></p>
						<p><em><font size="4">The <u>Miracle Planet</u> book was, in fact, a major undertaklng in itself, with its own daunting slew of editorial, scientific and trans-oceanic production challenges (the book was published by an Australian publisher, while Lane and I lived in the United States).</font></em></p>
						<p><em><font size="4">Ultimately translated into four languages and published globally, Lane's <u>Miracle Planet</u> book remains a dazzling demonstration of just how good a coffee table book can be.    </font></em></p>
