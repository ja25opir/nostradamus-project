                <h2>Dog  Training Exercises</h2>
                <p>When a puppy first starts exhibiting behaviors that are not desirable, start teaching them counter conditioning exercises. An exercise for chewing could be to redirect your puppy from a non-desirable object to retrieve a ball. Teach them  “drop” at an early age. You should not throw a ball very far at first. Have them on a leash so you can direct them back to you once they have the ball. If the ball is not exciting enough you can tie a string on to it and give it some movement. Most puppies will retrieve if you make the  game exciting.</p>
