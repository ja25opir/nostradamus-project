            An initial rapid assessment was made for life-threatening problems 
            (called primary survey). Sasha's problems included: mental depression, 
            labored breathing, early decompensatory shock), rapid heart rate (240 
            beats per minute), weak, irregular pulses, and significant cranial 
            abdominal distention. Percussion of the abdomen demonstrated tympany, 
            suggestive of a gas distended stomach, compatible with gastric-dilatation-volvulus 
            (GDV) syndrome.</p>

            The GDV syndrome occurs the stomach rotates at the level of the esophagus 
            within the abdomen, causing gas accumulation within the stomach and 
            gastric distension (Figure 1). Blood supply to the stomach and spleen 
            can be significantly compromised.</p>

            stomach rotation, fix the stomach into normal position, and examine 
            other organs that might be affected. Common complications include: 
            anesthetic risks, stomach necrosis due to impaired circulation, blood 
            clots in major vessels, rupture of blood vessels due to the distension 
            and rotation of the stomach, and splenic damage due to the obstruction 
            of its blood vessels by the stomach.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Emergency Surgical Correction</strong><br>
            A combination of anesthetic agents were chosen that had minimal effect 
            on the cardiovascular system and induction and intubation so that 
            his breathing could be rapidly controlled. The abdomen was clipped 
            and scrubbed for surgery. An abdominal incision was made. The stomach 
            was immediately seen to be hugely distended with gas, rotated and 
            the stomach wall was black due to loss of blood supply and necrosis 
            (Figure 5). The stomach was de-rotated, a stomach tube passed for 
            relieving the gas, and the dead area of the stomach wall was removed. 
            The stomach was then attached to the body wall (called a “gastropexy”) 
            to prevent rotation in the future. The spleen was found to have an 
            infarct, and that area was removed. The pancreas was swollen.<br>

            Animal Emergency Clinic for signs of coughing, sneezing and not feeling 
            well. The owner had been sick with influenza for 2 weeks. She knew 
            that ferrets are susceptible to the human influenza virus and was 
            concerned. Popo had not eaten well that day.</p>
          <p class="bodycopy">A physical examination was done and found Popo to 
            be depressed, dehydrated, and to have labored breathing. At this time, 
            he weighed only one pound. He was admitted to the hospital and a catheter 
            was placed and intravenous fluids and antibiotics were administered. 
            Blood work was done, confirming dehydration. His other blood parameters 
            were normal. Radiographs were taken and showed that Popo had developed 
            pneumonia. The infection had spread to the entire lung fields on the 
            right side of his chest. This lung pathology was most likely the reason 
            for his difficulty breathing.</p>
          <p class="bodycopy">The next day Popo appeared to be getting worse in 
            spite of the fluids and antibiotics. The owner was contacted and surgery 
            was recommended to remove the infected lung lobes. It was felt that 
            the infection was causing lung abscesses and could not be treated 
            effectively with medications alone. The risks were discussed and the 
            owner agreed to surgery.</p>
          <p class="bodycopy">That afternoon Popo was taken to surgery. Because 
            of his small size, the anesthesia and surgery were very delicate procedures. 
            The emergency/critical care specialist planned a balanced anesthesia 
            protocol using both injectable and gas anesthetic. </p>

          <p class="bodycopy">The surgeons were very concerned about performing 
            chest surgery on such a small animal. Though there had never been 
            any written reports about chest surgery on a ferret in United States, 
            the board certified surgeon used her experience with the dog and cat 
            to plan out the procedure.<br>
            The chest was opened and all of the right lung lobes were found to 
            be completely infected. The surgeons decided to remove all the right 
            lung lobes knowing that most animals can live with only 1/2 of the 
            lung lobes in tact. The surgery was very difficult because of Popo’s 
            small size. The procedure took approximately 2 hours to perform. A 
            chest tube was placed into the right side of his chest so that extra 
            fluid and air could be removed from his chest after surgery. Popo 
            woke up well after the surgery.</p>

            explore the mandible and obtain excisional biopsies for a histopathological 
            diagnosis. The premolars (#305 and #306) would be extracted and the

            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="bodycopy">Comet is a 7-year-old Labrador retriever. At the 
            beginning of February 2007, Comet began having choking episodes and 
            coughing. He was taken to his veterinary office, where a physical 
            examination revealed enlarged lymph nodes in multiple locations. A 
            fine needle aspirate on one of the lymph nodes was taken. This sample 
            was consistent with high-grade lymphoma. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Lymphoma is a relatively common cancer in dogs. 
            It is a cancer of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) and lymphoid 
            tissues. Lymphoid tissue is normally present in many places in the 
            body, including lymph nodes, spleen, liver, digestive tract and bone 
            marrow. In most cases, we cannot tell what causes lymphoma. The most 
            common form is involvement of one or more of the external lymph nodes 
            similar to what Comet had. Many dogs may not feel sick or may have 
            only very mild signs such as tiredness or decreased appetite. Other 
            dogs may have more severe signs such as weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, 
            excessive thirst or urination, weakness, or difficulty breathing. 
            The severity of the signs depends upon the extent of the disease and 
            on whether the cancer has caused changes in organ function. Often, 
            the only noticeable sign is an enlargement of the lymph nodes under 
            the neck, behind the knees or in front of the shoulders. Other organs, 
            such as the liver, spleen and bone marrow can be involved as well. 
          </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma. 
            Lymphoma is very sensitive to chemotherapy, and up to 90% of dogs 
            treated will go into remission when our most effective treatment protocols 
            are used. The definition of remission is the complete disappearance 
            of all signs of cancer. A remission is NOT a cure but it does allow 
            pets to experience a good quality of life. It is important to remember 
            this because chemotherapy should not be discontinued as soon as a 
            remission is achieved. The length of remission depends upon many factors 
            including the primary site, how sick an animal is at the start of 
            treatment, blood calcium level, and the extent of disease. For those 
            dogs, like Comet, that have the most common type (external lymph nodes 
            enlarged) and are treated with the most effective treatment protocol, 
            the average survival time is about 12-14 months; approximately 25% 
            of dogs may live longer than 2 years. Unfortunately without treatment, 
            most dogs will succumb to their disease within 4-6 weeks. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Compared to people receiving chemotherapy, pets 
            experience fewer and less severe side effects. because we use lower 
            doses of drugs and do not combine as many drugs as in human patients. 
            The normal tissues that are most sensitive to chemotherapy are the 
            intestinal lining, the bone marrow (which makes new blood cells), 
            and hair follicles. Toxic effects to the digestive tract are responsible 
            for decreased appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. In most cases, these 
            signs are mild and usually resolve on their own or with oral medication 
            given at home. We seldom see severe side effects; it is estimated 
            to be less than 5% of all pets receiving chemotherapy will have a 
            side effect requiring hospitalization. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">After discussing options for treatment, Comet’s 
            owner elected to begin therapy with chemotherapy. Comet’s treatment 
            will consist of 4 cycles of a combination of chemotherapy medications. 
            During the first phase of his treatment (called induction), Comet 
            will get four weekly treatments followed by one week off. This is 
            repeated for another 4 weekly treatments and then Comet will go to 
            every other week therapy.</p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Comet was given his first dose of chemotherapy on 
            March 2, 2007.</p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Update:<br>
            3/8/2007 - Comet returned today for his second dose of chemotherapy. 
            He is feeling great and his cough is much improved. His lymph nodes 
            are much smaller as well, his appetite is good, and his weight is 
            stable. </p>

            A Wonderful Cat with Wonderful Owners<br>
            </strong><strong><span class="bodycopy">A Case of Feline lymphoma</span></strong><br>
          </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Taj is an 18-year-old Maine Coon. Last August he 
            presented to the Animal Emergency Center emergency service for fever, 
            lethargy, weight loss and difficulty using his hind legs. A physical 
            examination revealed that Taj was thin (6 1/2 lbs). He had a fever 
            (Temp = 104 F: normal = 101.5 F), was dehydrated, and had difficulty 
            walking on his rear legs. Taj was admitted to the hospital for intravenous 
            fluids to help correct his dehydration and help to lower his temperature. 
            Basic diagnostic tests were preformed to try to identify the cause 
            of Taj's illness. Blood work revealed a mild anemia and a mild elevation 
            in kidney enzymes. A urine sample contained bacteria indicating Taj 
            had a urinary tract infection. Taj was started on intravenous antibiotics. 
            After one night in the hospital, Taj's temperature was normal and 
            he was eating again on his own. He was discharged with oral antibiotics 
            and scheduled to recheck in a few days. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Taj returned the following evening, now with vomiting 
            and diarrhea. His temperature was normal at presentation but he was 
            again dehydrated and lethargic. Repeated blood work showed that the 
            kidney values were more elevated and his anemia had gotten worse. 
            The owners allowed more advanced diagnostics. An abdominal ultrasound 
            was performed to evaluate Taj's kidneys and other organs in his abdomen. 
            The ultrasound showed that Taj's kidneys were smaller than normal 
            indicating some kidney disease, most likely associated with advanced 
            age. Taj also had some enlarged lymph nodes in his abdomen associated 
            with his intestines. A needle was placed in some of the lymph nodes 
            and cells were aspirated for examination under the microscope (cytology). 
            A consultation was obtained with Dr. Rachel Reiman from the oncology 
            service. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">The cells were examined by Dr. Reiman and the diagnosis 
            of lymphoma (or lymphosarcoma) was made. Lymphoma is one of the most 
            common cancers diagnosed in cats. It is a cancer of the lymphocytes 
            (a type of white blood cell) and lymphoid tissues. Lymphoid tissue 
            is normally present in many places in the body including lymph nodes, 
            spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. Cats of any 
            age, breed and sex can be affected. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Lymphoma can be divided into several different forms, 
            which depend upon the predominant location of the tumor (Table 1). 
            Some cats have multiple sites of involvement and do not fit well into 
            just one category. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma. 
            Lymphoma is very responsive to chemotherapy and up 75% of treated 
            cats will have the complete disappearance of all signs of cancer (remission). 
            However, microscopic amounts of tumor cells can remain hidden in the 
            body. A remission is NOT a cure but it does allow your cat to experience 
            a good quality of life. Because of this, chemotherapy should not be 
            discontinued as soon as remission is obtained. The length of remission 
            depends upon many factors, including the primary site, the degree 
            of illness at the start of treatment, FeLV status, and the extent 
            of disease. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Most cats tolerate their chemotherapy well with 
            minimal side effects. Serious side effects are seen in less than 5% 
            of the cats treated. Side effects might include nausea, vomiting and 
            loss of appetite, diarrhea, tiredness or infection. If side-effects 
            are serious or intolerable, steps will be taken to eliminate or reduce 
            these effects to a tolerable level. Cats do not lose their hair, but 
            may lose their whiskers and develop a different texture to their fur. 
          </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Taj had the gastrointestinal form of lymphoma. Without 
            treatment most cats will succumb to this disease rapidly. They will 
            often continue to lose weight, stop eating or have worsening vomiting 
            and/or diarrhea. Taj's owner elected to begin chemotherapy treatments 
            with the oncology team. Taj had a high-grade form of lymphoma so a 
            more aggressive chemotherapy protocol was needed. Taj was given weekly 
            injections of chemotherapy drugs for the first 8 weeks, and then he 
            was given injections every other week. Taj seemed to handle these 
            treatments fairly well with only a few episodes of vomiting and anorexia. 
            Throughout treatment, Taj gained weight very slowly. In the first 
            month of treatment he went up to seven pounds. He seemed to hover 
            in this range for most of his treatment. </p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Taj finished chemotherapy on May 4th, 2006. He comes 
            in for periodic rechecks and remains in complete remission. He is 
            now up to 8 pounds! </p>

                    some of the lymph nodes surrounding the intestines. Cats with 
                    this type of lymphoma may have vomiting, diarrhea, weight

                    with Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV). Symptoms include difficulty

                    white blood cells that fight infection and platelets that

            wound care to the sites where pins and wires exited the skin. The 
            external fixator was bandaged to prevent Kody from catching it on 
            furniture and to prevent him from hitting people and objects with 
            his fixator. Restricting his exercise was hard, but Kody's owners 
            did a great job of limiting his activity to help his bones heal.<br>
            Kody did develop minor pin tract infections which were managed with 
            antibiotic therapy. As his bone grew stronger some of the pins and 
            wires were removed from Kody's leg. This procedure is not painful 
            and Kody tolerated pin removal without any medication.</p>
          <p class="bodycopy"><strong>After 8 weeks, Kody's external fixator is 
            coming off!</strong></p>
          <p class="bodycopy">Kody's bones will continue to strengthen as the 
            fracture site remodels. Restricted exercise for the next 4-6 weeks 
            is still important after the external fixator is removed to allow 
            the bone to adapt back to life without the external fixator.</p>
