While you may make limited copies of your travel itinerary (and related documents) for travel or services booked through this Website, you agree not to otherwise modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell or re-sell any information, software, products, or services obtained from or through this Website.

<p>You acknowledge that some suppliers offering certain services and/or activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.</p> 
 
<p>Supplies of Special Rate Hotel reservations and Special Fare air products for travel in EU destinations are provided to you by Travelscape.</p> 
 
<p class="faq_title">PRIVACY POLICY</p> 
 
<p>Please review our current <a href="/privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a>, which also governs your use of this Website, to understand our practices.</p> 
 
<p class="faq_title">PRICES</p> 
 
<p>You acknowledge that the authorities in certain countries may impose certain additional taxes (tourist tax, etc), which have to be paid locally. You are exclusively responsible for paying such additional taxes.</p> 
 
<p>The hotel suppliers invoice us, including, where appropriate, tax amounts. The hotel suppliers remit the applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. The tax recovery charges which we charge you on prepaid hotel transactions represent the estimated transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc) that we pay to the hotel supplier in connection with your hotel reservations. They do not represent a collection of taxes from you for us to remit to the applicable tax authorities. The actual tax amounts paid by Travelscape to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers.</p> 
 
<p>IAN does not act as co-vendor with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location.</p> 
 
<p class="faq_title">PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONS</p> 
 
<p>IAN's corporate affiliate Travelscape pre-negotiates certain room rates with hotels. You authorize IAN to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges and service fees. You agree that your credit card will be charged by Travelscape for the total reservation price.</p> 
 
<p>You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival), you will be subject to a charge of applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation. You must make refund requests for no-shows or early checkouts within 60 days after checkout.</p> 
 
<p>You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some reservations cannot be changed or cancelled after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.</p> 
 
<p class="faq_title">TRAVEL DESTINATIONS</p> 
 
<p>Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. We urge passengers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the their government prior to booking travel, particularly when travelling to international destinations.</p> 
 
<p>BY OFFERING FOR SALE TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR DESTINATIONS, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.</p>
