What our Members are saying about Sugarlanes

I cannot tell you just how excited I am to be a member of your site.You are the best, I have always dreamed of learning how to make the figures, but I could not find anyone that really teaches how to make them other than the few people who do workshops but they are never in my particular area. So when I saw your site I had to sign up and I got so much more than I had expected. I look forward to each week anticipating what you are going to teach us, thanks so much for all you do. I have recently purchased your how to dvd's and let me say its like having you in my home teaching me one on one keep the coming please I want to learn it all!!!!

I have learned more in 3 weeks than I have in 2 yrs of doing cakes, you really know how to explain things in detail. The biggest thing that I love is the fact that you start from beginning to end on your how to videos explaining all the techniques. There are other sites out there that do videos but they never show how to get the cake started so I appreciate that very much. The cakes that you have shown us are so exciting they deal with the latest techniques which is what I wanted to learn, not the old style things.

While searching the internet in the middle of the night and came across your website, wow! I was so excited to find such a fantastic resource with videos that show cake decorating. I have always dreamed of finding such a site, I have now opened my own cake business from home because of your teachings. You cover all the latest details in cake decorating which was most important to me and I want you to know I will be forever grateful for all that your website does for those of us who are visual people.

What Members are Saying

Just wanted to drop you a email to let you know how much I am loving my subscription to your website I have been on here night and day watching all the how to videos that you offer as well as reading all the spectacular information that you have on the site for people like myself who are just getting started and have no clue where to begin. Thanks so much for all your encouragement, your emails have come just when I needed to to know I am not alone in this, as you know I was so overwhemled just trying to do the basics. I thank you and your staff for everything that you do for us. Have a very blessed day.

To the staff at Sugarlanes... This is Carol I have been a member for 4 months now, I signed up because I wanted to learn how to create your adorable figures. I have watched some of the youtube videos but they do not do any justice in comparison to what you do here on the site. I have finally finished making the sleeping baby and wanted you to see the photo of it. I am so proud of myself being able to finally create something that actually looks like the baby that you created in the how to video. My hats off to you and your sculpting abilities, now if I could be half as good as you then I would be on my way. Maybe someday huhhh! I can't wait to learn how to make more gumpaste figures Donna, we want more of them please! Thank you for all your help.
