<p><em>Today’s post <a href="http://americanbedu.com/2009/09/21/a-saudi-woman-shares-her-experiences/">continues</a> with part two of how one Saudi woman changed her entire life around….</em></p>
<p><em>How did you rebuild a new life for yourself?</em><br>
Initially Prayer, counseling and a lot of support from some family<br>
members . After some time &nbsp;I took &nbsp;TOEFL and SAT and got admission to<br>
an US university and came on a student visa. I lived initially with my<br>
brother and family and then after 1 yr I moved to the dorms and then<br>
to a house with 4 girls and I knew what it was to be free. I could not<br>
have done this without &nbsp;my brother’s family Insha’Allah. Keeping<br>
occupied and busy helped a lot.</p>
<p><em>How did you meet the man who is now your husband? &nbsp;What was your<br>
courtship like? &nbsp;How long did you know him before realizing you wanted<br>
to marry?</em><br>
My husband worked with my SIL. Every year my brother and SIL host a<br>
gathering of doctors who volunteer with them – that year it was on the<br>
beach. I met my husband the 2nd yr I was in school when I accompanied<br>
my brothers family. I was the only hijabi there and I didn’t talk<br>
much. My SIL slowly involved me in many activities and I started<br>
talking to everyone and found him very open and funny.<br>
we then met often since he was working in the same university hospital<br>
where I was studying – After about 2 yrs he proposed to me, I too<br>
loved him but I wanted to get my brothers permission, so I asked him<br>
to talk to my brother, being a very wise man spoke to my SIL. my<br>
brother can never say no to her , he told me I could marry anyone I<br>
wanted but I should stand on my own feet first. so we were married<br>
after another 1.5 yr after he setup practice in his state and got<br>
licensed and I finished my studies and worked for a while.</p>
<p><em>What was your family’s reaction when you remarried and they learned<br>
your new husband is a Christian?</em></p>
<p>My 2 brothers and family here were there for the wedding very happy<br>
.My mom is so happy for me and says all her Dua’s have come true, but<br>
the rest of my family don’t accept me. My father never spoke to me<br>
after that and my other siblings also do not approve. It’s a horrible<br>
feeling to know you are the cause for your family splitting . maybe<br>
i’m not at fault but still I think about it . Yes I know it’s not<br>
right to marry a Christian but one day maybe if Allah wills he will<br>
accept Allah into his heart. but that is not for me to say. I try to<br>
follow the path of Islam and be as good as I can.</p>
<p><em>What was your in-laws reaction when they learned their son wished to<br>
marry a Saudi muslim woman?</em><br>
They didn’t mind . They are very accepting. My MIL does not want us to<br>
live in the kingdom and but they are happy to have me as a daughter.<br>
She taught autistic kids for a long time and is a patient soft person.</p>
<p><em>What advice can you give to other women who find themselves in<br>
intolerable situations where they suffer abuse? &nbsp;How can they protect<br>
themselves? &nbsp;Can they get themselves removed from such a situation<br>
without facing even more repercussions?</em></p>
<p>REMEMBER It is not your fault and it is not god testing your faith. Do<br>
not accept abuse ( physical/mental) – Go to your family, do not hide<br>
it. If your family is not supportive go to your local masjid. Remember<br>
It will happen again no matter how much you try to please him.<br>
Also abuse is not due to the abuser’s loss of control over his<br>
behavior. In fact, it is a choice made by the abuser in order to take<br>
control.<br>
I write this with experience. Sadly if no one will support you I<br>
don’t know what you can do in the kingdom. If your family supports you<br>
get a divorce. I don’t know what else to say – Saudi was then not a<br>
good place to be if you are women and abused, I know some may not<br>
agree but in my case it is the truth. Till my brother came no one<br>
helped me, Many sympathized, many advised, some questioned my faith –<br>
yet no one helped. That is why I have my home for the abused women .</p>
<p>The things I learned after I left my abuser was — don’t isolate<br>
yourself – Seek support – Keep busy – Take care of your health.</p>
<p><em>In closing, are there any other comments you’d like to add?<br>
</em><br>
Yes, I got out of this bad situation thanks to my faith and the help<br>
of my loving family. In turn I felt a need to do something in return.<br>
We have setup an abused women’s shelter, my husband put in all the<br>
trust he inherited from his grandparents into this. My in-laws<br>
volunteer there.<br>
Both my brothers have funded it. I thank them all, especially my<br>
husband for his kind heart. It is easy to say you sympathize but hard<br>
to part with your money. It is open to anyone who needs a home be it<br>
for a day or week or month. We have combined with the local community<br>
college to provide vocational training in various fields. We also have<br>
volunteer counselors and psychologists. We have about 8 women there<br>
today, the home can house about 20 women and it is my dream to one day<br>
expand so we can take women and their children too.<br>
I don’t mean to advertise in this interview but please if anyone you<br>
know is in trouble pl contact Ms. Carol and she can get you in touch<br>
with me. we are very open in our community and easily accessible to<br>
everyone no matter what age or nationality or religion in trouble is<br>
welcome to our home.</p>
<p>I would like to say thanks to Ms. Carol for providing me the<br>
opportunity to tell my story, &nbsp;Thank you and I pray for you and your<br>
family’s happiness. I pray that everyone has a good life and thank you<br>
for reading .

	<p>What a wonderful story.  Regardless of what you may think of religion, the role this lady’s faith played was so interesting to read.  </p>
<p>I only hope the non saudi people who read this understand what it is like to have no support to refuse marriage or speak out when abuse takes place.</p>

	<p>It is great that she learned from her own experience and set something up to help others when she cold.  We know one lady in the Muslim community here in VIrginia who had abuse problems and could find no help in the Muslim community, she had to go to a Christian organisation.</p>
<p>  It is so sad when we cannot help our own.</p>

	<p>One women freed, her eyes opened to a new life, thank god for this. I found it striking that her new husband is christian and it caused family problems. I wish in this world religion wasnt so predjudice. I know muslim women are restricted from marrying other religions, but think of what they can learn from each other. Well, she loved him of her own free will, got on her own feet, what better way to tell a story about love…</p>

	<p>Interesting story. I enjoyed reading it. Remember that if her brothers were not supportive and more open, she will not have this happy ending especially her marriage from a christian. I really appreciate the positive role of her brothers. I conclude that the real abuser is “the family” not only the husbands.<br>
I like very much one of her statments “abuse is not due to the abuser’s loss of control over his<br>
behavior. In fact, it is a choice made by the abuser in order to take control.” That is the truth in my point of view.</p>

	<p>This has got to be the one of the most moving stories I have read about an abused wife in awhile. What I find so fascinating is that she gave back, meaning she is now helping those who are being abused. It truly sounds like she has a true calling–no coincidence there, I think. She is absolutely God send.</p>

	<p>@dude,</p>
<p>Do not get me started, please, so per your comment this would have been a wonderful story if she had married a muslim !!!!! grow up.  faith is between a person and god.  If this lady thinks faith got her thru then more power to her.<br>
If you think she’s done good – bless her and give her your best wishes else give her constructive criticisms as to how to improve. all else is worthless. Anyway the highlight is not her faith, women in every religion get abused, this is about those women getting out, recovering and leading productive lives.. in my opinion giving back is a big bonus.</p>

	<p>So awesome! I’m so happy to hear that everything turned out happy for her. I wish her all the happiness in the world! She sounds like a wonderful person.</p>
<p>I don’t think she should give one single thought into what that ‘father’ thinks about her choices. She didn’t tear that family apart, HE did.</p>
<p>I’m so happy that she is able to do something to help others now. </p>
<p>I agree completely with Medina that the real abuser is “the family” not only the husbands. It would be great if she could get something started in Saudi even if it is just an awareness campaign of some sort.</p>

	<p>One would think that her father would be happy that his daughter has finally found happiness in marriage, a husband who treats her right, and fulfillment in her life in helping other abused women.   Shouldn’t any normal father feel happiness for his daughter getting away from an abusive relationship?  I just don’t get this mentality…</p>

Before Islam girls were buried in sand alive by their fathers because of the fear of dishonor that might happen in the future. You can still think that although Islam has fought very much this mentality but it could be still alive somewhere in deep heart in modern tactics till today.</p>

	<p>Medina,<br>
And AFTER Islam, girls are just buried up to their necks, right? No need to tell me that that is a minority of cases. It was only a minority of cases before as well or else there would not have even been any babies, male or female, born to be buried since all the women to give birth to them would have been dead after birth. That mentality that you think is so far off is NOT! It is very much alive and it is everywhere in the world where there are Muslims. Even in the U.S.</p>

	<p>@Madina,<br>
Situations like this arise purely because, today Muslims especially Arab Muslims practice more of Qawmiya, Asmiya and Tribalism, as opposed to Tawheed.</p>
<p>If you would like to see, today we muslims especially Arabs, etc. just get carried away by any thing western. Like many Muslims stupidly consider Barack Obama as a Muslim or that he would be good to Muslims because his Father was a MUSLIM, duh!!! Obama insisted time and again he is not a muslim, again an another example of Muslim stupidity.</p>
<p>And look at the shabab here, they all like to throw away their traditional clothes for the western clothes. How ever do you know if some one in the west wears our shmagh they are condemned check this out (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7427206.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7427206.stm</a>)<br>
Bottom Line we like to adopt western outfits, but they despise our customs and clothes.</p>
<p>Bottom line what i like to say is that we muslims today are not espousing the true ideals of Islaam instead some of consider that having muslim name, or family or belonging to a particular tribe, etc.  is Islaam</p>
<p>And to others i would like to say, according to Islaam and Quraan, “Faith is not something which one can practice as per their whims and desires and keep it a personal choice between them and god”</p>
<p>“We as muslims gotta practice each and every commandment as in the Quraan no matter what, follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) only then we achieve the status of being muslims”</p>
<p>I know many of ya would not like what i said, but its a fact every muslim who is knowledgeable knows. And I like it that way, i am not here to discuss faith related topics and i shall not respond to such topics as this is not the right forum.</p>

	<p>@Lynn, reread my previous post. The problem is not the Islam. I told you Islam warned against such practice in ayaat  8-9 Surat Al Takweer 81 (and when the girl buried-alive, the young girl buried alive for fear of shame and impoverishment, asks — in rebuke of its slayer —for what sin she was slain (sa’alat, ‘asks’: a variant reading has su’ilat, ‘[she] is asked’, narrating the address directed to her, to which she then responds by saying, ‘I was slain without [having committed] any sin’)”).</p>
<p>You have problems with Muslims? solve it far away from Islam. </p>
<p>@Abu,<br>
I do not think that clothes are related to Islam. the male’s aurah is from knee to naval otherwise he has the full right to wear whatever he likes. Racism is everywhere. I adjust with any clothes suiting me. I do not classify clothes to Islamic or non Islamic. I am with all clothes as long as I am comfortable with it. culture and religion is a big issue and it is hard to discuss it here.</p>

Radha, great comment</p>
<p>Medina, before Islam many tribes including the people at Mecca and medina, believed in the goddess Allat, and women were therefore regarded with a lot more respect as they are now.<br>
Actually right now they are buried in black cloth for their whole lives, and their rights as individuals are constitutionally denied from the moment theu are born to the moment they are dead.</p>
<p>I would actually <em>prefer</em> to die right at the beginning.</p>

	<p>What a wonderful story to read. Strong women make me proud to be a woman. I love how she decided to help those who have been through abuse afterwards. Kudos also to her brothers who chose to help instead of turning their backs and pretending the abuse didn’t matter. I too was surprised that she married a Christian man. I’m sure that hasn’t been easy and the family that doesn’t accept it are just wrong.</p>

	<p>@Carol….Great story.  I’m thrilled about the safe house!!! </p>
<p>Funny, when I became a muslim, the sheikh that signed my papers told me that all I had to do was say the Shahada and I would be muslim.   I’m not saying that everything else is ok, I’m just saying that this is what protects one from hell-fire…the belief in one God, as the First Commandment says.</p>
<p>But, when I came to Saudi Arabia, no one said boo to me about anything until my father died and I visited an Islamic Center here.  And, after that, all the problems started…you’re not a muslim if you don’t cover, you’re not a muslim if you don’t pray,  you’re not a muslim if you don’t go for Haj,  blah, blah, blah.   Well, you know what?, God is the one that leads us on the path.   Yes, to follow Islam exactly to the letter like the Prophet did would be wonderful.  But not everyone can do that in their lives.  The Saudis are forced to oblige, so many go through the actions without believing anything…only afraid that someone might catch them misbehaving. </p>
<p> And who would know unless someone told on them?   People should lead their lives through example and words and deeds and their beliefs….and after making sure the person knows all of the rules of faith, they should back off and let the person find their way.  </p>
<p>God willing, we will all be led on the true path.</p>

	<p>so many interesting comments and I hope that they continue. </p>
<p>I too was so happy on hearing her story and situation that not only she was able to remove herself from it, have such supporting gold medal brothers AND to give back as she has (with assistance and support from her brothers and husband’s family).  This is one exceptionally strong Saudi woman! </p>
<p>I’m sorry to say that I understand the culture and tribal traditions where marrying outside the faith or leaving a marriage can be viewed as dishonor. Until more men, like the brothers of this woman, are willing to stand up to the society and show by actions that they believe in empowering the women, there will continue to be other Saudi women who may be trapped and feel that they do not have any options available. </p>
<p>One time while in the States I accompanied a muslim woman to  see a Sheik as she was having problems in her marriage which included abuse and deceit. She was afraid to go on her own.  I was incensed that she was told to pray and accept Allah’s will.  That SHE should ask forgiveness from Allah and from her husband for going outside of the home with her problems in the first place.</p>

	<p>Medina,<br>
I understood your previous post. You say that Islam stopped baby girls being buried alive. I say BIG DEAL, they just kill them later if they bring dishonor. So Islam obviously did NOT take that mentality away. Until Islam removes the call for Earthly punishments for those who violate a religious law that mentality will never go away.</p>

	<p>Aafke,<br>
That’s an important point you’ve made about Al-Lat goddesses in Arabia – in fact they were removed from Ka’ba and it was converted as a place of worship for Allah. Symbolically, we can see it as the overshadowing of women by the men who followed Muhammad.</p>
<p>Not only that, the Prophet Muhammad’s first wife was a widow who engaged in business independently, while Muhammad worked for her – till she married the Prophet and later he began to preach Islam and in fact he received a lot of support from her, since she was the wealthy one in that family. </p>
<p>Bruno,<br>
You have been only giving promises of a comment for a couple of days, not giving any comments. It appears you stand with this woman’s father and husband because you have a sympathy for Arab men! Remember, silence is consent.</p>

	<p>This is not the only case where women are told that it’s god will and a test  and pray and it won’t be the last either . I’ve also been advised about the test and prayer deal by many a women.. we are our own worst enemy. </p>
<p>It will only change when</p>
<p>a. women start educating their son’s about treating women respectfully  and the future generation learns from them.<br>
b. Men and women , religious and non-religious alike should realize that god up there has much better things to do than sit and randomly test “WOMEN” . See Humans cause trouble god  removes them, God’s  probably looking at abusing idiot men and thinking ” just you come up here asshole and i’ll make you pay “</p>

	<p>What has bothered me living in this part of the world, is all muslims make it seem like they are great people by following the allah thing, they pray 5 times a day, look good to others, but generally are dishonest lying robbers, then on the other hand, I have seen super great muslims that are the nicest and good people. I know this is true in all people, there are good and bad. I guess what i mean is how can one project this good person image going to the mosque and praying and then do bad things, generally bad people are just bad. They pray pray, the next day their trying to double rent out a home they own…cheat you in business, keep your money and wont return it. Isnt judgement day really judgement day, I hope so</p>

	<p>It’s interesting that one is not supposed to go outside the family for help when things get difficult.  One lady went to her MIL when she needed her husband to stop being so abusive with her and her MIL said, “Well, what did you to to him that he would treat you like that?”  :  <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley">   :   My own MIL has said many times that in this society, if anything goes wrong in your marriage, most people will usually blame the woman….even when the man is sooooooo wrong. </p>
<p>Perhaps this fear for women to stand up to men is because he has always been her only form of support and she doesn’t want to upset him????  Or perhaps it’s the fear of being sent back to the father…in a wife’s case.  </p>
<p>Before you can jump from a burning building…you need a soft landing, you know?  Women need to have a nest egg and some kind of back-up in case something goes terribly wrong.</p>

	<p><b>Daisy:</b><br>
I am hurting. To think that I could stand for injustice and people who go against Allah’s word. It is also unfair. Is there any evidence I could be such a person?</p>
<p>I did promise to write something and I will, Insha’Allah. But there are two good reasons why I haven’t produced anything just yet:<br>
First, I don’t want to be hasty in the way I write about the subject and this particular woman’s experience. People have already written things without realizing they were talking about a woman own painful experience and that she might be hurt by their comments. It’s too sensitive and to emotional a topic to write things hastily and risk hurting people’s feelings if you want to assume the best of them. Others have said things that I find offensive to God and and his Prophets.<br>
So I want to take time, till my own and people’s emotions cool down.<br>
Also, I’ve been busy and can’t find the time to seat down for an hour to write.</p>
<p><b>Laura:</b><br>
People who profess something but don’t put their money where their mouth is, are called in my book, but most importantly to me in the Quran: HYPOCRITES.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, the Muslim Ummah (community) is not immune to this disease.<br>
Almighty Allah, speaks of them many times in the Quran. He didn’t say the hypocrites where just Jews or Christians or else. If you want to find out what God Almighty says about the hypocrites, how He defines and characterizes them, open a Quran, or go online check the many Quran explorer, type in “hypocrite” and see how Allah characterizes, defines, describes them each and every single time He mentions them (exalted be He).</p>
<p>It is naive and unwise, to think that because the outward signs of a Muslim, or a Jew or a Christian or any other human being for that matter, project piety, those people are saints. There are no saints in Islam. And God, Allah the Almighty teaches us in the Quran to tell them apart from those who genuinely believe, genuinely strive to reform themselves as enjoined by Him and all His messengers, from Adam to Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon them), but … sometimes fall. </p>
<p>As you say yourself: <i>I have seen super great Muslims that are the nicest and good people.</i>.</p>
<p>And the same could be said of people from other faiths. The fact that religion and faith is ever present in the Saudi society’s social fabric doesn’t preclude us from the wickedness of the hypocrites wherever you stand.</p>
<p>Everything right and True is from Allah. Any mistake is from myself. May He forgive me for my deviances, and may He manifest the Truth on your tongue, my dear reader, so that I may accept it.</p>

	<p>Bruno-’The fact that religion and faith is ever present in the Saudi society’s social fabric doesn’t preclude us from the wickedness of the hypocrites wherever you stand.’</p>
<p>Actually I think the fact that Saudis are not really given a choice in their religion but are forced to appear to abide by Saudi’s religious rules might actually CREATE hypocrites. Same goes for other Muslims anywhere else in the world that feel famililal or societal pressure to conform even though they don’t believe.</p>

	<p>RoseCG,<br>
I believe the purpose of the dowry is supposed to be that ‘nest egg’ if he does her wrong. Problem is, the men (the ones that interpret the book) make it nearly impossible for her to use it. How many times does the Quran have something wonderful for women but then take it away immediately by saying something along the lines of but if she is a righteous, woman of prayer she will not? </p>
<p>I like how this woman’s brother, encouraged her to stand on her own two feet before getting married again. I think that that should be a universal LAW! But, the men are well aware that if all women were able to care for themselves the men would not get away with treating her badly. When women are empowered chauvenistic or ‘traditional’ men feel powerLESS.</p>

	<p>@Lynn,</p>
<p>  Good point on the last comment.  Islam is all about free choice and the intentions you have in your heart about the choices you do make.</p>
<p>  What reward is there in something when you are FORCED to do it?  Very little I would think.  When everyone in a society is FORCED to follow religion and follow it in a certain way it is going to create a situation where society basically encourages hypocrisy.</p>
<p>  As for this lady, I am aware that a female Muslim is forbidden from marrying a non Muslim, but I think as Muslims we ought to wonder what we can do in our communities to make sure a Muslim woman would never want to marry out of her faith.</p>
<p>  When you look at how such a woman was treated by Muslims and the fact that much of her treatment surely was “justified” by others as part of Islam, you can certainly understand in just the smallest way WHY she did it.</p>
<p>  Look at Carol’s example.  A woman told to pray and live with her abuse.  With such incidents as that…….do you still all wonder why women make such choices?</p>

	<p>re Laura:  When I lived in France I was amazed how many people in this generally Roman Catholic country lied and had affairs tout le temps.  They all felt they could go to confession, do penance, and start over.  (Having more affairs lol).  This is the promise all religions hold for many people, a fresh start.(NOT having more affairs lol)…obviously abused by many.</p>
<p>When i read that the new coed uni near Jeddah was only 5% saudi, I was wondering how many qualified saudis did not take the rigorous test due to family pressure.  Although I would be the first to admit that our education system leaves much to be desired, as was sited in the articles.  I think most saudi families would be so afraid that their children might find their own spouse.  You know, even though marrying your own choice is not without problems, you do not have the feeling that your parents won’t support you since it was not their choice.</p>

	<p>The Saudi woman who graciously gave this two part interview wishes to remain anonymous which is respected.  However she did want to address some of the questions or queries raised in the comments.  Her words have been lightly edited towards protecting her identity…</p>
<p>I am happy that the interview started a dialogue.  Maybe my English is not up to par but money for divorce means my brothers had to pay wasta to the judge to grant divorce . and since a visa was given to me for another country they wanted me to get divorce fast and go, like a clean break, so they paid wasta, a lot also but what to do.<br>
so they didn’t pay my ex much money but sometime we have to pay in saudi to move papers </p>
<p>the comments are also lot on why i didn’t marry muslim, i didn’t go and try to find someone else, it just happened.   after 4 yrs i liked him a lot and he’s so nice, and very funny.<br>
so it was not intentional .</p>

	<p>There are so many components in this story that it’s hard to filter the different issues involved: marriage, polygamy, abuse, love, the parents’ responsibility but also our collective one, culture, tradition, religion…how to organize all those different angles of approach of one same experience, making sense of them and drawing the right conclusions but also the right lessons?</p>
<p><b>Is it a story about Islam?</b></p>
<p>One blessed day of Ramadan, Allah (exalted be He) chose Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to revive the message of true pure oneness of God the Almighty. He didn’t come to preach anything new. It was the same message of divine unity preached by Jews and Christians alike but expurgated from all the cultural and human innovations added throughout time. The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) came to revive the message of monotheism. And along, came a new set of rules and social edicts, regarding men and women and their interaction with each other.</p>
<p>It is very clear to readers ever so slightly interested in Islam and I hope to the sister who went through that terrible experience, that at no point in her ordeal was Allah, Islam, the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) in question. It is clear from the Saudi woman’s description herself that at no point in her story the religious legal rules pertaining to marriage first, let alone polygamy, and treatment of women were ever followed by her family, nor her ex.’s: <i>they forced her into marriage, they didn’t allow her a say in her marriage contract, her own father clearly showed a preference for his first wife, the man hardly spent time with them (although it seems that the issue here is more of all hyper-active businessmen that neglect their family, in any country,regardless of culture or religion). </i></p>
<p>So what we have here is a story of a woman who was born in a family whose father didn’t respect God’s Laws and married her off to someone who didn’t respect them either. It is not about Islam being retrograde like some would want you to believe. It is not about the Prophet being unfair either or giving the wrong example.<br>
From the very beginning of the interview, it is obvious that money, power and status played the most critical part. And religion was only a tool at some men’s disposal. It is a story where men, who were given guardianship of over women abused their power to put money, power, social status and cultural customs above God’s Laws. This is reminiscent of the time of Quraish in Makkah where money and status were all powerful in dictating people’s conduct.</p>
<p><b>Is it a story about polygamy?</b></p>
<p>So neither the Islamic faith nor its creed are in question here since they were never followed. Could it be then Polygamy the main issue, the culprit for so much pain and suffering? Maybe.</p>
<p>First “polygamy is [not] atrocious by the standards of all cultures” like some suggest. Polygamy was practiced throughout history and still is practiced not only by Muslims, but by other cultures and religions. Mormons are polygamous. And in my time living in the US I saw many documentaries about the subject and met a few of them. And although there are documented cases of abuse, I don’t think we ought to rush into judgment and just conclude that polygamy all together is bad! It would be like saying: we are facing a global financial meltdown, the culprit must be capitalism all together like some MSM advocate. Let’s get rid of capitalism. It shouldn’t be difficult to understand that just because a few bad apples abusing the system and not being held accountable, the whole system is flawed and need radical change.</p>
<p>Just because there are cases of abuse in polygamy, and this woman’s experience speaks for itself, doesn’t mean that people cannot find comfort and happiness in polygamy. It is one thing not to like or want something. It is a God given right. It is an other thing to forbid what your creator has made lawful. I don’t like lamb. But it’s not and I cannot declare it haram (unlawful) by my own whim. Forbidding what Allah (exalted be He) has made lawful, and making lawful what He has forbidden is certainly not an attitude I would embrace as a Muslim.<br>
It is totally understandable to empathize with this sister’s decision to not want polygamy. How could you not? She got burnt herself. And it is hard to ignore one’s own experience. But to generalize and project one’s experience is not wise nor fair. I know of a perfect example of a Muslim convert in the US who married his first wife, a divorcee with one kid, who herself mentioned polygamy to her husband and together decided to marry a second wife for reasons that are privy to their couple. It was decided by the couple that the first wife would choose the second and that if the husband and second wife agreed they would marry. They live together and have learned through good and bad times to make a beautiful happy household. Is that the outcome in most polygamous household? Probably not. Is it the outcome in any household? Most probably not. Marriage and living with a spouse are in and of themselves learning processes. So is polygamy. It takes maturity, humility, compassion and love. So does any committed relationship. But if I were a woman, as long as it was done according to the fair and compassionate rules that Allah(exalted be He) has set for us, as long as my God given rights were respected, I’d rather opt for that American brother’s experience rather than the ones so many women have to face alone in some countries. Examples of single abused women having to raise their children all alone abound all over the world and show that their cases are not more desirable than this Saudi sister’s. No matter if some on here would rather be buried alive at birth.</p>
<p><b>Is it a story about abuse?</b></p>
<p>So it’s not Islam, it’s not polygamy. Could it be simply: ABUSE?</p>
<p>I know many a woman of different faith and culture who suffers today the same hardship, abuse and pain this sister had to endure. They are not Muslim nor are they engaged in polygamous unions.I know many couples in Saudi who were forced into the same unhappy arrangements and they didn’t resort to physical violence to take all their frustrations out on their spouse the way this sister’s ex did!</p>
<p>This story is all about ABUSE. First and foremost, before it is a story about Islam and polygamy like many would like it to be. We are taught from a young age, some better than others, how to deal with anger and frustration. Anger and physical violence were certainly never the methodology nor the tools of our beloved Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)! </p>
<p>If you take the violence out of the picture in this story, you’d have the story of a couple who are socially forced to do something that is neither in their heart nor in their faith. They then might have had the wisdom to seat down and figure out a way out of this practice of the time of  pre-Islamic ignorance.Instead we have a man, her ex, who obviously was left to persist in his abuse, ignorance and arrogance towards Allah’s laws. And who will probably repeat the same pattern with others and through his children. And a sister who was given an extra challenge when she met a man of a different faith.</p>
<p>Dear Sister:</p>
<p>My heart goes out to you and all on this planet that endure such injustice and abuse. But know that those same social challenges and worst, our beloved Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and his followers (may Allah be pleased with them all) faced in their time. When Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) stood at the Ka’bah to advocate the Unique One and only Ilah (god), he was going against so much social pressures, so much financial powers and socially powerful people! That our own challenges pale in comparison. Announcing that “la ilaha illallah” meant for people of Makkah the destruction of their idols, their main source of revenue at that time. It would be today the same if someone came up and said: we cannot sale oil anymore! Can you imagine the powerful lobbies that rely on the sales of oil?! It is a similar challenge that our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) faced. And he stood up. And he followed Allah’s commands Who said:</p>
<p><i>Surah 39v37: And whoever Allah guides – for him there is no misleader. Is not Allah Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution?</i><br>
<i>Surah 7v186: Whoever Allah sends astray – there is no guide for him. And He leaves them in their transgression, wandering blindly.</i></p>
<p>It is the same commitment that our beloved Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) made that we need to consider anew, explore, understand and revive in our modern time. It is indeed much easier said than done for me who lives in a different country. But rest assured that we all Muslims have our share of burdens, wherever we stand. And Allah (exalted be He) doesn’t give anyone a burden beyond his ability.<br>
.<br>
This is indeed a great challenge and I hope you will remain fasten to your consciousness of Allah (exalted be He) and his Oneness (tawheed). And I pray that one day your husband  joins you in faith. I pray Allah (exalted be He) that He showers you with His Mercy and Compassion and help you make the right decisions and turn your union with this son of Adam, a blessed one.</p>
<p>It is not a story about Islam. It is not a story about a practice (ie:polygamy).It is a story about a culture and tradition that perpetuates injustices and the power of money and status above Allah’s commands. It is a story about a sister’s challenge in her faith, in her social comfort, in her life.</p>
<p>Respectfully in faith,<br>
bdg</p>

<p>PS: and to be constructive i wiIl ask:</p>
<p>What is the position of lawyers and Qadi in Saudi Arabia regarding the issue? Not everybody in Saudi is like that sister’s ex. A lot are God fearing and many would consider it their duty as this sister’s two brothers did.</p>
<p>Is there a possible recourse as stated by Allah in the Quran for those women or the Saudi system is that locked that no recourse is possible?</p>
<p>To you sister who opened that clinic for battered women, i woIld like you to reflect on the case i meItioned in an earlier comment about the female circumcision in Egypt. It might be a way to find constructive solutions that conform to God’s laws to and provide them with decent help for the future generations.<br>
Female circumcision in Egypt has been an serious issue from times immemorial. At first the only solution it appeared was: “let’s liberate women (meaning, let’s throw in the towel, sorry the Hijab) and become westernized! That ought to work!” Except, it didndidn’tork. Only when some women decided to get constructive and include religious scholars from Al-Azhar and their support against this horrible mutilation did the practice start disappearing from Egyptian traditions.<br>
So what i amImerely suggesting is that maybe the same approach might work? How to approach those Scholars, how to go about that, I’m not sure. But i just thought that considering the Saudi society compared to the Egyptian experience with female genital mutilation, that might be a good suggestion.</p>
<p>Surah III:<br>
102. O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him].<br>
103. And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you – when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided.</p>
<p>I urge you and every sister to go to a local mosque and learn about Allah’s message, so they don’t have to suffer from ignorance again. I urge you sister to keep in touch with sisters in the US at your school or local Masjid. There are great Muslims over there. Although you haven’t benefited from any Islamic established support system in the past, i have personally met some great Muslims in the US ready , willing and eager to help. Sabru miftahul faraj!</p>
<p>Everything right and True is from Allah. Any mistake is from myself. May He forgive me for my deviances, and may He manifest the Truth on your tongue, my dear reader, so that I may accept it.</p>

	<p>Nice post Bruno.  I am not sure anyone here made a claim that causes of the abuse and what she went through were directly caused by Islam.</p>
<p>  What is clear is that the abuse was done by Muslims, in a society that really should be one of the best examples of Islam.</p>
<p>  Her story is not a one off, it is not unusual.  As a matter of fact, it is all too common in many Muslim majority countries.</p>
<p>  Of course many in these countries, many in positions of power within the governments and the religious establishments will arguely that this IS Islam.</p>
<p>  Where culture and religion mix it often becomes VERY hard for those involved to tell the difference.  More importantly, sad to say, many times it becomes irrelevent because for all intents and purposes the misguided cultural traditions and practices become Islam for these people.</p>
<p>  So, to a certain extent, arguing about whether or not these things were Islamic is almost besides the point.  It is an academic discussion about a situation in real life involving violence and abuse that wasnt academic.</p>
<p>  You suggest for the sister to go to a local mosque and learn about Allah’s message, but the problem with that is many mosques will just reinforce the beliefs that lead to this lady’s abuse.</p>
<p>  Maybe you missed Carol’s story about taking one lady suffering abuse to the mosque and the result was to send the lady home to accept the situation and pray.</p>
<p>  That is what will happen at probably the majority of the mosques in the USA, most certainly in a place like Saudi.</p>
<p>  This is where reality meets your academic discussion of what is, and what isnt, Islam.</p>

	<p><b>Abu Sinan:</b><br>
That you decide to consider the point of what is legally pleasing to Allah and what is not “beside the point, is your own calling brother. But as far as I’m concern, it’s not simple academic rhetoric, rambling or propaganda. It is my duty to know those things.</p>
<p>I might have misspoken here when i said: “go to a local mosque and learn about Allah’s message” What i meant is merely getting to be knowledgeable about what is permissible and what is not in Islam. The same way i would advice anyone to have a minimum knowledge about his/her civil rights in the country in which they live. Knowledge is power but it is also a duty for Muslim.</p>
<p>Surah 96v1: 1. Read in the name of your Lord who created (every thing),</p>
<p>It was not clear to me from the interview that this sister gave that she knew about all her rights in Islam before her ordeal.</p>
<p>As to to portray Carol’s story, as “what will happen at probably the majority of the mosques in the USA”  ,  as widespread and common as you think this reaction might be, and God only knows how widespread, it is misleading to give a picture of our American Muslim community so dark and dreary. Nor is it wise.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what is your personal experience of life as a Muslim in the US, but i for once have met great people, of great knowledge and education who were always eager to share whatever they had of knowledge, wisdom and help. You cannot take that from me. </p>
<p>That you decide to dwell on the bad experiences. It is your choice. I just take note of those whining little buggers in my every day life so i know who they are to avoid them and move on to the next best thing. Or next best Muslim in this case. </p>
<p>You can decide to wake up in the morning and smell the coffee or wake up and smell your own fetid breath and do noting about it. Again, your call my man.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

	<p>Thank you Bruno and Abu Sinan for the latest comments. </p>
<p>I would like to interject that the Saudi woman understands her faith and is proud of her faith.  There should be no questions or fingers pointed in that direction. </p>
<p>Bruno I liked the way you broke down the issues of abuse, polygamy, islam. It makes good fodder for thought and reflection in general and the Saudi woman has faced challenges in abuse and polygamy but never at any point is HER faith questioned. </p>
<p>This can also be one of the very sensitive areas where Saudi Arabia is contrast and contradictions.  I’ve no doubt her father, he ex-husband and the other family members who may not accept her now in all likelihood consider themselves good and pious muslims.</p>

	<p>Bruno,</p>
<p>  You missed the point.  No one is arguing what is legal and not legal according to Islam.  I think out of this entire thread of comments you are the only one talking about this really.  Of course, as a Muslim, I care about what is pelasing to Allah, but that ISNT what this is all about really.</p>
<p>  Again, you talk about “getitng to be knowledgebale about what is permissiable or not in Islam” and you miss the point again.  Much of what happened to this lady would have been found to be “permissable” by many Muslim scholars.  THAT is the crux of the situation.  Much of what happens in Muslim societies is passed off as Islam, but isnt.  Guess where it comes from?  It comes from the scholars and leaders of the religion in those countries.</p>
<p>  I didnt give a depiction of our American Muslim community as “dark and dreary” I simply stated facts as I see them.  If you choose to label it “dark and dreary” that is your choice.  The fact that Carol had the same exact experience as someone known to me who was forced to go to the Christian community for help leads me to believe the problem is widespread.  Your issues with me for talking about it shows how hard it is for people in our community to tackle and address these issues.</p>
<p>  I have met great people in the Muslim community as well.  Most of the time, sadly, they were not the leaders of the community.  I dont seek to take anything from you, again that is you putting YOUR thoughts, ideas and words on me.  It just isnt true!  If you have your own mind and experiences, how can anything I say take anything from you?</p>
<p>  I dont dwell on bad experiences, but what other experiences would you want to talk about in a post like this?  Dont dwell on bad experiences, sure, but dont ignore them, dont sweep them under the rug and dont act like they dont exist either!</p>
<p>  As to talking about “fetid breath” I suggest you stop the insults.  How does the elevate the conversation?  Is that would a proper Muslim should do?  Nowhere have I insulted you.  My nasee7a to you, brother, would be to mind your manners as Allah is watching.</p>
<p>  @Carol,</p>
<p>  I think you’ll find her faith IS being questioned.  One person did so very openly at the begining of the comments.  Other comments are pushing in that direction without being as open about it.</p>

	<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>This is my story, i didn’t want to comment so thanks to Ms.carol for posting my comments  Thanks for your well wishes. this is a public forum so i accept all negative and positive comments, but i think i should clarify some.</p>
<p>I don’t say all this happened because of Islam, I know what Iam today is because of the all merciful adn all compassionate , My faith helped in bringing me out of these difficulties and islam is the most beautiful religion . i do however blame the culture of saudi for my plaight dn also the culture of my family , and since the culture of saudi is so tied to islam i think it portrays islam bad, my intention is never that. I place blame on saudi to a big extent and their laws.</p>
<p>let me say to some comments, polygamy is not bad, may work for some and who am i to make haram what is permitted however it does not work for me and islam tells me i have free choice to decide, but could ! in Saudi ? no.<br>
next is  marriage , I was 18 wanting to continue my studies , but family decided for this marriage and so i aoppose and then what? go where? support myself how?  who will give me job? who will be my guardian? tell me. so actually i have no choice.<br>
third the abuse – again same questions, I have gome to my brother and masjid and also older mmbers in both families, why do they say it’s allah’s will. Why i have to pray to bear the abuse? at that time i don’t know any better, but now i ask should i not pray for better life and to be a good person instead.</p>
<p>so no this is not islam, it’s some strange thing that the saudi top people pass off as islam. </p>
<p>see i have lived in only 3 countries so i compare between the 3 , now i live here free and free also to practise my islam. the ummah is supportive but some frown upon how i left my old marriage, again polygamy is not bad but to me it is. to my mother it was, that is all i have to go by. Why cannot i be happy,loved and treated well in saudi. i’m not saying saudi is all bad, it is my birthplace and my comfort, but it has bad too and we should somehow correct that. </p>
<p>see one wise lady counselled me and she  told me “hold on to your faith and trust in god that even when times are bad, then only can you come out and heal”. and she is not even Muslim . i apologize for long comment and taking up space and i will stop thank you Ms. carol and for others i have no intention to hurt anyone, i’m happy now and hope and pray everyone will be happy.</p>

	<p>Maybe some commentors made comments questioning the faith of the Saudi woman.  However she knows who she is AND she has a strong faith.  Commentors can say what they want but when it comes down to it, the one who really matters in regards to faith is the individual and their God.  After all, whose the final judge?</p>

<p>Many thanks for choosing to respond directly to comments. You are indeed a very strong and beautiful woman and stronger now because of the challenges and suffering you had endured.

	<p>@Anonymous,</p>
<p>  Thanks for commenting.  Some, for all of their devotion to Islam and monotheism, would like to set themselves up as God and pass judgement upon everyone else!</p>
<p>  I might not agree with everything you’ve done, but I understand what would make you choose what you did.  More to the point, the fact that your husband is Christian is only a slight blip to these people anyways.  I am an American convert to Islam married to a Saudi lady and I dare say our treatment in the community often isnt any better.</p>
<p>  Instead of attacking a lady like this, the community would be better off looking at themselves and addressing the serious shortfallings in the community incidents like this point out.  More’s the pity that it wont happen because it is much to hard to look within ourselves and make a change.  It is much easier to sit back and point at people, quote this scholar or that.</p>
<p>  @Lynn,</p>
<p>  My issue has ALWAYS been with the cultures that surround much of Islam, not with Islam itself.</p>

	<p>Uh oh…muna just opened a pandoras box in the muslim community. </p>
<p>According to most muslims and a majority of muslim scholars….no…female muslims cannot marry non muslim men…according to the Quran and historical records…yes…muslim women can marry ahl al kitab.. People (or men) from the Books…the Books being the Torah and Bible…so depends on who you prefer to get your teachings from…scholars (who base much of their work on Arab cultural beliefs…one of which is that an Arab woman cannot marry a non arab man…many arab countries to this day still hold to this belief…and a an arab woman must gain special permission to marry a nonarab man…and her children are NOT considered arab and cannot easily obtain their mothers nationality…all though an arab man married to a non arab womans children are considered arab and easily obtain  their fathers nationality)  and muslims..or God and the prophet? </p>
<p>Easy enough concept to understand with just a tiny bit of research…most dont bother and just assume all is kosher about muslim men being able to pick and choose from the religious buffet table of women when it comes to marriage…but muslim women must restrict themselves to a meager meal of just muslim men. All depends on whether you believe God is Most Fair and Most Just…or completely bian towards Muslim men. </p>
<p>So say I.</p>

	<p>I’m rather suspicious of this. The “interviewee” misuses the phrase “inshaallah” to refer to an event that already occurred (“I could not have done this without  my brother’s family Insha’Allah.”).<br>
She also referred to herself as a “hijabi” which is a made-up word used by American and British converts.<br>
And she calls Saudia “The Kingdom,” not the norm among actual Saudis speaking English.<br>
There are dozens of other suspicious phrases throughout both parts.<br>
Frankly, I think you made the whole thing up, or at least took great liberties with what was actually said.</p>

	<p>Coolred, I remember reading the same stories, how amongs the first muslims women married men from ”the book. Another instance of ”innovation”!</p>
<p>I cannot believe that a God of Love can let people fall in love and then deny them marriage. It just doesn’t compute. It sounds far more like men wanting to keep their ”posessions”.</p>
<p>Rania, it is very sad, but to those who are or have been married to a muslim man, or who have friends married to muslim men, this story, however sad and unfair and horrible, is only too familiar.<br>
It is only one of a myriad of shared experiences about the suffering and neglect of women in muslim marriages.</p>
<p>Maybe you prefer to denounce this story as make believe because it makes you feel safer, more secure: by denying the truthfulness you deny the possibillity of it happening to you. But for women there is no safety, no security, no protection in Islam.<br>
May you never have to endure the same.</p>

	<p>Aafke,<br>
I would be the last to ever deny that many women married Muslim men, especially those living in Arab and South Asian states, are very often mistreated, with men and their corrupt scholars excusing it all by misusing religion.<br>
That the story itself is all too common is undeniable. This particular narrative, however, does not ring true, mostly because of the language employed.<br>
As for your statement, “But for women there is no safety, no security, no protection in Islam,” you are misinformed. In men, in scholars, in patriarchal states, there is no security for women. In Islam itself, however, there are plenty of protections and the men who misuse our religion in order to do foul things to women will answer to their Maker.</p>

	<p>Rania, there is the <em>theoretical possibillity</em> in the Islamic teachings of protecting women. However, there are also a lot of quotations which can be used to supress women. </p>
<p>When we leave the realm of theory, and look at what’s happening in the <em>real</em> world, the majority of muslims and certainly the muslim countries and their laws, choose <em>not</em> to protect women, but instead supress, terrorise and abuse women in the most heinous ways, from denying them rights as sentient individuals, as in KSA, to condoning ”honour”-killings of women on the most spurious accusations which we see wherever in the world muslims communities have settled.<br>
Hence I cannot but conclude that Islam, as it is practised today, offers no protection in any part of life for women.</p>

	<p>One thing is clear, men who misuse islam to do foul things to women are certainly not held to account in this world.<br>
Meanwhile the women are being told it’s all their fault anyway and they should pray for forgiveness for thei mistakes….<br>
Yeah, duuuhhh.<br>
It would be better if women were saved from their tormentors in this world, <em>right now</em>, rather than have to wait until their tormenters have finally died. If they live longer, let’s not forget a lot of abusing men end up killing their wives. And nobody will hold them accountable for it in <em>this wordl</em> either.  Waiting for the bastards to die will give them many more years of time to commit many more evil foul deeds.</p>
<p>Doesn’t sound a good or even reasonable course of action to me.</p>

	<p><b>First to our dear anonymous sister:</b><br>
I reiterate what I have said in a private correspondence to our host Carol. Although she assured me that I wasn’t the one you had in mind when you made your last comment, I want to make sure you know it was never my intention to hurt or attack you in any way or form. Nor did I have any intention to question your faith. And that’s why I took a couple of days to choose my words carefully before I wrote. I swear that at every word, my main concern was to manage your sensitivity and emotions above all.</p>
<p><b>This said, to All:</b><br>
Although I provided web links in my previous comment of just one example among a plethora of <b>learned and recognized</b> Islamic Scholars, and I stress on learned and recognized (I’m not talking about the local Imam who learned the Quran by heart at age 10), at Al-Azhar U, Medina Islamic U or Makkah , some on here are bent on focusing on the latter kind. They would like you to take those Imams’ opinions as main stream among the over 1.2 Billion Muslims worldwide. Allah’s injunctions and our beloved Prophet’s position on the treatment and the rights of women are clear and our community of learned scholars are unanimous about that. </p>
<p><b>NEITHER</b> the majority of those 1.2 Billion Muslims, <b>NOR the majority of Islamic Scholars</b> think or behave like this lady’s ex husband. So for the eternal whiner and somber heart on here: stop incessantly dwelling on the flaws of a few that leads to this overall impression and feeling that this is accepted behavior and the norm in most of the Islamic Communities worldwide.This is not the case! It never was! And never will! Be it in Saudi, in China, in the US, in Africa or in Asia.</p>
<p>The fact that a few use those uneducated imams to further their own deviant attitude and behavior should not distract the community from its real goal, mission and duties towards women, but also towards mankind. Nor should it distract us from the right constructive attitude: finding positive solutions that work and benefit all of us. Solutions that provide abused women with shelter, work and security. Solutions that mend relationships. Solutions that hold men accountable for they wretched attitude and practice.</p>
<p>I for once have provided the beginning of a constructive reflection, if not solution, by mentioning the case of female genitalia mutilation in Egypt. As I said, the solution in Egypt was to embark scholars from Al-Azhar on a campaign against the barbaric practice. And soon politicians and social workers followed suit.  I could also mention the case of the UAE. They too have been working hard on the same issue. In concert with religious and law enforcement authorities they were able to achieve great successes. Rest assured that examples of good and successful reforms abound in the Muslim Global Community.</p>
<p>As many deviant and evil people as there might be in the Kingdom (and I know now that some on here with hidden agendas love to dwell on those ones ), I know there are also a greater number of sincere, good hearted, God fearing people. Be it in the general population or in the sphere of government and religious authorities. And they too yield great knowledge and powers. Those people’s resources need be tapped. The King himself for example has been working hard on reforming the Mutaween. But the whiners will certainly not dwell on that and other reforms though!</p>
<p>In this post, I still have to read any comment on the idea I put forward. I still have to read constructive criticism and solutions. All all we got so far is repetitive whining, complaining and sobbing from people (always the same) bent on focusing on what’s wrong! All we got are people telling us how horrible this is! How inhuman! Oh! Really? I didn’t know it until you wrote your comments!!</p>
<p>Why am I the only one on here to mention those great examples all over the  Muslim world, be it in Egypt or in the UAE? Why is it that when it comes to Islam, Arabs or the Middle East, all we hear about is only whining and ranting from the same people? Why is it never constructive , original solutions? Why is it always those same heart wrenching sad sobbing stories instead of the great advances and progress all over the Muslim Ummah we could emulate? </p>
<p>Where are the solutions to provide those women who would like to escape their jailers? How do we go about embarking the Saudi establishment on these issues and potential solutions? I asked, and ask again the questions: could the same solution be implemented in Saudi Arabia? Is access to those Scholars easy for women in Saudi? Or would Saudi women have to pass through those scholars’ wives?  </p>
<p>Those are the crucial questions. Those are the real questions. And unless people get constructive, this sad story will remain what it is: a sad sobbing story potentially good enough for a sequel of “Not Without My Daughter”!</p>
<p>If some Muslim brothers and sisters want to help, and if non-Muslim want to join in the fight, the more, the better. For the benefit of Saudi Arabia. For the benefit of Mankind. But it will have to be based on Islamic teachings and methodologies to be efficient, productive and lead to true reform. Not that media hyped and romanticized narrative only meant for people who indulge in self-pity, the Young and the Restless and a few tears because it makes them feel alive!</p>

	<p>Bruno, would you have issues with a Public Service campaign in place that addressed these problems that had television airtime, advertsing space on billboards or newspapers or magazines or anywhere where the population could see it. That way if there was a woman being abused she, and her abuser could both see that what is happening to her is NOT acceptable?</p>

	<p>I recall some pertaining to conserving water but cannot say recently due to our brief sojourn in the States.  You’re right…PSA’s can make a significant impact.</p>

	<p>The only sort of announcements your likely t o see concerning families etc are conserving electricity, water and whatever shopping extravaganza is going on at the moment. Having spent 23 years in Bahrain…its only recently that abuse within families even made it into the newspapers..much less was a place provided that victims could seek help.</p>

	<p><b>Lynn:</b><br>
Why would I be against it? PSAs have always been a great tool in fostering public awareness in every country! Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be an exception. To my knowledge, there is absolutely nothing against God in that! On the contrary. It would help lower the skyrocketing number of divorces and dysfunctional families in the Kingdom. Any threat to the family unit, is a threat to the future of the Ummah. It is a threat to the stability of the country.</p>
<p>But the question remains: how do you embark the religious establishment on the project? I doubt any project would work without their full cooperation and participation. Maybe by convincing them that domestic violence is indeed a direct threat to the Ummah? <i>Any threat to the family unit, is a threat to the future of the Ummah. It is a threat to the stability of the country.</i> Come to think of it, it might be a good slogan for the Kingdom’s campaign?</p>
<p>Also, to illustrate the steps taken towards progress in Saudi Arabia, and other parts of the Muslim Ummah here are a few articles worth reading:</p>
<p><b>For those still bent on portraying the Kingdom as a place where nothing happens, where no progress is ever made:</b><br>
<a href="http://www.arabnews.com/?article=43000" rel="nofollow">Rania Al-Baz Lashes Out at Abuse of Women</a><br>
This was an earth shattering event in Saudi Arabia but all over the world too. It was a big break in bringing people to talk about it. Have we seen progress since? I don’t live in the Kingdom, and am not familiar with the daily lives of Saudis to answer that question. But this story aired on Saudi public TV and in the national press, was without any doubt a great breakthrough. And it proves that, contrary to what some ill intentioned people would like you to believe, change is coming to Saudi Arabia too. Maybe not at the pace some would like. But change has definitely been coming there too.</p>
<p><b>Now for those foul mouthed ones on here who persist on portraying Islam as a religion of oppression and misogyny:</b><br>
<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/09/24/cnnheroes.robina.niaz/index.html" rel="nofollow">Her ‘duty’ is helping Muslim women heal after abuse</a><br>
As Lynn mentioned earlier,this article appeared on CNNHeroes. It’s about an other Muslim woman victim of domestic violence who was put in contact with Robina Niaz, whose organization, <a href="http://turningpoint-ny.org/" rel="nofollow">Turning Point for Women and Families</a>, helps female Muslim abuse victims.</p>
<p>A devout Muslim, Niaz stresses that <b>there is no evidence that domestic violence is more common among Muslim families.</b> “Abuse happens everywhere,” said Niaz. “It cuts across barriers of race, religion, culture.”<br>
This should set the record straight.</p>
<p>Peace<br>

	<p>@Rania-DITTO!!!-hmm???</p>
<p>Anyone want to hear my version of A Western Woman, ok to be more specific – An American Christian Woman Shares Her Experience” Here’s a sneak peak- part 1 of 1000. here we go…</p>
<p>Woman meets man in night club, sleeps with him on the first night, nine months later a fatherless child is born…poor child, sees her daddy only on weekends, birthdays and holidays…mom continues to date and sleeps with different  men on a regular basis…sometimes there’s physical, mental, emotional and sexual abuse.<br>
…there are two other siblings, all with different fathers…mom’s not sure who the daddy is for one…however no one intervenes because this is “NORMAL”…to be continued…<br>
for those of you who want to hear the rest of the story I’ll be happy to go on…</p>
<p>@lynn- “So if I see injustice being done to women and children, I have to speak up. It’s my duty.’<br>
Then u should start with your country first, where there are way more injustices being done to women<br>
Women are abused physically, and sexually in ur part of the world on a daily basis,, what r u doing to help as part of your god given ‘duty’?</p>

	<p>Um Zayna, What you don’t seem to understand is that I, personally, don’t really have to do anything except maybe support the local women’s shelter. Because, you see, my government has already made the laws and the people are not at all confused about whether or not it is legal to beat your wife. </p>
<p>Also, if you had seen the crying Indian PSA that I mentioned you would be very clear that he was upset that his beautiful country was ruined with garbage. I hear the Middle East is a garbage pit that could use a PSA like this one. </p>

	<p>Bruno,<br>
So you don’t think that a PSA would be talking about it too much? You aren’t afraid that it would leave the women to think that the next step would be to start  acting all Westernised, first with their clothing and then with drinking alcohol and eventually sleeping around so that they don’t even know who the father of their children is?  .</p>
<p>Do you think it would be very difficult to get a religious authority to approve of such a thing as a PSA against domestic violence? I couldn’t imagine that it would be an issue. If it is, then one would have to say that there was something wrong with the religion, wouldn’t they? So, that’s not a worry.</p>

Now you’re revealing your true colors! You’re so transparent! Contrary to others on here, a little more subtle and smart about it, you don’t even hide anymore. You just blurt things out.</p>
<p><i> You aren’t afraid that it would leave the women to think that the next step would be to start acting all Westernised, first with their clothing and then with drinking alcohol and eventually sleeping around…..</i></p>
<p>Why would a clean, well thought out, innocent powerful PSA about domestic violence lead to such insane thoughts?This is such a bizarre stretch of your wicked imagination! Or are you just a plain innocent drama queen? Either way, you sure belong in Hollywood, not holly land with those thoughts!</p>
<p>Oh but wait, you again:<br>
<i> then one would have to say that there was something wrong with the religion, wouldn’t they?</i></p>
<p>The tone, the choice of words, the phrasing, all betray your own ill intent or your youth!? Of course it is Islam the culprit! How could i have missed it! </p>

	<p>Bruno, I just thought that maybe you would think that it was just too much whining about the same ole like you said above: ‘All all we got so far is repetitive whining, complaining and sobbing from people (always the same) bent on focusing on what’s wrong! All we got are people telling us how horrible this is! How inhuman!’</p>
<p>You also said: ‘Female circumcision in Egypt has been an serious issue from times immemorial. At first the only solution it appeared was: “let’s liberate women (meaning, let’s throw in the towel, sorry the Hijab) and become westernized! That ought to work!”  </p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I ALWAYS show my true colors. But remember, we have a language barrier between us or some thing. See, what you might think is my ‘agenda’ might actually say more about you than it does me. I don’t have an ‘agenda’ but you seem to be on a mission here. You need to relax and maybe take your own advice and instead of whining that people have the wrong impression of Islam YOU can do something to get some PSAs together and out to the Muslim world. </p>
<p>You are absolutely right that it is only hearsay that I know of the garbage strewn about in the Middle East. If only those bloggers would just STOP telling it like it is! </p>
<p>Backbiter and a slanderer? LOLOLOL I’m sorry Bruno but that just sounds funny to me.</p>

	<p><b>Umm Zayna:</b></p>
<p><i>“An American Christian Woman Shares Her Experience”</i></p>
<p>Although you made a great point and i think it was a very powerful one, I think that the national or religious characterization of the woman was uncalled for.<br>
It removes some power to your narrative and makes the whole argument belligerent. It might be what ticked off our dear Lynn after all?! Not that i really care about Lynn’s own wicked emotions. But out of respect for people of the Christian faith or Americans of all faiths who might not be as wicked as the woman you describe, i find this type of characterization unnecessary.</p>
<p>Indeed the woman you describe could actually be from any country and any religion. There are unfortunately Jewish and also Muslim women that lead the same life style. And in a not so distant past, Christian women in Europe and all over the world used to dress modestly. Although not wearing the full traditional veil you find in some Muslim countries, they wore a scarf on their head and always loose long fitted clothes. Some Christian women in many part of the world still dress very modestly.</p>
<p>So it’s not a nationality nor a faith that is at fault here. It is the mind set that leads to this “liberated” state that needs be exposed. Whatever they have in mind when they want to “liberate” you!</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br>

	<p>‘It might be what ticked off our dear Lynn after all?! Not that i really care about Lynn’s own wicked emotions’</p>
<p>Lynn was ticked off? LOL Too funny! Where did you even get that idea? The only person that seemed upset here was you and umm Zayna(obviously) because you guys are of the ones that can’t tolerate hearing and/or admitting that there is anything that might need to be changed in the Arab/Muslim world. It’s a shame and it tells a LOT about why it is still the way it is. Not MY problem since live in the decadent west where I’m free to sleep with, marry or divorce whom ever I want to, when ever I want to. If you guys could just get past the fact that there CAN be decent, intelligent people who are not Muslim and do not buy your belief that Islam has the answer for everything and just co-exist with them rather than think that they must have some hidden agenda to bring down the Islamic World! You need to have more faith that your religion can withstand hearing the truth about the evils that are happening within it whether the evil is done In the name of Islam or just because ignorant Muslims happened to do it.</p>
<p>What good does it do you to come on here and complain that this story is just Islam bashing and should not be told or put all kinds of caveats in place for ‘how’ these stories should be told or who should tell them? Even if this woman was the only woman that this has ever happened to her story should STILL be told and people should be listening to her story and trying to figure out how to ensure that it NEVER happens to another woman again rather than getting into judgemental arguments about ‘faith’.</p>

<p>You should have good thoughts about your Muslim brothers and sisters especially on an open forum. When they say something you do not like, interpret their words in such a way that reflects best on their character. </p>
<p>The west is used as the yard stick for what a society should be and everything that happens in Muslim countries are expose and reported to show how horrible Muslims are. </p>
<p>When the Kufaar publish these Posts/reports you should be sceptical These type of false flag operations are part of their methodology and they are designed to win the hearts and minds of the Muslims, and to spread false ideologies about Islam in general.</p>

	<p>Whether or not Islam itself condones abuse of women, non muslims, non arabs is beside the point….its the people…the Muslims and the Arabs (who basically set the standard of what Muslims are…so to speak) who proclaim to the world what Islam is merely by practicing and condoning certain actions…and THEY themselves claim that is Islam…so what are we to believe then?</p>
<p>23 years living in the Middle East I have lost count of the arguments I have had with Muslim/Arabs over what constitutes Islam and what constitutes culture….if they themselves cant seem to tell the difference…the average layperson has quite a job in front of them separating the two.</p>
<p>Getting on a blog and kicking a** and claiming we are jumping to conclusions or generalizing is just crap because we are “jumping” to those conclusion based on YOUR practices and beliefs…which YOU (general you) claim is Islam. Arent Muslims the ones that are supposed to make that distinction…not nonMuslims?</p>
<p>btw before you ask…yes Im Muslim too…but I do not believe culture is Islam…so do not claim to be one of YOU (general you)….i.e. cultural Muslim.</p>
<p>Also…if the country’s govt itself allows much of this practice of abuse (unfair divorce laws, child custody laws, allows child marriages etc) and calls itself an Islamic run govt…then again…what are we to assume? The country  claims they are following the Quran and govern themselves under Sharia Law…and then condone abusive actions…so once again we are left to assume (based on Muslim actions) that that is Islamically correct belief and behavoir. </p>
<p>It is NOT the job of nonMuslims to sort this mess out and do all the hard work when it comes to acknowledging what IS and what ISNT Islam…its the job of Muslims…pure and simple.</p>

	<p>coolred, excellent comment, exactely the point I tried to make.<br>
It’s the muslims who claim they lead the muslim life, follow the quran, and then treat women like dirt and tell them it’s their own fault as well.</p>
<p>Sure some christians do the same, and if this were a christian blog I’d share the same comments but with a christian twist. </p>
<p>However, as this blog is about Saudi Arabia, the comments of those who can think clearly are geared towards KSA and in this case it’s twisted interpretation of Islam. This woman’s story, horrific as it is seems all too common.<br>
Like coolred said: If all muslims claim they follow Islam, and Saudies like to claim they follow it better than everybody else, then Islam sucks if you have the bad luck of being a woman.</p>
<p>So sorry apologists: If I listen to you only then Islam sucks.</p>
<p>It’s actually the intelligent independant thinkers and muslims on this blog, whom Bruno and Umm Zayna so dislike, who actually swing the balance of Islam more favorably in a positive direction. It is the intelligent <em>thinking</em> people who are able to distinguish between stone-age tribal customs and Islam.<br>
And they seem to be pretty rare.</p>
<p>Only to be shouted down again by the bigots who keep trying to convince us that Islam is an intolerant, misogynist and bigotted religion.</p>

	<p>@Umm Zayna: ‘You should have good thoughts about your Muslim brothers and sisters especially on an open forum. When they say something you do not like, interpret their words in such a way that reflects best on their character.’</p>
<p>Seriously? You really don’t see the problem with that statement? Especially in the context of this post? It might sound all flowery and sweet and peaceful but it also has the very detrimental effect of ignoring the problems that affect your ummah! You need to get away from that mindset that tells you not to air your dirty laundry in case someone finds out that you are humans whose clothes get dirty!</p>

	<p><b> Umm Zayna:</b><br>
You definitely make an excellent point and i’m sincerely sorry if i offended you or you felt in any way the target of a direct unbrotherly criticism. It was not my intent.</p>
<p>I was merely referring to some discussion technique that might be able to convey the same point without offending innocent people who are also genuinely looking for the truth. Our beloved Prophet was at time harsh and at times very soft and gentle. Even with our most determined ruthless enemies. It is our duty to emulate him and learn when is a time for belligerence and when is a time for compassion.</p>
<p>But this discussion goes now beyond what i consider the main issue of this post. So out of respect for the host and for the readers I will make this my last comment on this post.</p>
<p><b>Abu Abdullah:</b><br>
Thank you for the nice reminder. It is indeed a useful one.</p>

	<p>Bruno,<br>
Since you decided not to comment again on this post by the time I got round to responding to you, I’ll just say the main points.</p>
<p>I had already said KSA wasn’t following the Islamic law in matters of marriage, so you didn’t say anything new in your comment in that matter – you just used different words.</p>
<p>Yes, polygamy has everything to do with Islam – it is sanctioned there, Prophet Muhammad himself practised it and therefore, he is the role model for many Muslim men, who are supported by the positive injunction in favour of it. True, it also existed in many other traditional societies, but a lot of them are no longer following it and this post is about KSA so we are not discussing other societies here.</p>
<p>About whether the issue to be questioned is polygamy or abuse – just because you know few stray cases of women living “happily” (though I doubt if that’s not a mask before the world) in polygamy doesn’t mean that most women would be happy with it and therefore it should be sanctioned. Majority of women do not want it. Besides, there is no point in dissociating polygamy from abuse – POLYGAMY ITSELF IS ABUSE OF WOMEN. It works on the principle of devaluation of women, therefore it’s abuse. And therefore it is atrocious by standads of all cultures – no matter whether it has the religious or legal sanction anywhere in the world or not. There is no point in saying polygamy is alright as long as there is no abuse – it is not alright and polygamy itself is abuse.</p>
<p>In your remarks I’ve been noticing a tendency to romanticise Islam and the KSA. For whatever reasons you’ve chosen to relate to Islam and you simply don’t want to look at Islam or the KSA from a rational perspective. Islam is a religion like so many other religions in the world and KSA is a country like so many other countries in the world, so there is no need to romanticise them – they have their positive and negative aspects like any other religion/country. So if you truly wish the best for KSA and for Islamic communities, you should appreciate the positive factors and suggest constructive criticisms for the negative aspects, rather than trying to defend the indefensible. And I’m sure you have the intellect to suggest constructive criticisms. As I’ve said elsewhere, self-criticism is the most constructive criticism and the ills of any religion and culture have to be set right by the people of that religion and culture – they have to recognise first that ills exist there, only then they can set them right.</p>

	<p>@Daisy:<br>
“POLYGAMY ITSELF IS ABUSE OF WOMEN”<br>
Well its not if done with all the partners concerned are in agreement and happy about it.</p>
<p>Well though Polygamy may be considered Abuse in other cultures, in Islaam it is not. </p>
<p>And for practicing muslims to criticize polygamy under the context of Islaam, well we would never condemn and in turn condemn those who condemn it. But again if Polygamous marriage fails to gurantee the rights of a wife then yeah we would condemn it.</p>
<p>Well about the Polygamous issue usually the criticisms are because of the mentality of non-conformity. For example i would say “Dogs are yuck” thats my personal belief, but if i see Dogs being eaten in Korea i can’t and cannot say “Koreans are yuck”. What works for you and some women may not necessarily work for the women everywhere.</p>
<p>Any ways check this latest article on Polygamy,<br>

	<p>I will go one step further Daisy and say that Polygamy itself is abuse of women AND HER CHILDREN!!</p>
<p>For those who want to say that polygamy can be a good thing I will say it can be looked at as alcohol was in Islam. First it was ok but just don’t go to prayers drunk, then God, in all his wisdom (but obvious lack of forethought), noticed that it wasn’t being used responsibly so it was banned completely. So, polygamy was bad, so God in all his wisdom put limits on it but it is STILL bad for the wives AND the children. Why could he not have banned it completely like he did alcohol? Not everyone who drinks alcohol drinks it irresponsibly and alcohol has been proven time and time again to have health BENEFITS.  Could it be because MEN didn’t want polygamy changed and they can get by with home brew?</p>

	<p>Actually, the polygamy question is a lot more complicated than it seems. Most people I know do not concern themselves with these intricacies.</p>
<p>Let us look at the original verse.</p>
<p>Yusuf Ali (obviously, many others exist):</p>
<p>[004:003]  If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice. </p>
<p>Why is there a conditional connection between fair treatment of orphans and marriage, including polygamous marriage?</p>
<p>To simplify:</p>
<p>Why would a married man (to one or more) treat orphans better than a single man? And what specific bad treatment is alleged here?</p>
<p>There is a theory that says, men would be more inclined to take care of orphans if they were married to their mothers.  Combined with a context in which the verse was revealed (after a major battle), it seems that this interpretation says to men – take care of the orphans, and if you cannot be bothered to take care of random children, then marry their mothers, in which case you will be legally obligated to take care of these children. </p>
<p>Then you have a different translation that says the following:</p>
<p>Muhammad Al-Hilali &amp; Muhsin Khan:</p>
<p>[004:003]  And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice. </p>
<p>The orphans becoming “orphan girls” certainly throws an interesting twist into the logic if…/then.  What specific injustice toward the orphan girls is assumed here that can be remedied by marrying? </p>
<p>One explanation says, really, it’s all the benjamins.  This is about making sure that orphans girls are not disadvantaged when they marry – in a financial sense.  </p>
<p>There is apparently a whole collection of stories where Aisha advances that point of view <a href="http://www.wikiislam.com/wiki/Dealing_Justly_with_Wives_and_Orphans" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikiislam.com/wiki/Dealing_Justly_with_Wives_and_Orphans</a>.  In a nutshell, it says, if you are taking care of an orphan girl (who has money), and are inclined to marry her on conditions that are less advantageous than you would offer to any other woman – because she’s an orphan and has no one to negotiate on her behalf – then go marry someone else.</p>
<p>This may or may not make sense, but in both cases, it seems that multiple wives is a moot issue for men who have no orphans in their care. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any more alternative explanations?</p>
<p>My point is, this prescription is a lot more complicated than it appears.  Even Muhammad Asad, who usually makes sense, does not provide an exhaustive explanation of this point, merely demurring that multiple interpretations exist:<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/masad02/004" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/masad02/004</a>  </p>
<p>What do people think?</p>

	<p>I think that polygamy isn’t allowed in Islam, That  famous sura about four wives was from right after the battle of Uhud, a time when many muslim men were killed and many widows and orphans were left without protection.</p>
<p>After all the sura finishes with the line that yoiu can only take more wives if you can treat them absolutely equally.</p>
<p>And ends with: but you will never be able to do so.</p>
<p>So in effect, as men are not capable of marrying multiple wives, <em>and</em> treating them absolutely equal, there can be no justification of doing so.</p>
<p>And  if Islam were actually followed, instead of stone-age culture, then even the Saudies would have to admit that women can choose not to share their husband with other wives; the prophet did not wish for his daughter Fatima to become a co-wife, and his granddaughter had it written in her marriage contract.</p>
<p>So really besides polygamy being silly because the natural numbers of men and women are about equal, and cruel to women and the children, there is the evidence in the Quran, and the example of the prophet and his granddaughter to stop it.</p>

	<p>NN</p>
<p>I agree…the WHOLE point of polygamy in Islam was to protect ORPHANS and WIDOWS….not just so Muslim men could try out something new…get something younger…have more kids…or whatever other nonsense or excuse he can come up with. If Muslim men are NOT marrying to protect orphans and or widows…then they are NOT following the requirements laid out by God…and therefore are NOT acting according to Islamic precepts.</p>
<p>So say I.</p>

	<p>Lynn,<br>
I completely agree with you – polygamy is abuse of women and children.</p>
<p>NN,<br>
Thanks for that interpretation. I knew about taking widows in times of war as second wives as allowed, but I didn’t know about orphans.</p>
<p>Aafke,<br>
Thanks for that excellent interpretation of polygamy in Islam. I knew about the equal treatment part, but I didn’t know the verse ended with “But you’ll never be able to do so.”</p>
<p>Abu Abdullah,<br>
The point is that the women are never happy about it, at best they project a mask of “happiness” to the world because they are so dependent upon their husbands for everything and dare not defy him. So no point in arguing that it’s alright if all parties are “happy.”</p>
<p>Besides, if we go by Aaafke’s interpretation of that verse, polygamy is not allowed in Islam and quite obviously men are using it to their undue advantage because they know the women can’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>Even going by NN’s interpretation, it was never meant as a common practice but allowed only under extreme circumstances of contingencies. And it talks about circumstances of war widows and orphans at a certain moment in history when widows didn’t have any other means to live if they were not associated with a man as their protector. In today’s context, when war widows can have so many other options to survive if only the State allowed them those venues of survival – and get married as well if they like – it doesn’t make sense to use this verse as a justification for polygamy as common practice. As for orphans, in today’s context, every well-thinking nation and its civil society should have a responsibility towards their education and maintenance.</p>
<p>About polygamy being a personal preference in certain cultures/religions – You are absolutely right that all cultures and religions have their own worldviews and normally one shouldn’t judge others by one’s own worldview – and no one understands this better than me, since I deal with many cultures and religions. But one has to make a distinction. There are many practices in others’ cultures and religions that have to be taken in a positive light by others even if they appear strange or unintelligible from one’s own standpoint. However, there are certain issues that are non-negotiable on the basis of cultural/religious differences. Child abuse, molestation of an unprotected woman, punishment of rape victims, honour killing, restrictions placed on freedom of choice of the people by the State and polygamy are a few of the issues that are non-negotiable – no matter in which culture or religion they exist and no matter whether they have a legal or religious sanction. I can  cite few examples – in many ancient societies, the many wives, servants, officials of a king were buried alive when the king died. There are archaeological evidences of such mass burials. This was accepted in those societies, the people who went to grave projected a mask of being “happy” as you say and it was the cultural norm of that era. But with time it was realised that this wasn’t a humane practice and it disappeared over time. Slavery in ancient times is another good example, which was considered a cultural norm but it disappeared over time because gradually the world realised it wasn’t a humane practice. In the same way, today’s world has to identify the practices that can not be sanctioned on the basis of cultural/religious norms and polygamy is one such example.</p>

	<p>Today with regards to polygamy we have two types of extremists…</p>
<p>The right side is not content with 4 but believes in subtracting 1 and adding 1 frequently maintaining the tally of 4 but cumulatively exceeding 10 or more sometimes. And does not believe in the happiness of the wifes and kids of all. And also at times sees the institution of marriage from a Carnal pleasure point of view… These people fail to see that Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions though practiced polygamy, they were never an example of a unhappy family or spouse hating. </p>
<p>The other left goes away from the established easy to read, literal reading of the Quraan and Hadeeth to construed meanings and notions as if they had been the students of Islaam for decades (mind you i am not advocating the clergy here but just literal reading of the Quraan and Hadeeth). And as if they have gotten into the minds of all women decide that all women and children were or are unhappy. Yeah Polygamous marriages does lead to unhappy families in certain cases, so does the monogomous marriages.</p>
<p>“Based on a 1995 federal study by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), one-third of marriages between young people will end in divorce within the first 10 years and 43 percent in the first 15 years.” — American Chronicle (<a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/98110" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/98110</a>)</p>
<p>Now 43% Divorces!!!!!! Monogamous Divorces!!!! (as of 1995)</p>
<p>Well i would say based on the statistics and hard evidence available i don’t see how Monogamous marriages are different than Polygamous Marriages. </p>
<p>However i will agree that if a husband takes in a another wife secretly or without the consent of his other wife then yeah breaks ups and tearing will occur.</p>
<p>However for muslims we still hold the cultures and practices of the Prophet (PBUH) valid even today. So there is no way a learned muslim (not referring to Clergy) would ever shun or criticize. Now i understand that some non-muslims or even muslims would not be ok with this, well its your choice and this choice is ours… I do not see how following the Quraan and Sunnah word by word literally stops me from being successfull today. I have seen it, done it without consequences so have many others.</p>
<p>For once atleast lets discuss this issue with facts, and figures statistically instead of conveying your personal emotions or feelings. So lets agree to disagree..</p>

	<p>These are not any one person’s emotions or feelings. Majority of women do feel this way and I completely understand if the men do not understand why the women feel this way or if the men don’t even want to acknowledge that the women feel this way – they wouldn’t give up their unequal priviledges that the Prophet gave them.</p>
<p>Those who want to go into statistics – yes why not? Go and do a survey of women across various continents and religions and see how many of them will agree for a “happy” marriage if they are not being forced into it by their dependent circumstances. Get the figures for yourself so that you will not blame others for citing wrong figures. It’s not a question of whether monogamous marriages are breaking too – women don’t want polygamy unless men bring them to such a state that they have no choice but to accept it and project to the world a face of “happy willingness”.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention here again that both Radha and I mentioned this country where only the Muslim men are allowed by the Constitution to have 4 wives, but these Muslim men are not using their constitutional and religious privileges to have more than one wife – they are monogamous Muslims and perhaps much better human beings than the “pure and true Muslims” of the Arab countries. After all, what use is being a “true follower of any religion” if one doesn’t become a good human being. And if one becomes a good human being then no religions are required to realise the Supreme Divine Power, no matter by what name you call that Divine Power. Yes, it is possible to realise the Divine Power even without following any religion. And I don’t see how God becomes more pleased by men who want to have more than one wife.</p>

	<p>Whats the point of citing statistics for plural and single spouse divorces when its a well known fact that in the arab/muslim world…where polygamy is practiced….quite often the wife or wives involved in polygamy (by force usually) have no recourse to divorce even if they want to. I was in a marriage with just ONE wife…me…and yet I was forced to stay married simply because my children would be taken from me if I divorced….so I remained married to an abusive control freak who turned out to be a pedophile as well…simply because I couldnt bear to leave my children. Consider how many other wives out there wish they could divorce but cannot simply because their children are held hostage basically against them. Im sure the statistics would rise significantly if that were considered.</p>

	<p>Bruno,<br>
Since the other post is not relevant for the questions you posed me, I’m replying here – </p>
<p>As I said earlier, your response about polygamy reiterates the remark I made that KSA is not following the Islamic law in matters of marriage in different words. Besides, it also reiterates the questions I asked addressing Carol – how to get the government to make laws to protect such women and how to devise such a system where the women can get justice – since they can’t do much without their legal guardian etc. Apart from that about whether polygamy is abuse or not, we have taken opposite viewpoints – you insist that since you know few cases of women living “happily” in polygamy, it’s alright if abuse is not involved. I insist that polygamy is abuse, since women don’t want it – few stray cases don’t count, it works on the principle of devaluation of women and it includes psychological violence – you asked me if I understood the meaning of abuse – yes I do understand it and I want to emphasise here that violence is not only physical – it can have a PSYCHOLOGICAL dimension too. </p>
<p>My stand regarding this issue is not based on my own emotions and feelings as you state but on the fact that it is true that majority of women in all cultures and religions do not want it. Therefore it is wrong in every culture – if the Mormons practise it, it’s wrong and if the Muslims practise it, it’s wrong – regardless of whether it is sanctioned by religion or legal system. As I said earlier, everything can’t be sanctioned by the argument of religion or culture. This is one of such issues.<br>
I have cited examples of how practices change over a period of time because the needs of times change. And it’s really the strength of the ancient religions of the world that they have managed to modify their tenets and practices with the changing times. These religions have the tenacity to face criticism – both from within the community and from outside – and modify themselves – that’s how they have managed to survive for so many millenia. Perhaps Islam will do well to learn this tenacity to face criticism from other ancient religions.</p>
<p>If men like Abu Abdullah and you don’t want to accept this fact that most women don’t want polygamy, then I can’t say anything more about it.</p>
<p>About my reliance on Aafke and NN’s interpretations and whether they are my source of information  – my experience of interaction with Islam is not a recent one. I have said before that I live in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society. I deal with all world religions, not only Islam and I have spent all my life interacting with Muslims and people of other faiths. I also read the texts related to different faiths – not only Islam. So it’s not as if I heard about these interpretations for the first time from Aafke or NN, but they added to what I already knew, so I thanked them.<br>
About whether their interpretation is valid – they both have quoted directly from the primary sources – Aafke from Quran itself. If she has quoted the entire verse as it exists in Quran, I have no reason to suspect her integrity in quoting honestly. If you think Aafke is quoting wrongly, then you should show us what the verse is like and you can debate with Aafke about it.<br>
I can say the same for NN, since he too has quoted verses, not any secondary books.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that they are quoting out of context. The truth is that Muslim men who want to practise polygamy use these verses out of context because it facilitates their purpose. They have in fact placed the verses in their proper context of the Battle of Uhud, the situation of war widows and orphans. As for whether they are “Scholars” on the subject or not, that doesn’t matter if they are placing the original verses before the readers. The Scholars also interpret according to their social conditioning and their understanding which has grown in their times, which may not be the same after a couple of centuries. What was valid 200 years ago in a scholarly interpretation may not be valid now. In any case if you have read any Scholars, whom you trust, you can cite those interpretatiojns and debate with Aafke and NN about it. </p>
<p>In the end, I’ll only say this – it is not any religion of the world but the humane values that are most important. Rather than getting entangled into the web of what Islam says, what the Scholars say, whether some practice is Islamic or not, it is better to think whether this practice is humane or not. As I said, there is no point in being a good religionist if one doesn’t become a good human being. </p>
<p>But the greatest challenge before humans has always been to follow the simplest acts of humanity!</p>

	<p>As North American woman I could not tolerate another woman in my husband’s life. If I am to have a strong and loving relationship with someone then it has to be exclusive. I chose my husband because I loved him and he me. We do not want to share that love and bonding and in my opinion you can’t bond with someone if you do not have a strong and loving physical as well as mental relationship. I could not ‘give’ my body to a man who wasn’t my exclusive partner. After all, what man wants to share his wife with another man?? What is good for the goose is good for the gander.<br>
Now if marriages are arranged maybe it doesn’t matter? Many of  God’s creatures, wolves and eagles for example, mate for life and are monogamous. Why should humans be any different?</p>

Even in arranged marriages it does matter, though personally I’m against arranged marriages, but a lot of people go for it and they have the right to do so.</p>

	<p>I actually don’t have an interpretation of my own since I’m non-Muslim and this does not concern me.  I can, however, look at the text, read it and ask questions to arrive at conclusions.  Hey, if it makes sense, it should make sense to everyone with eyes and a brain, right?  </p>
<p>So that’s what I’ve done, as nowhere in the contemporary Muslim writing did I see a clear, sensible explanation of why polygamy and orphans are listed in the same verse, nor what rules, if any, does it impose on the practice.  People opine and come up with theories, but that’s all they are.  My personal opinion is that none of it makes sense to a sensible person.  </p>
<p>If what it means is to marry “mothers of orphans”, why doesn’t it say so? You have some verses in the same book that are exquisitely detailed, so it’s not like the author could not go into detail when it meant to.</p>
<p>If what it means is “not to marry orphan girls on unfavorable terms”, why doesn’t it say so? Besides, in my humble opinion, the scenario of a man, supervising an orphan girl, of marriageable age, who happens to have money, and needs to be protected from his ill motives is….how should I say this…too contrived to put in a book for all ages and all peoples.  Come on.  Who are these mysterious orphans with wealth management issues? It’s not like “what shall i do with all my money?” is a real burning priority for most orphans.  Survival, OK.  But wealth management? Nah. Doesn’t make sense. </p>
<p>Plus, what about orphan boys?  </p>
<p>Battle of Uhud? That came and went.  The book for all ages is not supposed to have an expiration date nor conditions that are specific to one event. </p>
<p>I’ll give you one more.  There is a real school of thought out there that says, the cap of four women is bogus.  If the book meant to say, two OR three OR four, it would use the AU not WA.  </p>
<p>So in my opinion, the only supportable, evidence-based conclusion is this. No one really knows what this verse means in full detail.  There is no one, widely acceeptable and understandable conclusion about the connection between fairness to orphans and multiple marriages.  The language is vague.  But since the message of the Quran has been delivered, formalized, legislated and implemented via men, the men have predictable taken the position that benefits the interests of men. That’s all there is to it.</p>

	<p>My niece is american and her husband has a child by another woman who he sees weekly. It’s the same all over the country but more likely to happen with minority and low income families. She happens to be uneducated and has some learing disorders. Her husband doesn’t allow her to visit her family. He is also ungodly and has no religious beliefs. I think his upbringing has a lot to do with this situation.  Please pray for her. Name is Vicky</p>
