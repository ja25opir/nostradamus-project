				<div class="content">I have worked with both Vicki and Robbie in the past in a number of different programs. The difference was that they had no control over what happened in those programs. They are straight up ladies who are always willing to help their fellow marketers out, but when a program is owned by another, there is always a limit to what they can do to help. Not with this one! As founders of the program, what they say goes. This is the most unique program I have ever been involved with. No matter if you have one position, twenty positions, or one hundred positions, you stand a chance of making money. And the scrambler! How unique is that?! Whether you are a the top or at the bottom, the scrambler will ensure that everyone gets their chance to be on top and make money. This program is as unique as the two ladies that are running it! I have to say, I have been involved in a number of programs before, and I have been disappointed many times as well. I don't see any disappointment in the future with this program. Robbie and Vicki are wonderful women both in the marketing arena and in my personal dealings with them. They are real down to earth people. When you need a helping hand, they are there for you. They are selfless women who are not greedy. They of course want to succeed, but they want to see others succeed as well. Others claim that their programs are the real deal; operated with transparency and integrity. Those other programs aint seen nothing yet! This one is the real deal, because it is being run by two real honest women!<br><br>I know this post was supposed to me about me, and actually it is. I am both proud and excited to say that I am involved with a program that was designed and is being operated by these two wonderful women. With them running the show, we'll all be successful!.</div>
