<p><em><strong>New Features of &nbsp;version 3.6…</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>(new in 3x) Multiple Layout Styles</strong></em> – <strong><em>12 Out of the box Templates tuned for Adsense</em></strong>- XFactored (original, alt, slim and wide), clickbumped, kubricked, inoved, clickmagnet, clickwise, blueswayde, blueswayde-alt and clickbumped-alt all ship with the package and are available for on-the-fly access. <em><strong>You get 12 templates right out of the box with more becoming available all the time</strong></em>.</li>
<li><em><strong>Multiple Ad Layout options</strong></em> – Choose to use a standard Xfactor style 336×280 ad block, or two 250×250 side by side ad blocks or even stacked ad blocks with text flow around them. You can also enable link units in the sidebars if you choose. All with a single click on the bountiful theme options panel. To flag a post for side &nbsp;by side ads is as simple as adding the “side-by-side-ads” category to it.</li>
<li><em><strong>On The Fly Color Selection</strong></em> – If enabled, a template can allow you to change its header and sidebar color. Both clickbumped templates allow you to change the header color. The clickmagnet theme allows you to change the site title background color and the header image.</li>
<li><em><strong>(new in 3.x) Replaces All In One SEO Plug-in</strong></em> – You can now create page by page meta descriptions and keywords, custom page titles with separate menu titles for maximum keyword leverage without cluttering menus.&nbsp;<strong><em>This negates the need to install All in One SEO or any other SEO plugin resulting in lightning fast page response.</em></strong><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></li>
<li><strong><em>Page by page custom images -<span style="font-weight: normal;"> You can now give every page a uniique set of product images</span>.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>(new in 3.x) Custom Page Titles – <span style="font-weight: normal;">The page title is THE MOST IMPORTANT Seo tool at your disposal. We give you the ability to separate your page title from your menu link title. This frees your page title from the menu system (which prefers smaller titles for menu spaces) allowing you to create a keyword rich page title that best positions your page against competing pages in your niche.</span></em></strong></li>
<li><em><strong>Image Sorting and Automatic Uploads</strong></em> – product images are easily batch uploaded into the appropriate media directories then sorted by filename allowing you additional control over the order in which they appear (widget-01.jpg appears before widget-02.jpg for example). In addition, if you are using my system for autoblogging posts where images are being inserted directly into post content, you can easily configure the theme to place the images in the appropriate directories automatically.</li>
<li><strong><em>(new in 3.x) Automated Menu Management</em></strong> – Show or hide the Site Menu, Recent Posts, Current Posts and SiteMap as well as rename them, all with complete control over display. As new pages and posts are created, they automatically appear in the appropriate menu. You can also define the number of posts and pages to display for incredible flexibility with autoblogging applications.</li>
<li><strong><em>(new in 3.x) Automated Management of Google Webmaster Verification</em></strong> – We provide an automated means of inserting your Google Webmaster Site Verification tag into your home page. Simply paste in your Google verification tag (its the same for every site you have) and ClickBump Engine does the rest.</li>
<li><strong><em>(new in 3.x) Automated Affiliate Link Management</em></strong> – To link your product images with your affiliate ID, you simply insert it into theme options and its automatically added to your product images enabling users to click through your affiliate link. Supports cloaked affiliate links.</li>
<li><em><strong>Comment &amp; Tag System Option</strong></em> – Enable Comments and/or post tags on pages and/or posts if you choose.</li>
<li><em><strong>Flexible Add-ons &amp; Upgrade Architecture</strong></em> – I’ve enabled version 3.x to seamlessly accept new templates as they are developed. You merely have to add a zipped template folder to your existing install via the new “Add New Template” button in theme options panel. Once uploaded, the new template will appear automatically for your immediate use. Update: As of version 2.6 the upgrade process has been added right into the theme options panel. just click the “Upgrade” button to <em><strong>seemlessly upgrade your whole clickbump engine to the latest version on the fly</strong></em>.</li>
<li><em><strong>The definitive Authority Site Publishing Engine for WordPress</strong></em> – auto hide posts and pages, flag posts for top menu, overflow posts in sidebar, auto generated sitemaps, custom css, custom tracking code, affiliate ready images, flexible enough for Adsense, Affiliates or Autoblogging applications, and much more. This is the definitive system for Authority, Adsense and Affiliate publishers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><br>
Introducing, the &nbsp;Templates (<span style="font-weight: normal;">many more to become available soon via the template marketplace</span></em><em>)</em></strong></p>
<p><em>(Note: Adsense Blocks are not turned on in these screenshots, but the Adsense 336×280 block would appear directly under the post title, unless post excerpts are turned on, in which case, the ads appear under the post excerpt)<br>

<p><strong>I’ve never solicited testimonials from my customers,</strong> I figure if I do my job and simply take care of people, they will naturally want to share their success with others. And that’s why its completely gratifying at the amazing amount of unsolicited comments I’ve received from people who’ve purchased the ClickBump Engine…</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Scott, I really can’t describe how excited these last few days have been since purchasing your themes.</p>
<p>I have a junk site that I use to practice on before installing plugins and themes on my “good” sites.  Well within a couple days of installing one of your themes on my test blog it started making over a dollar a day with adsense.  I couldn’t belive it.  Every site I own combined have never made this much money for me.  You’re probably laughing about being so excited about a few bucks but I honestly feel like I won the lotto.  After all the junk I’ve purchased online, I’ve finally found something that really works.  Thank you so much.  Jim</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hey Scott!</p>
<p>Man, I gotta tell you…this CE3 and Jumpstart are absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>When I first used Jumpstart, I saw the advatage, but I was still wasting time editing and then having to create a new Jumpstart.zip for each site.  Today, I put up a site and just used the original files.  I didn’t realize that Jumpstart filled in all the blanks for me…duh.  Absolutely Awesome!</p>
<p>Thanks for continuing to produce great stuff!</p>
<p>- John Amorosso</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I bought your Wordpress theme for the XFactor method last night and got it working on one of my web sites in about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Stunning. Brilliant! So much easier for me than messing around with XSitePro 2. I mean I am already making decent money from affiliate blogs and I’m quite used to Wordpress from that experience, so this theme was and will be a real timesaver. I think I’ll actually start enjoying the writing part again now that I don’t have to “mess” with as much stuff.</p>
<p>Plus I have always loved the benefits of Wordpress plugins like “Easy Privacy Policy”, “Contact Form 7″, and of course “Google XML Sitemap” and “All in One SEO” … makes for a VERY fast web site! And let’s face it, Google loves it.</p>
<p>Worth every cent I spent. – Jack M (um1001)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wow,</p>
<p>Yes this is awesome. I purchased a few days ago, but I waited for this 3.x release and it looks very impressive. This is going to make my site building go so much faster.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your great work.<br>

<blockquote><p>The template!!!!  I love the template!!!!  Man!  it is so great to just toggle a few things and get right to work.  I am no sissy when it comes to adjusting the code….it’s just that I have no idea what the heck I am doing. lol</p>
<p>If you want me to write up a professional testimonial, just let me know – I’d be glad to.</p>
<p>It is truly awesome and you are a true gem because you worked with me to get it working on a subdomain/subdirectory, which was new for the product at the time.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>

<blockquote><p>Scott,</p>
<p>I’ve gotten your ClickBump Engine this afternoon (my time). At $xx, it’s a bargain. I was expecting it to be higher.</p>
<p>Anyway, I put it to use on one web site and it worked straight out of the box. Since you provide everything with the theme, I uninstalled a couple of plugins which are redundant now. <img src="http://clickbump.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley">  -ykpmnac</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hey Scott,</p>
<p>Your templates are amazing, I’ll time one from “CPanel to content ready” for you tomorrow and right you up a testimonial. I’m projecting 35 minutes, we’ll see. My first two were stop/start but I have it down now. I’m going to write it down so my wife can be loading them up while I write. – lancerbear</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>i’ve already finished setting up my site. Took me about 15 mins! How quick was that! – msoon77</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You’re the bomb, Scott.  No wonder I  haven’t caught you on the forum the past few days! – kymom</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for this Scott!</p>
<p>I tinkered for HOURS to try and get a WP template for  a MNWebsite site. Now I get it handed to me for only xx (still alot of  money to me though). I sure needed this and the ease of making websites will allow me to continue and actually make money for ONCE   <img src="http://clickbump.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>I am sooo pumped up now.</p>
<p>Thanks, jimfrr</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Scott-  That template is amazing, it must cut down the amount of time spent on building these sites by at least 60% for me! much appreciated. – ej2009</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wow, I’m really, really impressed with your ClickBump Engine.   Finally a script that loads easily<br>
and works fantastic.  I appreciate you my friend.   Got my hours cut back on my job and this<br>
wonderful engine will help supplement my income.   I appreciate you my friend.</p>
<p>Thanks again Scott.</p>
<p>To your success,</p>
<p>Rick Davis</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Scott,</p>
<p>Well done!</p>
<p>Clean code and refreshingly fun and straightforward interface.</p>
<p>Seriously Scott, nice work! – digitaltracker</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>I just wanted to say thank you a million times over for all you do. You have been the difference in me being able to do this with all your patient explanations….if you are not already a Father, you’ll be a great one!</p>
<p>I really appreciate the energy and thoughtfulness you put in everything.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Anne</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wow. So far, I’m loving the additions. I was really itching for the ability to insert a line of text under the title (I’m the helpless paranoid type). And the Sitemap function!</p>
<p>I can’t believe I was missing out on all of this! This is great, Scott! Thank you. I was really starting to worry about the possibility of one day in the future wanting to expand sites. I want to stick with this theme, as I’m loving it more and more by the day. But I was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to expand on sites when I find the true gems without making my header look ridiculous. Allowing for overflow posts in the sidebar = brilliant. – cowboyrob</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Your theme/automation is great!  The first site I put up on Saturday night and when I woke up on Sunday it was sitting at #5!  Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Like I said, I just got on the forum and your thread and information is fantastic!  As many have said, it is inspirational and quite generous.  I do sincerely appreciate it, and hope that while this $xx is a small payment, that I’ll be able to pay you back many times over in ‘karma’ with stories of success. – MexiKen</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hey Scott,</p>
<p>Thanks for the superb support!</p>
<p>You make me feel secure with the template.</p>
<p>I never regretted buying from you.</p>
<p>Thanks heaps, razorblade</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hey Scott,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the reply and details! I can’t wait to start using the template. I love working with wordpress and your template for John’s course just made it ten times better! Thanks again! – daver</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hi Scott</p>
<p>I purchased the ClickBump WP themes two days ago – i just wanted to say how pleased i am with the way they function – simply spectacular!! I only appreciate it because i have spent countless hours in the past fiddling with other theme setting manually .. – kaka</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hi Scott, I don’t know if you remember that I asked about your themes a month or so ago and didn’t buy them.  I had a change of heart a few days ago and bought, even though it cost me an extra $10 to do so!  I’m not sorry though.  Very impressed and thanks! – Vince</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I’ve just bought your CE v2, and I must say I’m impressed. At first I was sceptical about this whole thing, but now I must say I’m completely satisfied.</p>
<p>Everything, from the download of CE v2 to the installation went smoothly. Well, except for one problem I had. Luckily, that problem was there just to prove how fast support really is. I received a detailed answer with screenshots and useful tips (that I didn’t even ask for) almost immediately after asking for help.</p>
<p>Whole Clickbump Engine v2 is simply amazing. Every function is there for a reason. Everything was made to save me a lot of time. This investment was worth every cent.</p>
<p>It’s so easy to change the theme color (sidebar or header), to add/remove sidebar link unit, to change themes, add photos… And it comes with really good step by step tutorial.</p>
<p>In short, everything is only one click away. This was definitely my best buy and it will fit my Adsense micro niche project perfectly.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I purchased the clickbump engine version 3 about a week ago.<br>
I was really excited to get it thinking that it would allow me to make web sites really quickly.<br>
After I got it I was a bit disappointed due to the fact, that it took me 3 hours to make my first site.<br>
I contacted Scott and told him of my disappointment.  He explained to me some key steps I was missing and from then it’s been a breeze.  Scott has been really responsive to my questions and I’ve actually made 15 niche sites since getting the software. I even purchased the jumpstart and that is incredible.<br>
Literally, my sites are now  done in about 3 minutes, all I have to do is go in and tweak a couple of things.  The fact that you can choose multiple templates on the fly is good when you are trying to see what is more pleasing to the eye.  Scott has emailed me various CSS codes and has really helped me with any questions that I had.  If you are skeptical about this product don’t be!  Make sure to buy both the clickbump engine and the jumpstart. They work wonderfully together!<br>
- Tracy McLaughlin</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thanks Scott, I must say I am impressed with the way my CTR has improved since ditching the superadsense theme and using your and John’s xfactor theme, the CTR has doubled. Thanks for releasing such a user friendly theme that converts brilliantly.<br>
Best wishes<br>
Linda</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hi, I’m happy with your clickbump product — very happy, actually. Personally, I think that you should charge more, considering it’s TWELVE awesome themes, customizable…and that Socrates for WP (Joel Comm’s I think) and Thematic cost a bit more for ONE theme.</p>
<p>Going to spread the love when I begin blogging about my online marketing progress, haven’t yet began that.  I did find you at Mike Iser (<a href="http://mikeiser.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/mikeiser.com');">mikeiser.com</a>) — a fellow commenter mentioned you a few times.</p>
<p>Thanks again for an AMAZING product!</p>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>Several warriors and I spent the span of a couple of days last week pouring our hearts into a thread which was titled…</p>
<p><em><strong>“My First $100 day on the Xfactor method”</strong></em></p>
<p>In which I posted my journey from Adsense noob (I only made $20 in two years with Adsense on a daily update blog) to what you might call a somewhat reluctant “<em><strong>Adsense phenom</strong></em>” in the span of two short months. I made $309 dollars my first month, then doubled that the next month with $807.12</p>
<p>This month I’m on track to double that and I’m at $1223.06 as of today for the month of November.</p>
<p><em><strong>So in a little over 2.5 months, I’ve gone from $20 in my Adsense account, to $2339.00 and counting…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em> I did it by applying the techniques of <a href="http://clickbump.com/resources/xfactor">Xfactor </a>(aka John, the $300 a day Adsense guy) along with some of my own unique <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization">seo</acronym> optimization techniques and an interesting indexing method I call the “Sneaky Punctuation Trick”</p>
<p><em>So that brings us to the point of this post…</em></p>
<p>Several fellow warriors have asked what happened to the thread that I posted where I detailed my techniques and laid everything bare for others to learn.</p>
<p>You can read the full story over on my <a href="http://www.warriorforum.com/blogs/clickbump/8620-clickbumped-missing-thread.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.warriorforum.com');">blog at Warrior Forum</a>, but the gist is this: <em><strong>it never went anywhere</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A Wise Man once said, “A city on a hill cannot be hidden”, and like that city, knowledge is a light that cannot be put out (especially with persistent caching and PDFs <img src="http://clickbump.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>So that brings me to the reason for this post. I happened to have my tabs left open all night that night and had both threads displayed. So I’ve got every last post that was made there and I’m creating a PDF of it and I’m going to sell it for…</p>
<p>&lt;just kidding&gt;</p>
<p>Gotcha! I’ve created a downloadable PDF of it right here on my server and anyone who wants the to learn the <a href="http://clickbump.com/twil/My-first-$100-dollar-day-on-Xfactor-method-page1.pdf" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/twil/My-first-$100-dollar-day-on-Xfactor-method-page1.pdf');">clickbump twist on the Xfactor method</a> (&lt;part 1 PDF 41 pages) knowledge can <a href="http://clickbump.com/twil/My-first-$100-dollar-day-on-Xfactor-method-Page2.pdf" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/twil/My-first-$100-dollar-day-on-Xfactor-method-Page2.pdf');">get it for free</a> (&lt; part 2 PDF 25 pages).</p>

					<p class="posted">Posted on 09 January 2009 by Scott</p>

						<blockquote><p>[Update:] Since this post was originally created back in October, <strong>I’ve made over $14k with Google Adsense in less than a year (<em>part time – I have a day job too <img src="http://clickbump.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve done it solely by creating tiny little niche websites with Google Adsense ads at the top of every post page. The method by which I’ve done this, using a combination of “Xfactor Adsense” teachings along with George Brown’s Google Sniper techniques, has come to be known as the “<strong><a href="http://clickbump.com/ce">ClickBump Method</a></strong>“.</p>
<p>The common thing though, that has enabled me to rapidly turn out niche websites that make money on virtual auto-pilot, is the <strong><a href="http://clickbump.com/ce">WordPress Template Engine</a></strong> that I created to run all my sites. I call it ClickBump Engine and since I first packaged it and began offering it to other Adsense andClickBank publishers, it has achieved phenomenal success and accolades from customers. The fact that I use this same system every day, means I’m constantly updating and tweaking it for maximum ranking power to <strong><em>keep my sites on the top of Google</em></strong>.</p>
<p>But it was all based on the foundation of teachings I learned in a remarkably powerful ebook from a guy named John (XFactor) who’s come to be a mentor and friend.</p>
<p>If after reading this review of John’s <strong>Xfactor Adsense Course</strong>, you decide to <a href="http://clickbump.com/go/xfactor">purchase the course using my affiliate link,</a> I’ll offer you the ClickBump Engine version 3 system at a 20% discount off the current price. The only requirement is that you must <a href="http://clickbump.com/ce">order the ClickBump Engine system</a> within 48 hours of purchasing John’s course.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Originally posted on October 3o, 2009</em></p>
<p><strong>I just got a $309.82 check today from Google, Inc.<br>
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>(you can view it at the bottom of this post. This was my very first check ever from Google. Since then, I’ve received checks in excess of $2k)</em></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://clickbump.com/resources/xfactor">To see the how I was able to do it, click here</a></p>
<p><strong><em>This was my first check ever from Google</em></strong>, despite having a blog with Adsense ads (not this one actually) in which I posted nearly every day and drew a respectable amount of traffic.</p>
<p><strong><em>So what was it that it that finally broke my two year drought and got me my first Adsense check? In a word, a guy named John</em></strong>. John goes by username Xfactor on the forum where I first discovered him when he wrote a post that chronicled <strong>how he made $300 a day from Adsense alone</strong>.<br>
<strong><br>
<em>That got my attention</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Especially since I’d been going at it pretty steady for two years and <strong>had only managed to accumulate a grand total of $20.32</strong> in all that time from the Adsense ads I had peppered around my daily blog posts.</p>
<p>In his post, John laid out his basic outline of how he had managed to <strong>triple his Adsense income in six months</strong>. He went on further to list, point by point, his lessons learned along the way. <strong>This became the basis of the ebook he would later write</strong> (and I would later purchase).</p>
<p><strong>And here is the golden nuggets of that post that started <em>this whole crazy Xfactor thing</em></strong>…</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>From One Big Site to Many Many Small Sites</strong>- John originally had one big honking site that took quite a lot of his time and he began to completely reverse that strategy and started building a lot of tightly focused single-page micro sites.</li>
<li><strong>Product Niches</strong> – He began to focus on product niches. Reasoning that people searching for products were likely ready to buy, thus ready to click</li>
<li><strong>Low Competition, Moderate Traffic Keywords</strong> – He began to hone in on product keywords where there was a decent amount of traffic to make money, but not so much that getting a first page ranking in Google would be unattainable</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong> – John embraced the volume concept and forced himself to research and launch 4-5 sites a week. With this volume of sites, he could settle for a 20-25% success rate and still launch 1 money making site a week. A perpetual source of passive income with compounding dividends</li>
<li><strong>Use Article Marketing Exlusively for SEO</strong> – This is perhaps where I disagree a bit with John’s approach, but its hard to argue with his success. John advocates using article marketing exclusively for site rankings with backlinks. I tend to favor depending on my niche research to birth a site that does not require backlinking to stay on top of the search engines. My main strategy for this is site optimization and domain name selection. To be fair, John advocates for some of this as well.</li>
<li><strong>A Curiously Clickable Template</strong> – This is the single biggest draw that got me to pull the trigger on John’s course. After reading about the incredible performance of John’s template layout, I had to see it with my own eyes. I can honestly say, I was completely surprised when I saw it, but over the past two months, my bank account is testament to the fact that the <em><strong>layout, colors and subtle simplicity of the “Xfactor look” is </strong><strong>incredibly effective at drawing clicks on product ads.</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>So after reading this post and becoming quite intrigued at how he was able to triple his income in such a short time and how everything seemed to revolve around launching many little tightly focused niche sites all wrapped in this mysteriously elusive template, <strong><em>I could not resist any longer and decided to purchase his course</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I’m sitting here a little over two months since that day I found out about John and his ebook and course and as I said in the opening, <strong><em>I just got my very first check ever today from Google in the amount of $309.62</em></strong> ($20.32 of that was for revenue accrued from March 2007 until Sept 2009 with my alternative energy site, the rest was as a result of the following John’s e-book from September 9, 2009 through today)</p>
<p><strong><em>As I sit today, I’ve already doubled my first month’s income and accrued $749.91 following John’s methods</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This has all been made by following John’s <a href="http://clickbump.com/resources/xfactor">Adsense Master Course E-book</a> and a few twists of my own in terms of tweaking the program for SEO (I really dislike article marketing so I’ve turbo charged John’s template layout and created a WordPress version that basically builds the site with a few clicks). <strong><em>My version has been pretty effective thus far with several sites hitting page one with virtually no backlinking done on my part</em>.</strong></p>
<p>If you are skeptical or have been burned by ebook offers in the past, all I can say is that this is a completely different animal altogether. This system works, almost too well. <strong><em>Its dang near addicting</em></strong>! The proof is in the check I just received and I’m on track to double my income each month following this formula.<img src="http://clickbump.com/wp-content/uploads/sept-check.jpg" alt="My First Adsense Check - Oct 09"></p>
