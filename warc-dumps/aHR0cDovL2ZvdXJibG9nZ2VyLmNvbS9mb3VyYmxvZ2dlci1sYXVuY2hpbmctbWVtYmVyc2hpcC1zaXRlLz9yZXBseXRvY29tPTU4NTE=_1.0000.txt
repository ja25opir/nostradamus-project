Fourblogger launching Membership Website For You!

by Pascal on June 19, 2010

Hi guys! I am VERY VERY happy to announce this. I am very soon going to launch a Membership website to help YOU. Today I am just writing a short description about what it is.

Is it for YOU?

I have framed every bit of this membership website to be as MUCH as useful to all bloggers. Bloggers who blog for making money, bloggers who maintain business blogs, designers who design Thesis blogs can get huge benefit from this membership site.

What makes it unique?

Actually before thinking of launch this site, I was bit nervous. To make a product in highly populated (or polluted :? :) ) area, really I should have more courage.

To someone who would like to join, I have to give best reasons for why should join in this site. Isn’t it? Finally I came with best reasons and that reasons made this membership site unique.

“I and my team will guide you on all your blogging efforts – when you won’t be able to follow our guidelines, ask me, I will produce video tutorials for your easy; when you won’t be able to follow even our video tutorials, ask me, I will come down straight to field and get your login details and complete it on behalf you”

This is what the  idea which make this membership site as unique and useful to YOU.

How do all these work?

9 Modules with Hundreds of Video through over the membership period

Inside members only protected area, MORE & MORE video tutorials will be delievered in regular interval. These video tutorials cover 9 Modules. Each module states every part of a blogger’s life cycle. Video tutorials just start from registering domain and then it goes to great end like launching paid ebook, paid membership site etc.

Huge Valued Bonuses at regular intervals

Many Bonus items have been set up to be delivered to YOU at regular intervals. To mention, some of the bonuses here, first one, “How to launch your paid ebook?” which has 20+ video tutorials, another one bonus, “How to launch your paid Membership website?” which has 40+ video tutorials.

Thesis Theme (http://fourblogger.com/resources/thesis) customization course

I am not basically a coder. I did NOT know what is PHP, what is Firebug, what is CSS until before 7 months. But as I was knowing where to start and learn, I became successful at it. I am going to show my customization skills as a course, from which you will know how to start from scratch as a newbie and how to become great thesis customization expert.

This course will be delivered as video tutorials once per week through over the course period.

24*7 Forum – MEMBERS ONLY PRIVATE AREA

I am usually pushing myself to work 18 hours a day. This comes habitually due to my 5 years of online living. I scheduled my team to work on whole day so that Forum will be active for 24 hrs a day & 7 days a week.

Forum structured NOT based on our easy to use or imitation of other forums. It has been structured based on the problems that bloggers face everyday. There are totally 25 Forums & Sub-Forums. You will be getting replies for all your questions.

How could you use this Membership site in great way other than obvious ways?

1. You CAN do the things that you do NOT believe you can do in your blogging.

Have you ever thought you could launch a free ebook to catch subscribers? You may want to do it but don’t know how to do all the stuffs? You can just express through members only Forum your wish about launch a free ebook. I will guide you in whole process.

Have you ever thought you could build email list and make money through it? Just express your wish. I will help you in setting up all the things and we can sit and watch how your list grows.

Have you ever thought you could start a forum in your blog and grow it? Just express your wish. I will help you in setting up all the things, growing up it day by day.

Haven’t you thought that you can do these things by yourself without outsourcing for big bucks?

2. You CAN save money

Save hundreds of bucks. Think, how much you will be charged to do small Thesis customizations? to get one ecover? to get installed your membership website? to get help on creating screencasts & videos? to get done SEO for your blog?

You will have to spend lots of money or you will leave the idea of doing these things. In both cases, big loss to you & to your blog. If you choose my membership site then win-win situation in both cases. You can save the money and at the same time you can do the things that you don’t believe you can.

3. Getting Traffic & Making money

Never it would be dream. Actually I just don’t want to write you how to get traffic. Once you joined and get inside the membership site, do you think I will be telling “hey do this” “hey do this”. But I won’t. I am not going to tell you “do this to make money” & “do this to drive traffic”.

Then What?

I am going to show a LIVE CASE STUDY. I will show how i am building a $100,000/month (Yes. You count it right. Just a hundred thousand dollar) earning blog in a year.

I explain little bit more. I will make a live case study post once in every week (at week end) inside the membership site. That post will show you what I did in whole week on the $100,000 challenge blog. That post will be having complete screencast videos of what I did in my computer to build & grow that blog.

After ONE YEAR, the blog will be making AT LEAST $100,000 every month.

If you want to make money in blogging, you can choose any niche and apply all the tricks I am using then you will be seeing traffic & money.

Clickbank Approval

Even though setting up the membership site was bit time consuming, the end result came great. More than this, we have received approval from Clickbank. By setting up Clickbank, we make sure members are getting guaranteed program & affiliates are getting guaranteed commissions.

Membership Site Launch

Membership website will be launched next week. I will inform you all in couple of days about the launch day. I will be giving great discount for early joiners. Be ready to join.

Contact me via email (http://fourblogger.com/about/contact-us/) or comments, if you have any questions to be answered.

Hi Norman, No.

Currently I didn’t have blog that makes 100K.

It is going to happen as I will be applying all the traffic techniques that I have learned in last 5 years.

Congratulations!!! If the quality is anything like your thesis tutorials (which I have used many) and your articles, then it is going to be outstanding!! I think it is a great idea to have a paid forum! I am looking forward to seeing how this develops.
