        by the church</li>
        <li>Motivate church leaders to focus on the

          <h2 class="title"> The Book's Message</h2>
						<p class="body"></p><p>Richard Baxter, a respected pastor who lived
         in the Puritan age of the 1600s, wrote this classic
         to communicate his conviction that revival was
         desperately needed in the churches of England. He
         believed it could start if the pastors would repent
         for neglecting their congregations and would become
       the caring shepherds God intended them to be.</p>
       <p>Baxter believed that English pulpits were too
         often being used for flowery speech to tickle the
         listeners’ ears or even to boost the self-esteem of
         the pastors themselves. Convinced that solid biblical
         teaching was lacking, he launched a movement</p><p></p>
						<h2><a name="1" id="1"></a>The Character of a Pastor </h2>
      <p class="style1">“A wrong motive that aims at a wrong goal may well
      spoil the whole ministry, however good it may be in itself.”</p>
      <p>A pastor must understand the art of self-denial. It is mandatory for an
        effective ministry, one that pleases God, one that is not self-seeking~one
        that seeks the glory of God and the salvation of His people.</p>
      <table width="275" border="2" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="2" bordercolor="#660033">
                <tbody><tr>
                  <td width="245" bgcolor="#B1D566" class="maindiv"><h1 align="center">“Self-denial is absolutely necessary for every
                    Christian. But it is doubly necessary for a minister
                    of the Gospel, because he has to have a double
                    dedication and sanctification to God.”</h1></td>
                </tr>
      </tbody></table>		      
      <p>First, the pastor’s motives must be pure. Second, the pastor must be
      diligent and willing to put forth all the hard work that will be required.</p>
      <p>Third, the minister must be wise and efficient, working in an orderly,
        systematic way. He must always offer milk before meat, because some may
        still need to be brought to a saving knowledge of Christ before any more
        spiritual growth can happen. <em>“People must be brought into a state of grace
        before we can expect them to do the works of grace.”</em></p>
      <p>Fourth, the pastor must be certain and unswerving in teaching the basic
        doctrines, not bending in teaching the unquestionable truths of Scripture,
        however unpleasant they may be sometimes to the unbeliever. He must
        prioritize by sticking to <em>“those central truths, and ... avoid frivolous details,
        needless décor, and unprofitable controversy.”</em></p>
      <p>Fifth, he must make it his duty and responsibility to be heard and understood,
        not speaking above the comprehension level of the audience, but
        speaking in a tone and a manner that appeal to their specific needs. Sixth,
        the pastor must remain dependent on God, realizing his human insufficiency
        in the light of His divine sufficiency. He must pray for his people, <em>“For he
        who does not pray for his people will not preach powerfully to his people.”</em></p>
      <p>Seventh, the pastor must understand and exemplify humility. As he
        ministers to his flock, he must be openhearted and willing to learn whatever
        God wants to teach him through them. He must be careful to avoid haughtiness,
        as though his level of education makes him greater in God’s eyes
        than a simple farmer, for instance, for we know that God loves all of His
        children equally.</p>

        the balance between severity and
        gentleness when dealing with disciplinary
        situations. If he errs on the
        side of severity, the congregation
        will fail to see a loving heart, and
        if he errs on the side of gentleness
        without “speaking the truth in
        love,” he will lose the respect of
        the people, as a child does for a
      parent who doesn’t discipline him.</p>
      <p>Ninth, the pastor must preach
        with a loving, zealous spirit! <em>“Let
        us then, with much affectionate
        desire for our hearers, sharpen our
        words in such a way that we pierce

        his members at all costs that he
        loves and cares about them.</p>

      <p>Twelfth and finally, the pastor
        must learn and nurture patience in
        his life. He needs to bear the hurts
        of those who do not want to accept
        the truth. After the pastor has given
        all he can in loving them, visiting
        them, and doing good for them,
        people may still look upon him
      with contempt for the God who he proclaims. But that is no reason to give up; rather, it is a reason that
      <em>“we must still persist in instructing those who oppose their own best interests.”</em></p>
      <p>In the same way a surgeon who has taken the Hippocratic Oath must
        not ignore a patient who is bleeding to death but doesn’t want help, the
        pastor must not ignore the soul that refuses the truth, denying the fact that
        the person is headed for eternal damnation. Instead, he should continue
        praying for this person’s repentance and transformation.</p>
      <h2><a name="2" id="2"></a>Evaluating Our Lives
        and Developing
      the Heart of a Pastor</h2>
              <p class="style1">“Is it possible also that many a preacher is now in hell

              utmost care and diligence to escape its dark destiny?”</p>
              <p>The truth is that it is possible for such a thing to happen, for a man
                preaching against the darkness and detriment of such a horrible eternal hell
                to end up there himself for lack of evaluating his own heart and life while
                on this earth. Therefore, we must not neglect ourselves, because we have

                into the heavenly realms.</p>
              <p>We should take heed to ourselves, then, by examining our lives to find
                those areas in which we have allowed sin to creep in. And then we must
                allow God to rid us of that sin at all costs! For it is easy to stand on the seat
                of supreme judgment over a congregation for their sins and preach against
                such sins, but <em>“it is easier to judge sin than to overcome it”</em> ourselves.</p>
              <p>Also, we must be aware of the magnitude of the task to which we have
                been called, and then study and pray to gain the knowledge and empowerment
                that is mandatory for such a high calling. Not only must we study well and
                extensively to understand as much as we can of the mysteries of God, but
                we must be able to relate and communicate to our congregations in ways

                of the things of God than most
                other men do. This means we are
                held to a greater level of accountability

              <p>We also must recognize and confess the sins of the church as a whole.
                From my perspective, there are four main sins that now threaten the church:</p>
              <p><span class="style1">1. Pride</span>
                Pride, sometimes, is the core reason behind the topics on which we
                choose to preach. Our own popularity and status is more a concern than
                the salvation of our audience, and this must not be! If suddenly we find
                ourselves looking to the right and left, asking what men think of us instead
                of what God thinks of us, we have hit a dangerous point indeed!
                To be <em>“a proud preacher of humility is, to say the least,”</em> to be <em>“a selfcondemning
                man.”</em></p>

              <p><span class="style1">2. Undervaluing the unity and peace of the whole church</span>
                Many of us are guilty of failing to look beyond the realms of our
                individual denominations. In this, we lack perspective and fail to see
                through God’s eyes how we can best serve one another and promote
                unity. Instead, we cause divisive rifts between denominations as well as
                individual people as we focus on the issues that are not fundamental to
              the saving grace of Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p><span class="style1">3. Lack of commitment to the work of God</span>
                It is the unfortunate case amongst us, my brethren, that there is not
                enough zeal in our sermons, stemming from a lack of passion for what
                we do and who we do it for. We are serving <em>God</em> and not men, performing
                tasks and doing work that God has ordained as highly significant for
                ushering His children into His kingdom. Therefore, we must not shrink
                back in fear or complacency, but realize it is only through Christ we gain
                the strength to perform such great tasks.</p>
              <p>It is He in us who does the work, by no skill or talent of our own. So
                to be good stewards of what He has entrusted to us, we must not be
                negligent in our study of Scripture, in praying for our congregations,
                in visiting them, in teaching them with all the zeal inside of us! That
                passion will show itself in the most sincere way when we realize the magnitude
                and reality of heaven and hell and allow God to work through
                that realization.</p>
              <p>So do not take this sacred work lightly! <em>“We ought to study how to
              convince, and how to get inside people, and how to learn to bring the
              truth to the quick~not to leave it in the air. Experience tells us that we
              cannot be learned or wise without hard study, unwearied labors, and
              experience.”</em></p>
              <p>Also, keep a keen eye on the congregations surrounding you that may
                be lacking in the number of leaders and lend a hand whenever you can.</p>
              <p><span class="style1">4. Lack of church discipline</span>
                Every pastor must count the cost before entering headlong into ministry, because if he does not, he will be
                surprised and disappointed to learn
                of the suffering that may occur.
                Hearers of your messages may hate
                you for your straightforward approach
                to proclaiming the gospel,
                but you should not apologize for
                speaking the truth if you do it in
                love.</p>
              <p>For Christ <em>“foretold that the
  world would hate us.”</em> He came to
                bring a heavenly peace not an earthly
                peace. And you may have to
                discipline people to the point of
                excommunication, as a last resort
                when all other attempts at correction
                have failed. But you must not
                shrink from this duty for fear of
                unpopularity or unwanted scrutiny.
                It would be wrong to do so, to
                neglect this last resort which may
                be just what that person needs to
      come to salvation.</p>
              <p>The concept of discipline, then,
                ought to be part of the work of
                the church, because only then can
                discipline be implemented by proper
                principles. But the world will
                measure, and thus implement, discipline
                in a different way. Many
                times, people mistakenly want
                <em>“discipline to be established and
imposed by the secular power and
not the church. But if we are Christ’s
ambassadors, sent to speak in His
name, how can we do it in another
prince’s name?”</em></p>

                lives will surely show it. Then we
                must take heed regarding the lives
                of the members of our congregations
                and must be willing to administer
                church discipline when necessary.</p>
              <h2><a name="3" id="3"></a>Shepherding the Flock </h2>
              <p>There must always be enough pastors to look after the whole congregation
                through ministry to <em>individuals</em>. If your church is too large for
              such a personal kind of ministry, there are not enough leaders.</p>
              <p>As pastors we must first be convicted of our reason for being, to glorify
                God in everything. From that vantage point, we must serve Christ wholeheartedly
                and realize the weight of our calling. Through God’s strength
                and wisdom, we must then focus on the sanctification of those we shepherd.
                At all costs, we should pursue the heart of God as He pursues ours
                and as He longs for the full submission of His people. This means delighting
                in the worship of the saints, hating sin, upholding purity and the fruit
                of the Spirit, and seeking peace between members and denominations by
                loathing divisiveness.</p>
              <p>As far as the character behind ministry, it ought not be secular but
                sacred. We are dealing with matters of eternal value, and thus of utmost
                importance. It is not to be confused or combined with the temporary
                matters and business of this earth. It is, rather, to be focused on the things
                above as we warn men, women, and children of the danger and reality of
                hell and discuss with them the blessed joys of heaven!</p>

              <p>We must look first to the whole community of the church and then
                to the individuals themselves who make up the church. In leading them,
                we must know them~their temperaments, their struggles, their doubts,
                their families. First, we should focus on the conversion of the unsaved,
                because many claim a salvation they do not actually possess. The goal is
                not to sit in judgment about whether they <em>are</em> or <em>are not </em>born again, but
                to personally make extra effort to minister to those who leave us wondering
              by their lifestyles.</p>
              <p>Second, we should minister to those who already know Christ as Savior.
                But among these, there are the spiritually weak and those easily swayed
                by falsehood. There are the morally deficient, addicted to particular sins,
                which we must discern and steer them away from. There are those who
                have fallen away and need to be encouraged and pushed toward their first
                love. Sometimes, it may be due to a pitfall of a certain sin and other times
                due to a poisoning complacency that steals their joy and zeal for God.</p>
              <p>Also, there are those in need of comfort.</p>
              <p>And, finally, there are the dedicated, strong pursuers of Christ. This
                last group, though seemingly not as urgent in the list of priorities for a
                minister of the gospel, is still in need of encouragement and preservation.
                They must know that we care, that we are praying for their individual needs,
                and that we need their help in ministering to those weaker than they.</p>
              <p>What are the different works and tasks performed, then, by a pastor?
                To publicly preach the Word of God. To lead believers in the partaking of the Lord’s Supper. To carry out
                baptisms through Christ’s divine
                ordination. To lead in public prayer
                and praise in order to magnify God.
                To care for every sheep of the pastor’s
                flock personally and to encourage
                the heads of each family to
                take responsibility for the spiritual
                climate of their homes and for the
                growth of their loved ones. To visit
                and pray for the sick. Pastors do
                all of this, and they discipline the
                unrepentant as well.</p>
              <p>The last work named in the
                series above~discipline of the unrepentant~
                must be done carefully,
                with humility and wisdom from
                above. However, it should never
                be avoided because it is difficult
                or it may cause us some amount
                of personal suffering. Though we
                must not be too severe in correcting
                an unrepentant soul for his sin,
                we must not be too lenient either
                and, in that way, make light of sin.
                We should make it clear that sin is
                nothing to take lightly and should
                follow the steps laid out in Scripture
                to administer discipline in the proper
                way.</p>
              <p>Do not, though, mistake
                <em>discipline</em> for <em>legalism</em>. Many look
                down upon church discipline because
                they fail to understand how
                God designed it to work. It is not
                about a list of rules and regulations
                for which many criticize the Puritans,
                but instead, it is a road to freedom
                in Christ for the impenitent. It is
                tough love, with the purpose of
                bringing healing and restoration
                to those who need it to see their
                error.</p>

              <h2><a name="4" id="4"></a>Right Versus Wrong Motives in Tending the Flock </h2>
      <p>Being overseers of those God has placed under our care is our first
        proper motive for what we do. The office we maintain is the reason for
        what we do~to oversee the flock~and, in this calling, we should be honored
        and blessed. After all, it is not everyone who <em>“can keep a continual
        Sabbath. Whether we be alone or with others, our business is about the
      other world.”</em></p>
      <p>Second, it is the Holy Spirit who calls us and because of this, we ought
        to form no argument, for to do so would be dangerous. So motivations
        for pastoral leadership come from the office we hold, the cause of Christ,
        and also the church itself. Third, then, is the church flock which we must
        feed and nurture, love and guide. Fourth, our motive should be the
        blood of Christ~the high price He paid for the redemption of His church.</p>
      <p>Out of a sincere heart intimately acquainted with God must flow the
        work of the ministry. God must not just be known and studied, but
        experienced, before we are able to preach with the proper motivation.
        We must realize that God wants us to see through His eternal perspective,
        not <em>“read[ing] divinity like philosophers~as if it were a thing of no
        more moment than a lesson in music, or arithmetic, and not the doctrine
        of everlasting life!”</em></p>
      <p>In order, then, to make sure your motives for ministry are pleasing
        to God, take care to always preach your sermons to yourself before proclaiming
        them to your congregation. Let God work in your heart in the
        secret places, and take time to meditate on the change He wants to bring
        about in your own walk before you preach to your congregations about
        their walk.</p>
      <p>Also, search your heart to gauge your level of expectancy that God
        will do great things. How much are you depending on God to bring
        success to your ministry? Do you believe He is more than able to transform
        lives and save dying souls? Because, <em>“I have observed that God seldom
        blesses any man’s work if his heart is not set upon success.”</em></p>
      <p>To be successful, then, remember that many may come against you
        with harsh words, arrogance, and stubbornness. But never think this
        makes it permissible to use their weapons against them in an effort to
        protect yourself. God alone is your defender.</p>
      <table width="282" border="2" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="2" bordercolor="#660033">

            and not force against force.”</h1></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>      
      <p>Also, in striving to maintain the right motivations, be aware of the
        need for fellowship with other ministers. This is vital to sharpen one
      anothers’ gifts and encourage one anothers’ walk with God.</p>
      <p>And do not be afraid of discipline, for to neglect discipline in the
        church is a disgrace to God. It will mislead people in thinking they are
        Christians when, in fact, they are not. They treat sin with such indifference,
        as they do the Word of God, that for us as pastors to tolerate such behavior
        is to dishonor the cross of Christ!</p>
      <table width="277" height="131" border="2" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="2" bordercolor="#333300">

                that (1) to be Christian

                opinion or (2) the
                Christian religion

                holiness than the false
              religions of the world.”</h1>
          </div></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>      <p>Thus, the ministry should be
        accepted with zeal for its benefits,
        its challenges, and its necessity. We
        will have the opportunity of seeing
        the conversion of souls as we do
        personal ministry on a systematic
        basis. We will see those already
        firm in their faith become more
        grounded still. As we become more
        aware of personal needs in our congregations,
        our public preaching
        can be better understood. Members
        will be more confident to share
        with us their doubts and temptations
        so that we can help steer them
        in the most godly direction. Then
        we will be better able to pray for
        them. Our prayers can be specific,
        and we can also hold them accountable
        to resisting temptation.</p>
      <p>There are still several more
        benefits to being a pastor~showing
        the flock you tend to, for instance,
        what the real meaning of the pastoral
        office is. Ministering is not
        just about preaching, baptizing,
        administering the Lord’s Supper,
        and visiting the sick. It is far more~
        a building of true, edifying relationships
        between members of the
        Body of Christ. As people come
        to understand their pastor’s role
        better, they should begin to see
        themselves as students under his
        careful teaching, eager to learn
        more about the riches they have
        through salvation.</p>
      <p>Personal ministry is beneficial
        for the next generation as well, “to
        train them up in the way they should
        go.” In working with individuals
        now to correct false thinking and prioritize values, to repent of past mistakes, their children and their children’s
        children will reap the benefits of these biblical corrections in the
        future. It will also create a heightened level of respect for the Sabbath,
        when the heads of each household should take more responsibility in
        keeping the Lord’s Day holy.</p>
      <p>Also, by having proper motivations and ministering personally to people,
        we will pay closer attention to the allotment of time. There will be
        less time to perform duties, and thus there will be a dire need to structure
        our lives with discipline to avoid any idleness. We will not waste time involved
        in petty disagreements. As we take on these duties with proper
        motives, we will find ourselves becoming more like Christ and more heavenly
        minded. And this kind of personal ministry, if we maintain it, could
      very well bring about revival on a national scale.</p>
      <p>The difficulties of the ministry, then, are far fewer than the benefits.
        But one widely felt temptation is the one to please men rather than God.
        <em>“We would rather they go quietly to hell than to upset them. We are ready
  to venture on the displeasure of God rather than to bring forth the ill
  will of men.”</em></p>
      <p>Another unfortunate difficulty many pastors struggle with is <em>“foolish
  bashfulness.” </em>We are more ashamed of our God sometimes than we are
        of our own sin! Then there is the issue of our worldly pleasures and interests
        that can create impediments in serving God’s kingdom. But the
        greatest obstruction is purely our lack of faith! How can our congregations
        be built up into greater levels of faith when our own is so weak? This is
        why we must take such heed to the condition of our own hearts and
        ministries.</p>
      <p>In ourselves, we are unfit for ministry. But the good news remains
        that God is always fit for His own ministry in which He merely employs
        us as vessels.</p>
      <p>There is a necessity for pastoral ministry. Private studying, speaking
        as directly and clearly as we can, and personally getting to know each
        member of our congregations will make huge strides toward the magnificent
        work God wants to accomplish in this nation.</p>
      <h2><a name="5" id="5"></a>Practical Words of Wisdom for Pastoral Leadership </h2>
      <p><em>“It has been the whole vision of this book ... to teach the catechism~or
  basic tenets of the faith~to every family within the parish.”</em> Alert your
        members to the fact that you will be in their homes providing foundational
        instruction and giving them books to help them along in their walks with
        God. Let them know, also, that you do this, not because you merely feel
        like imposing authority over them, but because you have been called to
        do it. You have been <em>called</em> to lead them into God-mandated morality
        and guide them into a greater understanding of the blessing of their salvation.
        Whether they respect this authority you have been given or not,
      love them and be patient with them, because love is long-suffering.</p>
      <p>Once you start the process of ministering to each individual family in
        their own homes, then focus on your effectiveness in teaching. Make sure, first and foremost, that they
        know you want to spend time with
        them~that you are honored to be
        in the position you are and you are
        willing to do anything to help them
        understand the gospel better.</p>
      <p>After entering each home, pull
        individual members of each family
        into separate rooms so as to give
        the individual one-on-one time
        with you to be more vulnerable,
        ask more questions, and avoid possible
        embarrassment in front of
        other family members. Do this with
        caution and prudence, however.
        For instance, do not <em>“create unnecessary
        scandal by speaking to
        women on their own when it would
        be wiser to speak in the presence of
        others.” </em>You must be aware of such
        dynamics because, though they
        may seem insignificant in your
        mind and you may know you have
        pure motives, you must always be
        aware of the appearance of evil.</p>
      <table width="282" border="2" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="2" bordercolor="#660033">

      <p>So then, while meeting with
        individuals, discern how much they
        know of the basics of faith. Do they
        know the Ten Commandments,
        for instance? Do they understand
        the Apostle’s Creed? Then ask them
        more pointed doctrinal questions.
        What do they believe about an afterlife?
        Do they believe the afterlife
        even exists? What does salvation
        mean to them? What does sanctification
        mean, and how does that
        come about after a man is saved?
        If you see they are having difficulty
        answering, answer for them, and
      explain your biblical reasoning.</p>
      <p>Next, look into their specific
        life situations, their needs, and their
        character. Sensitively inquire into
        their personal lives, in the most
        tactful way, and seek to perceive
        by the power of the Holy Spirit
        whether they are truly converted
        to Christ. If you are convinced that they are still unsaved, then use all the boldness and the skill you possess
        to help them understand their heart’s condition. Liken yourself to a sick
        man who was in need of Christ as the Great Physician to save you through
        His grace. You chose to receive His offer of help. Now they need to
        choose the same. Do all this while humbly realizing that it is only the
        Holy Spirit who does the transforming work of the soul.</p>
      <p>Encourage your congregants to change their old habits as well. To
        do that, advise building new friendships with those who will edify them
        in their faith and push them closer to Christ. Before you leave them, tell
        them that you hope you have not offended them. Show them that you
        feel as awkward, perhaps, in pushing them as they do in being challenged.
        Then make sure the heads of each home are taking responsibility to lead
        spiritually, as you may not be able to return to that home for a while.
        Take notes about each individual: <em>“their personal responses, their own
        private spiritual condition, and their needs.”</em></p>
      <p>Remember as well that different people and different personalities require
        different approaches in communication. <em>“To the young, lay more
        stress on the enticements of sensual pleasures and of the great need to
        have control over their passions .... to the old, be respectful. To the rich,
        preach self-denial and the deceitfulness of prosperity. To the poor, show
        the glory of the Gospel.”</em></p>

        taking groups of families and friends together is better than hastily rushing
        through each individual meeting and giving the impression that you do
      not have enough time for them.</p>

      <p>Our ultimate responsibility, then, is to the health of the church as a

        anyone in particular, preach on
        those truths without bias but with
        solid conviction from scriptural
        evidence. Let your members know
        they can ask you any questions, no
        matter how great their doubt may
      be, and you will be glad to answer.</p>
      <p>Also be aware of the lukewarm
        Christians and deal with them delicately
        as well. However, do not be
        afraid to be direct while still being
        sensitive. Tell them how concerned
        you are that they seem to take their
        salvation so lightly. Provide the
        necessary counsel, while at the same
        time being cautious not to judge
        them prematurely, for it is not a
        small thing to discern a person’s
        salvation. Then direct them into
        daily devotions, solid friendships,
        and honoring the Sabbath, while
        maintaining a personal closeness
        to them so that you can lend assistance
        to them as they fight their
        specific temptations and pitfalls.</p>
      <p>In all of this, never forget to
        employ the God-given gifts of the
        laymen.</p>

      <p>Encourage laymen in their strengths. Ask them to visit the poor and
        the sick. Invite them to uplift the downtrodden. Admonish them to teach
        and guide their families in the ways of God. Show them how to evangelize
        those who do not understand salvation and guide them in representing
        Christ with brotherly love to their fellow believers. Ask them to pray in
        public meetings and always encourage their private prayer lives as the
        most powerful strategy for effective ministry and, ultimately, for true relationship
        with our Savior. Appoint deacons to aid you in discipline and
        in delegation of church duties and, in doing so, verbally recognize the
        qualities in each leader that gave you the desire to put them into their
      positions of leadership.</p>
      <p>In these ways, you will build your congregation to be steady and
        strong, build them into believers who know the Word of God and know
        the God of the Word and who serve Him wholeheartedly.</p>

       <p>The author: Richard Baxter (1615-1691)
         was a pastor caught in the crossfire of reformation
         and Puritan control in seventeenth
         century England. Baxter was ordained into
         the Church of England in 1638 after studying
         divinity. Within two years, however, he
         had allied himself with Puritans in opposition
         to the episcopacy established by his
         church. He was a peacemaker who sought
         unity among Protestants, and yet he was a
         highly independent thinker and at the center
         of every major controversy in England during
         his lifetime. Baxter was an advocate of
         ecumenism and the author of more than
         160 books.</p>
