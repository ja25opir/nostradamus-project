<font size="4">A Butter Patty from: <img src="../pics/doc.jpg"><br> on Sunday, November 01, 1998 at 09:56:59 (PST) <br>You should look at <a href="http://www.denizine.com/columnist/doc/103098.htm">this</a>

<b>STATE OF THE SERVER ADDRESS
<br>From your ever-beloved founder, Doc
<br>
<br>Dear Fellow Inmates,
<br>The <a href="http://www.amishrakefight.org">amishrakefight.org</a> server is going through some changes I thought you should know about.
<br>Our web hosting company, <a href="http://www.best.com">Best Internet</a>, allows an almost-unprecedented 200 MB/day of traffic (downloads). Most web hosts only allow, at most, a tenth of that. Lately, we have been hovering at about 50% of that capacity. Just six months ago, 10% was typical. This means that it won't be long until we "hit the wall" traffic-wise. I'll try to explain what happens when we top out: Best Internet resets the capacity figure at the top of every hour. Their <a href="http://shell2.ba.best.com/usage.cgi?name=amish">bandwidth counter</a>, each hour, looks back over the last 24 hours. Once it sees 200 MB has been used over that period, it "shuts down" the domain until the top of the hour. This means, for example, that visitors arriving at 5 minutes 'til the top of the hour may get sent to a <a href="http://www.amishrakefight.org/limit.html">page</a> explaining that the bandwidth limit has been reached, and are asked to try again after the top of the hour.
<br>Once that starts happening, we will have to look into taking some stuff
 off the server. But don't worry -- there is plenty of stuff you don't know
 about that can be removed without affecting the truly Amish portion of the
 server. I have <a href="http://www.amishrakefight.org/docmusic.html">four
 songs of my own</a> in MP3 format on the server that eat up quite a bit of
 bandwidth on a daily basis, for example, which could be moved.
<br>Currently, however, the page generating all the traffic is the <a href="http://www.amishrakefight.org/gfy">Go Fuck Yourself Home Page</a>. My web analysis software shows that the <a href="http://www.amishrakefight.org/gfy">GFY</a> page is now getting 800-900 hits a day. About two-thirds of the visitors are running Java, and thus downloading the audio portion of the page, fyfyfyfy.au. The downloading of that audio snippet alone is accounting for about 20% of the traffic!
<br>Somehow, the <a href="http://www.amishrakefight.org">Amish Rake Fight Home Page</a> is getting around 200 hits a day now. I am at a loss to explain why. But we are eligible for a higher grade of sponsorship for our site that we are currently getting. So I have applied to <a href="http://www.valueclick.com">ValueClick</a> to put their ads on our pages. Our current sponsor, <a href="http://www.momentumplus.com/media/">Momentum Plus</a>, tends to put up banners for boring products, about half of which are aimed at Asian markets. As a result, we have earned only about $15 all year, despite some 5 banners spread over two domains (<a href="http://www.nwlaser.com/wavs">Doc's Chat Sounds</a> has been carrying the same banners).
<br>If we qualify with <a href="http://www.valueclick.com">ValueClick</a>, we would be getting not only better banners, but 15 cents per click-through rather than the 5 cents we are getting with <a href="http://www.momentumplus.com/media/">Momentum Plus</a>. I should be hearing back from <a href="http://www.valueclick.com">ValueClick</a> within a week or so. 
<br>So, in conclusion, keep an eye out for the new banners, and <a href="mailto: limit@nwlaser.com">e-mail</a> me if you get shut out of the server due to high traffic.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Doc</b><br>

web page.<br><br>
<b>Well, I just got done watching Deep Impact, that recently-released-on-video action-thriller about a big ol' comet giving the Earth a whack. It turned out to be most educational. Here's what I learned:
<br>
<br>ð When you fall asleep watching a movie, then go back later and watch the part you missed, you may well find that sleep was your brain's way of saying "Enough already!"
<br>
<br>ð The chances of a comet striking the Earth are so small that we'd be more likely to elect a black president.
<br>
<br>ð Any attempts at blowing up a comet before it can get us will likely yield the following results:
<br>1) By drilling deep holes in the comet and setting off a-bombs, we'll only succeed in breaking the comet in two.
<br>2) However, we'll have enough nukes left on the spaceship after the first attempt that we can just drive head-on into the thing, destroying it entirely.
<br>
<br>ð The government is building a cave with accomodations for 1 million people just in case a comet hits us.
<br>
<br>ð We won't be able to predict exactly where the comet will strike, so everybody will just stay put until it hits.
<br>
<br>ð You can outrun a 700-foot-tall tidal wave; if you have a motorcycle, you've got it made.
<br>
<br>ð In the traffic jams preceding the disaster, everyone will leave 20 feet of space around their cars, and there will be no panic or horn-honking.
<br>
<br>ð Any comet that slams the Earth will land in the Atlantic, thus saving our precious film industry.
<br>
<br>ð Even Robert Duvall makes a bad decision now and then.
<br>
<br>Happy viewing, and if you figure out what any of the sub-plots were all about, please write me.
<br>
<br>Doc</b><br>

<br>
<br>1) <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> is kicking ass again.
<br>
<br>2) Quoting from the <a href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/nuke/info.html">Nuke Information Page</a> listed above: "Macintosh users should rejoice - unlike bug-riddled Windows, MacOS is impervious to most attacks. Be sure you're using OpenTransport (not MacTCP) under MacOS 8.x and you should be safe."
<br>
<br>3) <a href="http://www.ircle.com">Ircle 3.0</a> is out of alpha/beta
for
the first time in its history! Mac users should <a href="http://www.ircle.com/download.html">download version 3.0.1</a>.

<br>Abner reached out and stroked the glass of the display case almost involuntarily, his fingertips idly moving against the glass as his mouth fell into a gentle "O". Sure, Grandpa had warned him about the temptations of the big city, but Abner wouldn't listen, had to go see for himself. 
<br>
<br>Now, as he stared wide-eyed at the array of exotic colors and mysterious devices before him, he knew he had no power over the emotions flooding over him like a tidal wave of reckless need. His face flushed and a thin trickle of sweat rolled from under his straw hat. He unbuttoned his collar, something his Grandma would have thwacked him in the head with a thimbled middle finger for at home. 
<br>
<br>As his eyes roved back and forth over the contents of the display case, he could almost hear all the voices of his family calling out to him, warning him away, but it was lost to the terrible roar of a 16-year-old Amish boy's raging hormones and the object of those hormone's desires, right there on the other side of the glass.
<br>
<br>The clerk finally finished with the customer before Abner. He approached the trembling blonde boy who wore awkward black pants, a white shirt, worn heavy shoes, straw hat and wide black suspenders. "Can I help you?" He asked.
<br>
<br>The boy couldn't speak, so red-faced and agitated, he could only point at one particular item. 
<br>
<br>"Ah, yes" the clerk said as he slid back the door of the display case and removed the item, and then set it down on the countertop, right in front of Abner's steaming eyes. "This is a big favorite. That's real leather there, pal. Here, feel it." 
<br>
<br>He handed it to Abner.

<b>At Thanksgiving yesterday, I got my dad's take on the imminent Y2K crisis.  Based on what he's heard on TV, he seems to think that life as we know it will come to a screetching halt.  The wheels on the wagon we call Mother Earth will come off and we will be back to stone tablet and chisels.  I'm in the market for a cheap computer as a Christmas present for them.  I'm considering making a "Y2K Compliant" sticker and slapping it on the the box, so that they can rest assured that it won't burn the house down at the dawn of the new millenium. </b><br>

Sure, there's lots of ways to fix the problem, but none to create it deliberately. I've already got a bag of marshmallows and a good stick so I can make smores while I enjoy this kerosene-powered P100's conflagration (which I intend to dedicate to MS' legal dept., just in case.)

<br>I'm hoping that it may somehow transport me back to Jan. 1, 1900 so I can warn Teddy Roosevelt about Bill Gates buying the state of Washington someday. Maybe he'll pause from killing Spaniards long enough to enact a special abortion law just for Bill.
