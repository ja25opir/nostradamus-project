mammoth, one of the largest animals that lived thousands of years ago</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">writes Mike Pitts </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thursday October 3, 2002</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Guardian </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In a store in Wandsworth, south London, 
are 10 tonnes of 750,000-year-old Norfolk. "If you could go back 750,000 years," 
says palaeontologist Tony Stuart, "you'd look at the plants and animals and 
think you were in a familiar place. Then odd things would happen. Perhaps you'd 
see a macaque monkey. An elephant would wander past." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Stuart, now at University College 
London, was on the team that excavated a giant mammoth 10 years ago at West 
Runton, Norfolk. The peaty earth around the bones is still awaiting study in the 
Natural History Museum store, but the mammoth is the best preserved specimen of 
Mammuthus trogontherii in the world, a huge beast that is twice as heavy as a 
modern African elephant. The Norfolk animal had been scavenged: 20 hyena turds 
still glistened beside the chewed bones. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologists now believe humans were 
present in southern England not long after. Could they have hunted elephants? 
The question has arisen with the completion of another Norfolk dig, at Lynford, 
near Thetford. Here, Stuart has identified the remains of at least nine woolly 
mammoths, or Mammuthus primigenius, a more manageable size of roughly an African 
elephant. Although there are no human fossils, there are 44 pristine flint 
handaxes. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Lynford dates to a mere 60,000 years 
ago, so the tool makers would have been Neanderthals. Mark White, an 
archaeologist at Durham University, is convinced they were using the flints to 
butcher the mammoths. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The flints show that the Neanderthals 
were bringing to the site ready-made blanks, which they then turned into sharp 
knives. White thinks this means they knew there would be mammoths there. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There are two flint blanks they did not 
use. "One is like a thick slice of salami. The angles are all wrong: you could 
never make a handaxe with it. The other has a flaw in the flint," he says. 
"These were very skilled creatures." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Danielle Schreve, palaeontologist at 
Royal Holloway College, London, however, is not ready to say whether the 
handaxes were used to butcher the mammoths. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It could be difficult to prove either 
way. No cuts on the bones have been found, but experiments with modern elephants 
show that butchery does not always mark bones. The Lynford remains have been 
heavily smashed up. Stuart says this may have been done partly by hyenas. But he 
thinks the Neanderthals were there, too, extracting the bone marrow. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"They were working hard to get 
everything out of them," he says. "This would be more consistent with scavenging 
than hunting." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Both digs are exciting because of the 
wealth of information about the ancient environments. At Lynford, 150 species of 
insect have been identified. These indicate the presence of standing water, 
marsh, bare sand and grass. Dung and carcass beetles add to the picture of giant 
rotting mammals being scavenged by hyenas and Neanderthals. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The climate was warmer at the more 
ancient West Runton. Fruits, seeds and pollen indicate temperate forest, quite 
different from the cold open spaces at Lynford. A list of creatures found from 
the remains includes pike and perch, newts, frogs, beavers and an extinct otter, 
hamsters, bison, a small extinct rhino, wolves and an extinct giant elk. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The animal that most catches the 
imagination, however, is the mammoth. "We are left with the two modern ones," 
says Stuart, "but there were loads of different kinds of elephant." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The woolly mammoth is the best known, 
famous for its warm coat of long hair. No skin or hair survives at Lynford, but 
a few hairy mammoths have been found frozen in Siberia. Cave paintings in France 
and Spain confirm that European mammoths were woolly. And small-eared. Thought 
to be part of the African elephant's cooling system, large ears could have been 
death to mammoths rooting for grass under snow drifts. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is the woolly mammoth that will walk 
across our television screens tonight, digitally reconstructed for the first 
film in a series about American wildlife 13,000 years ago - when many 
archaeologists believe the first humans reached America. "Just a few hundred 
generations ago," says series producer Miles Barton, "people met these almost 
mythical animals." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Which is what, in a manner of speaking, 
a group of archaeologists did this summer in Norfolk. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The exact location has been kept secret

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The site is atop the Mittelberg, a 252m 
hill in the Ziegelroda Forest, 180km south-west of Berlin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adding a spooky touch is the discovery 
that, seen from the Mittelberg, the sun sets every June 22 behind the Brocken, 
the highest mountain in northern Germany. The Brocken is in a direct line of 
sight on a clear day, 85km to the north-west.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

representation of the stars in the world, was placed in a pit in the middle of a 
ringwall during the early Bronze Age," Harald Meller, the chied archaeologist in 
the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We still don't know if it was a 
princely grave or a treasure store for holy objects."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On Wednesday reporters were shown a 
clearing where the archaeological dig had gone down about half a metre into the 
soil, leaving what appeared to be loose stone walls standing. The site was once 
surrounded by wooden palisades and a complex of defensive ditches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Wolfhard Schlosser, an expert in ancient 
astronomy at the University of the Ruhr, added, "The ringwall was built in such 
a way that the sun seemed to disappear every equinox behind the Brocken."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Experts believe the map and site formed 
an observatory, which was used to set the calendar for planting and harvesting

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The nearby forest contains 1 000 barrows

people, who are not mentioned in ancient Greek or other Mediterranean sources.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meller said two bronze swords found at 
the site had been made with a technique unique to Mycenaean and Anatolian 
swords, and had a similar shape to arms found in modern Romania and Hungary. The 
site is to become a tourist attraction when the dig finishes in a year or two. -

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 16.0pt">Saqqara 
finds laid bare </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On a mound just a kilometre northwest of 
the Serapeum at Saqqara, a mission from the Japanese Institute of Egyptology at 
Waseda University has made two significant discoveries. Nevine El-Aref visits 
the site </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Japanese team working at Saqqara has 
made a major discovery -- the remains of a huge limestone stepped structure, 
about 4.5 metres in height and 33.5 metres in length. It has also found a deep 
shaft leading to two chambers containing a number of objects. These include a 
wooden statue of a well- endowed female which Zahi Hawass, secretary-general of 
the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) describes as "a magnificent piece". She 
is glazed with resin, while her eyes are inlaid with bronze. Together, the new 
discoveries reaffirm the wealth of objects that as yet lie undetected on the 
Saqqara plateau. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The first discovery, a wall of an early 
stepped construction, reveals the structural technique used on the necropolis in 
early times. It is an example of the tiered, inward- sloping masonry of the 
earliest stone architectural forms in ancient Egypt. Unfortunately, in 
successive dynasties the structure was used as a stone quarry. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However Nozomu Kawai, field director of 
the Abusir and Saqqara project, described the remaining wall as comprising 15 
rows of limestone blocks, each block approximately 30cms high. "The central 
trench of the structure was dug near the middle of the wall towards the south," 
Kawai said. "This was perpendicular to the main wall of the monument." </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">While layers of accumulated earth were 
being removed from the trench, revealing its stratigraphy, pottery was unearthed 
which can be dated with certainty to between the second and fourth dynasties. 
"It is similar to that described in the excavation report of the Step Pyramid of 
the Pharaoh Djoser written by Egyptologist Jean Philip Lauer," Kawai said. He 
added that the upper layer contained hundreds of miniature pieces of pottery of 
Middle Kingdom date. "It suggests some kind of offering activities at that 
time," he said </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In addition, a T-shaped shaft was found 
leading to two chambers on the north and south respectively. "The north chamber 
was intact, with its sealing stone in place as on the day of completion," Hawass 
said. "It was inserted on the top of the shaft and was reminiscent of sealing 
stones common from the late Early Dynastic Period, before the beginning of the 
Old Kingdom." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However the sealing system of the south 
chamber, which had already been penetrated, proved to be dissimilar. It was made 
of rows of limestone blocks covered with gypsum and plaster. Sakuji Yoshimura, 
director-general of the Institute of Egyptology at Waseda University, said the 
chamber consisted of a long, rectangular room decorated with two niches. "One 
was empty while the other seems to have been decorated with an unfinished work 
of art," he said. "Some Middle Kingdom pottery in good condition was unearthed 
inside this chamber, and is similar to pottery previously found in the Middle 
Kingdom pyramid complex of Sesostris I at Lisht." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was in the intact north chamber that 
the Japanese mission made important discoveries. When they entered the 
rectangular chamber, which has a doorway and a rectangular break at its north 
eastern end, they dug a small trench near the chamber's sealing stone and were 
delighted to come upon a number of small objects including an ivory statue of 
female figure which drew considerable attention. "The woman wears a sheath, her 
legs are carved together, and she wears an unusual wig similar to that worn by 
archaic royal female statues," Kawai said. He described the piece as 
proportionately well balanced. The statue was found nestled in a layer of sand 
beneath rock collapsed from the ceiling of the chamber. "It may have been 
brought to this location from somewhere else, since most of the other objects in 
the chamber date to a later period," Kawai said. The date of the statue has not 
been determined. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Other objects found in the northern 
chamber include fragments of a wooden statue and two faience plaques, one 
decorated with a depiction of Anubis and the second with geometrical drawings.

Archaeologists win battle over Marathon</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">GREEK archaeologists have won a partial 
victory in their efforts to prevent a new Olympic rowing and sailing centre 
disturbing an ancient settlement on the site of the Battle of Marathon. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Greek Government has agreed to 
dismantle the remains of three 4,500-year-old Neolithic homes, unearthed two 
months ago, and move them 50 yards. The decision was a retreat by Evangelos 
Venizelos, the Minister for Culture, who had played down the importance of the 
find. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Under pressure from the influential 
Central Archaeological Council, Mr Venizelos agreed to delay work on the seaside 
rowing and sailing centre, which is planned for the 2004 Olympic Games. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Moving the buildings will be a 
painstaking and risky operation, in which steel girders are inserted under the 
foundations to take the weight of the stones. The girders will be moved along 
rails, carrying the intact structure. The technique has been employed 
successfully in the past. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr Venizelos’s decision to locate the 
rowing and sailing centre at Schinias Beach, 25 miles northeast of Athens, had 
been controversial from the beginning. The beach is the site of the opening and 
closing stages of the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, when Athenian troops beat 
off a larger force of Persian invaders. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeologists and environmentalists had 
joined forces to oppose the decision, hoping to preserve both the olive 
tree-studded battlefield and the adjacent wetland that is home to pelicans and a 
rare species of pine tree. The newly found ruins were already 2,000 years old 
when the battle took place. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr Venizelos, who has continued lobbying 
for the return of the Elgin Marbles, says that in ancient times much of where 
the rowing and sailing centre is now being built was under the sea and thus 
nobody could have fought a battle at that spot. But Kathimerini newspaper said 
he had “failed to convincingly defend his main argument”. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Antonios Psilovikos, a geologist at 
Salonika University, claims that he has established, “without any doubt 
whatsoever”, that the site was was a freshwater swamp and lagoon. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to Herodotus, the main source 
for the battle, many Persians perished in that swamp, chased into it by the 
victorious Athenian army. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The International Olympic Committee has 
preferred to stay out of the controversy. Denis Oswald, the IOC co-ordinator for 
the 2004 Athens Games, said recently that he did not believe the Neolithic homes 
preservation project would significantly hold up work on the rowing and sailing 
centre, as only a small section near the starting area would be affected.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The complex development of the city of 
Zippori during the third century, the period of Roman rule, is apparent from the 
wealth of elaborate public and private buildings and colonnaded streets 
excavated in previous seasons. Ancient Zippori (Sepphoris), west of Nazareth in

back to both the Roman and Byzantine periods, including the 
internationally-heralded, breathtakingly beautiful ''Madonna of the Galilee,'' 
as it is known.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Now the first evidence of Jewish farms 
dating back to the third century are being uncovered. The excavations, conducted 
under the auspices of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Institute of 
Archaeology, have revealed five rooms of a two-storey stone farmhouse complex 
built around a central courtyard, as well as a possible wine press, storage 
vessels, household and farm utensils. Most important was the discovery of a 
large, decorated, limestone vessel, the type used by Jewish priests in Jerusalem 
and the Galilee for storing ''purified'' water used.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The world’s most famous Georgian 
warship, HMS Victory, has had most of her timber replaced since the Battle of 
Trafalgar, with the keel and the lower gun deck the main areas that remain.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">HMS Unicorn is fighting for lottery 
funding against the Royal Research Ship Discovery, the vessel used by Captain 
Scott for his expedition to Antarctica, which is berthed further up the Tay.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although Discovery is more famous, 
experts claim the Unicorn is the more important from a historical point of view.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Derek Sinclair, of Abertay 
University’s Scottish Institute of Wood Technology, has worked on most of 
Britain’s great wooden sailing ships. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He warned that HMS Unicorn is in danger 
of becoming a "death trap". "Unless action is taken within the next five years 
and unless the ship is dry-docked within the next 10 years, it will be 
effectively gone. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Because the vessel is unique and is the 
only intact survivor of the period of transition from wood and canvas to steam 
and iron, we would be looking at dismantling sections of it for conservation and 
display in a museum and that would be a tragic waste. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Another alternative would be to sink 
the ship and preserve it in water although this is unlikely with the Unicorn and 
the danger is that the ship would never be likely to be raised again. Either 
solution would be a tragedy and an absolute waste. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Other vessels in Britain, which have 
nothing like the scientific significance of the Unicorn, have received Heritage 
Lottery funding. And the Discovery is just an old Dundee whaler and not in the 
same league as the Unicorn in terms of its historical importance." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">However, the Discovery attracted 72,000 
visitors last year compared with the 8,000 who came to see the Unicorn and the 
more venerable vessel is firmly in the shadow of its glamorous neighbour. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Discovery benefits from its romantic 
association with Captain Robert Falcon Scott and is fully rigged unlike its ugly 
sister. But the Discovery is leaking too and requires £1.6m of conservation 
work, much of it to come, it is hoped, from the same Heritage Lottery Fund.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Undaunted, the supporters of the Unicorn 
Preservation Society, which has cared for the Unicorn for the past 35 years and 
whose past patrons included the late Queen Mother, are launching a major appeal 
to raise £4.4m to build a covered dry dock to house and preserve the ship.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They are anxious that Unicorn should 
avoid the fate of the 140 year-old Carrick, the world’s oldest clipper which was 
a well-known landmark on the Clyde in Glasgow before languishing on an Ayrshire 
slipway for years. Despite a campaign to save her, she is still languishing in 
Irvine after the Scottish maritime museum failed to raise the £5.5m needed to 
renovate her. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Roderick Stewart is heading the Unicorn 
Preservation Society’s ‘Operation Unicorn’ fund-raising initiative and is 
adamant that if sufficient money is not raised to put the plans into practice 
the Unicorn will also be lost to Scotland forever. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He said: "We have a bid in with the 
Heritage Lottery Fund at the moment and if it doesn’t come through then we will 
have to think seriously about the ship’s future. They are coming to see us next 
month and so far we have been encouraged by their response, but if that comes 
off it will only be a percentage of the cash and we also need local people and 
businesses to back the project. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Visitor figures are not good enough, 
which is annoying because when people come down here they really love it, in 
fact, many of them say it is better than the Discovery, but people have to wake 
up to the fact that the ship will not be here if they don’t come and visit."
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">THE Unicorn is not the only one of 
Scotland’s maritime treasures in danger of rotting away. Concerns have been 
raised about the world’s oldest clipper ship, the Carrick - City of Adelaide 
(above), which is in a dry-dock in Irvine, and Leith-based SS Explorer, the last 
steam trawler of its kind to be built in Scotland. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Carrick faces being destroyed 
because no money is available to restore her. Campaigners have been frustrated 
in their attempts to get lottery cash because of bureaucracy and disputes over 
responsibility for maritime heritage. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Volunteers have been working to save the 
SS Explorer, and are trying to raise £100,000 to restore the vessel.</span></p>

excavating 1884 steamboat wreck</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Archaeology students are unloading 
secrets from the largest steamboat to ply the Missouri River. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This week, a field school for budding 
underwater archaeologists began excavating the wreck of a large stern-wheeler, 
believed to be the steamboat Montana. The Montana was the largest ever to travel 
the waters of the Missouri River, the archaeologists say. It now rests on the 
riverbank in Bridgeton, just south of the Highway 370 Discovery Bridge. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The boat's remains are revealing 
surprises about the state of technology during the last days of glory for river 
steamboats and may serve as a blueprint for rethinking the history of paddle 
wheel boats. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"We will literally be rewriting the book 
on how these steamers were constructed from this one project," said Bradley 
Rodgers, an archaeologist from East Carolina State University. Rodgers 
co-directs the field school with Annalies Corbin, a maritime archaeologist who 
studies steamboat transportation in the West. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Corbin and Rodgers brought a group of 
seven students to document the shipwreck on behalf of the Missouri Department of 
Natural Resources State Historic Preservation Office. The exercise is the 
state's first scientific exploration of a shipwreck. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The steamboat is an irreplaceable state 
resource, said archaeologist Steve J. Dasovitch of SCI Engineering Inc., a St. 
Charles-based company hired to monitor the wreckage for the state. Once the 
students finish excavating and mapping the wreck, they will fill the site back 
in with Missouri River mud, preserving it for the state. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The wreckage offers some glimpses of the 
day when every cargo company hoping to sell its goods to settlers in the West 
sent wares via paddle-wheelers through St. Louis, he said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"St. Louis serving as a gateway to the 
West isn't just a figure of speech," Dasovitch said. "The Missouri River was the 
major highway for westward expansion. It outshines all the major trails." </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And the steamboat Montana was the last 
shining example of the river vessels that carried people and freight west before 
the railroads became the primary mode of transportation, said Corbin. The boat 
was built in 1879 as part of a trio for Coulson and Co., a Yankton, S.D., 
freight company. The Montana and its sisters, the Wyoming and the Dakota, 
represented the pinnacle of steamboat technology for the day, Corbin said.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The boat measured 250 feet from stem to 
stern - 280 feet with its giant paddle wheel - dwarfing most of the 120-foot to 
140-foot boats on the river, she said. The Montana's three decks, pilot house 
and smoke stacks would have given her a height of more than 50 feet, Corbin 
said. She was as wide as she was tall. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But her stature may have been the 
Montana's downfall. In June 1884, the steamboat tried to pass under a railroad 
bridge spanning the Missouri River between St. Charles and Bridgeton. The boat 
went out of control and steamed bow-first into the bridge, took on water and ran 
aground on the St. Louis County side of the river. The boat's bow broke under 
the weight of the water and the hogging chains that kept the Montana's spine in 
line could not support the weight of the ship and up to 600 tons of cargo. The 
Montana split in half, her starboard side sagging into the swollen river. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">She was not the only victim. "This 
bridge took out five to eight steamboats all by itself," Dasovitch said. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Now the once-mighty steam vessel is a 
collection of weathered timbers and rusted fixtures rising from the sucking 
black clay of the Missouri's shallow bank. Her severed deck beams jut from the 
muddy water - vertebrae of the Montana's split spine. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Treasure seekers still loot the wreck 
for anything of value, despite the fact that the boat's cargo, engines and 
boilers were salvaged at the time of the accident - leaving nothing of 
significance for collectors or treasure hunters, Dasovitch said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"People are always looking for that last 
gold coin," he said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Looters have done major damage to the 
site, cutting off pieces of timber and digging trenches inside the wreck, 
Dasovitch said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But the Montana still holds perhaps her 
greatest treasure - the secret of her construction. The Coulson company's 
documents were lost in the early part of the 20th century and most shipbuilders 
of the day didn't keep written accounts of their designs, Corbin said. The only 
record of the Montana's design is the boat itself. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On Wednesday, the crew, led by graduate 
student Chris Valvano, dug into the thick mud behind the boat, expecting to see 
the flat-bottom hull of a barge. Instead, an elegant arch curved downward 
through the sediment. The hollowed-out curve is a design element with a rather 
ungraceful name - a skeg. The archaeologists had never seen such an elaborate 
design on a wooden vessel, Rodgers said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Skegs didn't become common for at least 
20 years after the Montana was built, he said. The design accompanied the advent 
of metal hulls and propellers - the skeg provided sort of an alcove for the 
propellers, he said. Most design experts didn't think such a design was even 
possible with a wooden vessel, Rodgers said. The sharp angles could cause the 
wood to break, he said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But the Montana's builders spared no 
expense in her construction - the boat cost $54,000 in 1879, equivalent to more 
than $900,000 today - fortifying the fragile timber with iron fasteners, Rodgers 
said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The archaeologists may have only 
discovered the structural secret because half of the wreck is above water, 
Corbin said. Divers feeling their way through murky water almost certainly would 
not have been able to move the thick mud away from the rudder sheltering the 
skeg, she said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It's stunning all the way around," she 
said. </span></p>
