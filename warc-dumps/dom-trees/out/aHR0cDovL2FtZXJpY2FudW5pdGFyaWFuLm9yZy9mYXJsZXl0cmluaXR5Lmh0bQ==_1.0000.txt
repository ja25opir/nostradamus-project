        <td valign="top" width="87%" bgcolor="#ffffff">IF any doctrine can be
          called fundamental to Revealed Religion, it must be that of the
          strict, simple, unqualified Unity of God. I take this to be
          universally admitted, nay, insisted on. There is not a more obvious
          truth in the Scriptures; none more coincident with their whole tenor
          and drift, or with their most express and positive declarations.
          Rightly interpreted, rightly understood, there is not even an
          intimation or hint of any thing else. The language of the Bible upon
          this point is every where plain and explicit.
          <p>The declaration recorded in the fourth verse of the sixth chapter
          of Deuteronomy, then so solemnly made to the people of Israel through
          Moses; and afterwards in the coming in of the new and better
          dispensation, quoted and so emphatically affirmed by our Lord Jesus
          Christ in the twenty-ninth verse of the twelfth chapter of St. Mark's
          Gospel - "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord" - is
          clear and indisputable. Unitarians, therefore, not only without
          hesitation, but in perfect harmony with the unambiguous language of
          Scripture, - and on the express authority of Christ himself, affirm
          that God is ONE; in the strictest meaning of the word, ONE; One
          Person, One Being, One intelligent, conscious Mind. There are
          seventeen texts in the New Testament alone, in which He is expressly
          called the One or Only God. In thirteen hundred passages the word God
          occurs; in not one of them is there any necessary implication, but
          directly the contrary, of a plurality of Persons in the Godhead. In
          but very few of them has it ever been pretended that such a plurality
          is even implied.</p>
          <p>Indeed, I know not, had the sacred writers proposed to guard
          against any different belief from that of the simple Unity of God, how
          their testimony on this point could have been more express. Besides
          the citation just made from one of the Gospels, St. Paul, in the
          eighth chapter of his first Epistle to the Corinthians, having
          declared that "there is none other God but One," in the same
          breath adds, "to us there is One God, the Father" -- to us,
          Christians, that One God is the Father. So in the fourth chapter of
          his Epistle to the Ephesians he says: "There is One God and
          Father of all, who is above all." In perfect correspondence with
          all this, we find in the nineteenth chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel
          that our Lord, when a man addressed him with the words "Good
          Master," declined the epithet; saying: "Why callest thou me
          good? There is none Good but One, that is, God." Thus clearly is
          the fact that God is One, strictly and only One, stated in Scripture.
          But that this One God is the Father -- in other words, that the
          Father, and the Father only, is this One God, is just as clear. The
          beloved Apostle John has recorded at length a most remarkable prayer,
          offered by our Lord when he was about to leave the world. If he would
          ever have spoken simply, unequivocally, according to his convictions,
          nay, his knowledge, it must have been at that solemn hour, in that
          most solemn act. Hear him, then, addressing the FATHER: "This is
          Life Eternal, that they might know THEE, the ONLY TRUE GOD -- and
          Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent."</p>
          <p>Could any language be more explicit than this? Omniscience is an
          attribute essential to Supreme Deity; but to this, Christ not only
          makes no pretensions, he disclaims it in an emphatic manner when he
          says: "Of that day and that hour knoweth no man; no, not the
          angels who are in heaven; neither the Son; but the Father." In
          the parallel passage in Matthew he says most expressly, "but my
          Father ONLY." No resort can here be had, as has been attempted by
          Trinitarians, to their favorite hypothesis - that merest hypothesis,
          that shallowest assumption, as I hope hereafter to show -- namely, the
          Double Nature, or, as it is technically and theologically called, the
          Hypostatic Union; according to which Christ is both God and man.</p>
          <p>Whenever attempted, the conclusion has been only the more palpably
          impotent. The obvious difficulty of the text, on the supposition of
          the truth of the doc trine of the Trinity, cannot be overcome "by
          supposing that our Lord spake of himself here only as a man." For
          as the orthodox Macknight says: "The name Father following that
          of Son, shows that he spake of himself as the Son of God, and not as
          the Son of man. Besides, the gradation in the sentence seems to forbid
          this solution. For the Son being mentioned after the angels, and
          immediately before the Father, is thereby declared to be more
          excellent than they, which he is not in respect of his human nature;
          and therefore he cannot be supposed to speak of himself in that
          nature."</p>
          <p>Macknight here recognizes the ordinary Trinitarian idea, that the
          phrase or title "Son of God" implies the Divine Nature of
          our Lord, as "Son of Man" his Human Nature. Suppose, then,
          that our Lord was conscious of being possessed of this Double Nature;
          and that he actually meant what Trinitarians say he meant, that as
          "Son of God" he was God the Son, the second Person of the
          Godhead, and that as "Son of Man" he was indeed "the
          man," preeminently the man, but nevertheless man only, having, as
          they often allege, a human body and a human soul; how stands the case?
          Assuredly, his language, as recorded by St. Mark, must then be
          understood to admit, nay, with emphasis to declare his ignorance both
          as man and as God, both in his human and in his divine nature,
          "of that day and hour." If ignorant in that respect, if
          ignorant on any one, and but one point, he was not Omniscient. And I
          cannot help adding, though not discussing that topic now, that if in
          his divine nature, if as God the Son, he was not Omniscient, then
          that; divine nature was not the highest; then, as God the Son he was
          not the Supreme; he was God only in an inferior and subordinate sense,
          or as he himself, on another occasion, expressed it, as being one
          "to whom the word of God came." The argument is not weakened
          by reading "no one" instead of "no man" in the
          first clause, as the Greek might at least with equal correctness be
          rendered. For the words "the Son" are still there; they
          still stand in full force, used by Christ himself to distinguish
          himself from the Father, whom he describes as "the ONLY TRUE
          GOD"; while the expression "no one" is so sweeping of
          itself as to carry with it all other beings, even if none of them were
          specified, and unless some were excepted. One glorious exception, as
          we have seen, is made- "the Father only." The Father alone
          being Omniscient, is GOD alone and supreme.</p>
          <p>The frequency with which God is called or described as "the
          Father," is also in this connection to be borne in mind. In the
          New Testament He is called simply "the Father" in no less
          than one hundred and twenty-two passages; in nineteen, "God the
          Father"; in various places, "God our Father," "Our
          Father," "God, even our Father," "God, even the
          Father," "Father of Mercies," or merciful Father,
          "Father of Glory," or glorious Father. He is declared in
          express terms to be "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
          Christ"; while our Lord himself described Him as "your
          Father which is in heaven," "thy Father," "your
          Heavenly Father," "your Father"; and after his
          Resurrection, directed Mary to say to his disciples: "I ascend
          unto my Father and your Father, to my God and your God." Never in
          Scripture, not in one solitary instance, is there the phrase God the
          Son which is so familiar to our ears that its profanity passes
          unnoticed.</p>
          <p>Then the Father is the only object of supreme religious worship.
          Christ worshipped and prayed to the Father; and when asked by his
          disciples to teach them to pray, begins the form which he gave them
          with the invocation- "Our Father who art in Heaven." To the
          woman of Samaria he declared-mark the words "The hour cometh and
          now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father." His
          precepts and his example were uniform and harmonious on this point. He
          always directed his followers to "pray to the Father," as he
          always himself prayed. Alluding to the time when he should be taken
          from them and go to the Father, he expressly forbids them from praying
          to himself, and points them to the Father. " In that day ye shall
          ask me nothing: verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall
          ask of the Father in my name, He will give it you." One might
          almost suppose the Saviour had in view that gross corruption of
          Christian worship, in which he, and not the Father -- his Father is
          the Deity adored. Hence the constant practice of the Apostles, as may
          be seen throughout the Book of Acts and the Epistles. Nowhere do they
          pray, or teach to pray, to Christ.</p>
          <p>Now, in direct opposition to this great, fundamental doctrine of
          the simple Unity of God, the vast majority of the Christian Church
          accepts, and for long centuries has accepted, the mysterious,
          irrational, unscriptural dogma of a Trinity of Persons in the Godhead.
          But not only is the dogma unscriptural, which is our cardinal
          objection to it, the very term "Trinity" is not of
          Scriptural derivation; and, as all who are familiar with the
          Scriptures know, is not to be found there, nor any word or term
          corresponding to it. The word first occurs in its Greek form in the
          writings of Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, near the close of the
          second century; but even there it is not in the ecclesiastical sense
          in which the word was afterwards and is now used. In its Latin form, (Trinitas)
          with a more comprehensive doctrinal import, it is first found in
          Tertullian, a Presbyter of Carthage in Africa, who flourished about
          the same time; and from whom it seems to have been at once adopted by
          his pupil Cyprian and by Novatian.</p>
          <p>To justify the epithets which I have applied to the doctrine, let
          us look at some of the popular statements and expositions of it. I beg
          especial attention to the fact, not simply how various and often
          astounding in themselves are these statements and expositions, but how
          dissimilar to the language of Scripture -- that Scripture which those
          churches and divines who make them, hold to be plenarily inspired;
          and, so far as they are Protestants, to be the sufficient rule of
          faith as well as practice. One would think that a scriptural doctrine
          or truth could be expressed in the language of Scripture; a Christian
          doctrine or truth, in the language of the Christian Scripture,
          "the New Testament of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." To
          do this with the Trinity, is simply impossible, and therefore never
          attempted. Recourse must of necessity be had, not to "words which
          the Holy Ghost but which man's wisdom teacheth." Turn then to the
          Liturgy of the Episcopal Church. In its First "Article of
          Religion" it declares: "In unity of the Godhead there be
          three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity, the Father, the
          Son, and the Holy Ghost." The Episcopal Church in this country,
          did not attain uniformity of worship, till seven years after the war
          of the Revolution. Just two years after the Treaty of Paris, by which
          our national Independence was secured, the first Convention of that
          Church was held in Philadelphia, in September, 1785. Besides other
          omissions and alterations from the Liturgy of the English Established
          Church, to which the churches represented in this Convention had of
          course belonged, it reduced the number of the "Articles of
          Religion" from thirty-nine to twenty; struck out entire the
          Nicene and the Athanasian, and the clause, "He descended into
          Hell," from the Apostles' Creed; and, by a Special Committee,
          published the Prayer-Book in this form.</p>
          <p>This was a remarkable testimony to the then state of feeling and
          opinion in that Church, honestly and openly given. For although no
          essential difference may be detected as to points of faith between the
          twenty and the thirty-nine articles, there must have been some good
          reason for such a marked departure from the Liturgy of the Church of
          England as the rejection of two of its three Creeds; retaining the one
          which has so very little in it to be objected to-except its name, and
          that is not in it but of it, giving the false impression that it is
          the work of the Apostles, which notoriously it is not. That it was the
          Apostles', was never claimed by And then the Presbyterian Church. In
          the Third Article of the Second Chapter of its Confession, it says:
          "In unity of the Godhead, there be three persons, of one
          substance, power, and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God
          the Holy Ghost." In its "Larger Catechism" it says more
          fully: "There be three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the
          Son, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one true, eternal God,
          the same in substance, equal in power and glory, although
          distinguished by their personal properties." But aside of these
          statements of the doctrine by leading Protestant churches amongst us,
          and which are any till the time of Ambrose of Milan, in the fourth
          century; although substantially but in various forms, all admit its
          very high antiquity.</p>
          <p>That the Episcopal Church then in its first attempt at independent
          organization, should have retained only this Creed which, as regards
          the Godhead, is plainly and purely Unitarian, and not Trinitarian, is
          remarkable; and that in one year afterwards it should have unanimously
          admitted the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, though by a majority it
          still persisted in keeping out the Athanasian, is only to be accounted
          for by the in terrorem letter of the Archbishop of Canterbury, in
          which he said: "Whether we can consecrate any (Bishop) or not,
          must yet depend on the answers we may receive to what we have
          written." The last Convention had repeated their request to the
          English hierarchy "to confer the Episcopal character on such
          persons as shall be chosen and recommended to them for that purpose,
          from the Conventions of their Church in their several States;"
          and for this immense boon, and to satisfy that hierarchy, through
          which the Apostolic succession must be had unbroken, (Heaven save the
          mark!) no appeal to the Gospel record, no stand on impregnable
          Scripture and right reason was taken; but so far, at least, submission
          was made before the implied if not express threat of an English
          Archbishop. In the same way it happened, that the obnoxious clause in
          the Apostles' Creed -- "He descended into hell" - which on
          the best of grounds had been struck from the Creed by the first
          Convention, was restored. But how restored? How is the doctrine stated
          or expounded by eminent orthodox writers? Richard Baxter, the eminent
          English non-conformist, says: "The Three Persons, are God
          understanding Himself, God understood by Himself, and God loving
          Himself."</p>
          <p>Doolittle, commenting on the Assembly's Catechism, says: "My
          admiring thoughts of God are of one single essence, yet Three in
          subsistence; of Three, that One cannot be the others, yet all Three
          are One; that are really distinct, yet really are the same." But
          the famous Robert South says: "There It appears, indeed, in the
          body of the Creed; but a rubric is prefixed to the Creed, in which we
          read: "Any churches may omit the words, 'He descended into hell;'
          or may, instead of them, use the words, He went into the place of
          departed spirits,' which are considered as words of the same meaning
          in the Creed." This seems a good deal like child's play. The
          English Archbishops and Bishops in their letter, had informed their
          American brethren, that the article "was thought necessary to be
          inserted, with a view to a particular heresy, in the very early age of
          the Church." But even if so, the article is not found in the
          primitive or earliest forms of the Creed, which doubtless best
          expressed the faith of the earliest age, that nearest the Apostolic
          age of the Church; and the very permission to omit the article,
          concedes its unimportance, let it mean what it may. No unimportant
          article of faith should have place in any Creed, especially one to be
          constantly recited in public worship "by the Minister and the
          People." And a Creed which is professed either as Apostolic
          should at least have the merit of being an exact transcript of its
          expression in the highest Christian antiquity where it is found.</p>
          <p>I have given this matter the more space, because I take "the
          Apostles' Creed" so called, in its oldest form extant, to be the
          most Christian Creed extant; and what is even more important in this
          connection, utterly and emphatically anti-Trinitarian, and so far
          entirely unobjectionable is One, infinite, eternal Mind, and three
          somethings that are not distinct minds." While Bishop Sherlock
          says: "The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are as really distinct
          persons as Peter, James, and John-each of which is God. We must allow
          each person to be a God. These three infinite minds are distinguished
          just as three created minds are by self-consciousness. And by mutual
          consciousness, each person of these has the whole wisdom, power, and
          goodness of the other two." Dr. Wallis, of the English Church,
          holds, that "The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are no more three
          distinct intelligent persons than the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
          Jacob, is three Gods; the three Persons are only three external
          relations of God to his creatures, as Creator, Redeemer, and
          Sanctifier." But Dr. South says: "The three Persons are
          internal relations of the Deity to itself." Dr. Hopkins warns us
          that "It must be carefully observed, that when the word Person is
          applied to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as three distinct persons,
          it does not import the same distinction as when applied to men."
          While on the other hand, Bishop Waterland calls them "proper,
          distinct persons, entirely equal to, and independent of, each other;
          yet making up one and the same being." Archbishop Seeker says:
          "Since there is not a plurality of Gods, and yet the Son and
          Spirit are each of them God no less than the Father, it plainly
          follows, that they are in a manner, by us inconceivable, so united to
          Him, that these Three are One; but still in a manner equally
          inconceivable, so distinguished from Him, that no only of them is the
          other."</p>
          <p>Bishop Burnet's statement is this: "If I say the Father, Son,
          and Holy Spirit be three, and every one distinctly God, it is true;
          but if I say, they be three, and every one a distinct God, it is
          false. I may say, the divine persons are distinct in the divine
          nature; but I cannot say, the divine nature is divided into the divine
          persons. I may say, God the Father is one God-and the Son is God-and
          the Holy Ghost is God; but I cannot say, the Father is one God -- the
          Son another God --- and the Holy Ghost a third God. I may say, the
          Father begat another, who is God; yet I cannot say, he begat another
          God. And from the Father and the Son proceedeth another, who is God;
          yet I cannot say, from the Father and the Son proceedeth another
          God." Bishop Gastrell takes the ground that "The three names
          of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, must denote a threefold
          difference or distinction belonging to God, but such as is consistent
          with the unity and simplicity of the divine nature: for each of these
          includes the whole idea of God, and something more." Upon which
          it has been well remarked that, according to this view, "The
          Father includes the whole idea of God, and something more -- the Son
          includes the whole idea of God, and something more -- the Holy Ghost
          includes the whole idea of God, and something more; while altogether,
          the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, make one entire God, and no
          more!"</p>
          <p>Bishop Burgess insists, that "The Father is a Person, but not
          a Being; the Son, a Person, but not a Being.; the Holy Ghost, a
          Person, but not a Being. And these three non-entities (!) make one
          perfect Being." The celebrated Bishop Heber, one of the most
          brilliant members of the English hierarchy, discovered, that "The
          Father is the First Person in the Trinity; the Archangel Michael, the
          Second; and the Angel Gabriel, the Third." The learned Barrow
          goes a trifle more into details, and says: "There is one divine
          nature or essence common to the Three Persons, incomprehensibly united
          and ineffably distinguished; united in essential
          attributes-distinguished by peculiar relations; all equally infinite
          in every divine perfection; each different from the others in order
          and manner of subsistence. There is a mutual existence of one in all,
          and all in one; a communication, without any deprivation or domination
          in the communicant; an eternal generation and an eternal procession,
          without proper causality or dependence; a Father imparting his own --
          the Son receiving the Father's life and a Spirit issuing from both,
          without any division or multiplication of essence. These are notions
          which may well puzzle our reason, in conceiving how they agree; but
          should not stagger our faith in asserting that they are true."</p>
          <p>And, to close my citations of statements and expositions by eminent
          men of this great dogma, let me place on record in these pages the
          words of Henry Ward Beecher: "My God? Christ Jesus is his name.
          All that there is of God to me is bound up in that name. A dim and
          shadowy effluence rises from Christ, and that I am taught to call the
          Father. A yet more tenuous and invisible film of thought arises, and
          that is the Holy Spirit. But neither are to me aught tangible,
          restful, accessible." While Dr. Nehemiah Adams, of Boston, says:
          "'Do you worship three?' is often asked. Surely we do, nor do we
          strive to make them appear like one. They have specific offices; we
          have specific wants, which lead us appropriately to worship, now one,
          now an. other, now the third."</p>
          <p>I stop not to analyse any of these various and utterly
          contradictory opinions. But I ask whether the various and
          contradictory ways in which the doctrine is stated and expounded do
          not raise a strong presumption at the outset against the doctrine
          itself? One thing must be granted -- all of them cannot be true, for
          they make essentially different and inconsistent doctrines. And if so,
          surely it is possible that even admitting the Trinity to be a
          Scriptural doctrine, the true, the only true, the absolutely orthodox
          mode of receiving and holding the doctrine, remains to this hour
          unknown, since every one of all that has been ventured may be false.
          Is it, then, to be believed that such a doctrine, known in reality
          only by its name, can be an essential, fundamental doctrine of
          Revelation?</p>
          <p>Would God, such a God as "the Father of our Lord Jesus
          Christ" is represented to be in the gospel, have left a doctrine
          of that character -- on the belief of which it used to be said, and is
          even now said in some quarters, that the salvation of the soul depends
          -- so obscurely set forth in His revealed word? Forty particulars have
          been noted by one writer, in which learned Trinitarians differ among
          themselves on this subject. I do not wonder that a mind so thoughtful,
          active, and free as Mr. Beecher's, should have been driven from its
          moorings on any of the accepted expositions of the Trinity; even
          though it brought up on one which, while to all intents and purposes
          nullifying the doctrine itself, fixes him in a form of Unitarianism of
          his own devising, but leaves him at direct war with the plain
          teachings of our Lord: or that in the distraction of thought which
          Trinitarian worship must, in such a mind, engender, he should prefer
          to worship ONE GOD, whose distinctive "name is Christ
          Jesus." Especially, too, if " all that there is of God to
          him" is really "bound up in that name"; if the
          tremendous alternative in his mind was-no God, except Christ be He I
          But I do exceedingly wonder that to one who has so diligently studied
          the full and blessed words of our Lord, the all endeared,
          all-glorious, all-attractive Revelation of the FATHER which they
          declare, so rich in comfort, so inspiring by the light it throws on
          the Divine Purposes and Government, should seem to send up but "a
          dim and shadowy effluence"'! Rob me of any thing but this great,
          most precious faith in an ever-present, all gracious, personal Father
          in heaven I can better afford to part with any other article of my
          religious belief than this of the Divine Paternity, the All-Perfect
          FATHERHOOD of GOD. Without it I am orphaned indeed. Providence seems
          an inexplicable enigma.</p>
          <p>Life a dark and stern problem. Human suffering and death stand in
          man's path to torture or to mock him. It is of no consequence to tell
          me that Mr. Beecher's Christ comprises all to him which the Father
          does to me. For if so, it is by exalting Christ into a place to which
          his fidelity and his humility alike forbade him to aspire; the place
          of that Being whom, in the first of these texts here, let them
          remember the comment of Ambrose - "He did not assert, or arrogate
          to himself, equality with God; so that he might show us an example of
          humility; but subjected himself, that he might be exalted by the
          Father." The late Professor Stuart, in his very and most solemn
          act of prayer, he not only addressed as "Holy Father," but
          testified to be "the ONLY TRUE GOD"! But it is "a
          Mystery," this great doctrine of the Trinity! This is the easy
          and constant resort of its advocates. From the days of Tertullian, who
          exclaimed, "Credo quia impossibile est" -- I believe because
          it is impossible-to our own, it has been their refuge, nay, even their
          ground of glorifying. "I ever did, and ever shall," says
          Bishop Beveridge, "look upon those apprehensions of God to be the
          truest, whereby we apprehend Him to be the most incomprehensible; and
          that to be the most true of God, which seems most impossible unto
          us."</p>
          <p>Bishop Hurd admits that "Reason stands aghast, and Faith
          herself is half confounded" at the manner in which, on the
          Trinitarian scheme, "the grace of God was at length
          manifested." South says of the Trinity in its logical results:
          "Were it not to be adored as a mystery, it would be exploded as a
          contradiction." If we are provoked to a smile at such
          extravagance in Protestants, who thus put themselves at the mercy of
          Romish critics without the slightest means of defence, we admire the
          bold and consistent stand which has always been taken by Romanists on
          church authority. It well becomes them to say, nay, to argue, and
          however unnecessary labor that may seem to us, set themselves to
          prove, as they have done, that, in the words of one of them, "the
          Trinity is opposed to human reason." He says expressly, "My
          belief in the Trinity is based on the authority of the Church; no
          other authority is sufficient;" and then proceeds to show that
          "the Athanasian Creed" -- as, doubtless, the best statement
          of the Trinity -- "and Scripture, are opposed to one
          another."' All this is well enough -- what we might expect -in a
          man or a church, making from the start an utter surrender of Reason
          before the authority of ecclesiastical tradition. Not so in a
          Protestant; for only by the exercise of his Reason has he become a
          Protestant, or can he as a Protestant maintain his position. To us a
          doctrine might be mysterious, and yet be entirely reasonable, and
          harmonize with itself. We are surrounded by, we live amidst, we
          constantly act upon, things mysterious. What more mysterious than God!
          But who of us doubts His Being and great attributes? Who does not
          feel, mysterious though He be, infinitely removed from our
          comprehension, that it is far more reasonable to "believe that He
          is," than to deny it: nay, that to deny it, in the midst of all
          this design and contrivance, this wondrous order, variety, and beauty,
          this fitness of means to ends, these intuitions and aspirations of the
          soul, would be the height of folly or stupidity?</p>
          <p>We may, we do, we often must, believe what we cannot comprehend;
          but never a contradiction or an absurdity. But whence came this
          doctrine of the Trinity, or, in other words, what was its origin? Its
          origin was clearly Platonic. It was brought into the Christian Church
          by those of the early Fathers who admired and had adopted the
          philosophic views of the later Platonists. I say advisedly, the later
          Platonists; because, in the words of Prof. Norton: "Nothing
          resembling the doctrine of the Trinity is to be found in the writings
          of Plato himself. But there is no question that, in different forms,
          it was a favorite doctrine of the later Platonists, equally of those
          who were not Christians as of those who were." There is an
          obvious distinction to be borne in mind between what is positively
          taught by the Athenian Philosopher, and what belongs to the Platonic
          philosophy as held and expounded by Philo Judseus, a contemporary of
          our Lord, who has been styled the Jewish Plato, and by the Fathers, or
          Christian writers of the first four centuries.</p>
          <p>The most eminent of these men, especially those of Alexandria, the
          birthplace of Philo, and the scene of his labors, had in general
          embraced this philosophy to a greater or less extent; and they carried
          its modes of conception and reasoning into the faith to which they
          were converted. It was, as Mosheim admits, "the impure source of
          a great number of errors, and most preposterous opinions;" but of
          them all, none is more marked than this very doctrine of the Trinity,
          which Mosheim himself accepted. Basnage, in his History of the Jews,
          remarks, that these Fathers almost made Plato to have been a Christian
          before Christianity was introduced; in allusion to some of their
          efforts to show that Plato himself taught the doctrine. Cudworth, who
          in his "Intellectual System," has exhausted the ancient
          learning on this subject, says that "the generality of the
          Christian Fathers, before and after the Nicene Council, represent the
          genuine Platonic Trinity as really the same thing with the Christian,
          or as approaching so near it, that they differed chiefly in
          circumstances, or the manner of expression;" and declares that,
          "therefore does Athanasius send the Arians to school to the
          Platonists." Bishop Horsley, too, in his thirteenth Letter to Dr.
          Priestley, says: "The advocates of the Catholic faith in modern
          times, have been too apt to take alarm at the charge of Platonism. I
          rejoice and glory in the opprobrium; I not only confess, but I
          maintain, not a perfect agreement, but such a similitude as speaks a
          common origin, and affords an argument in confirmation of the Catholic
          doctrine (of the Trinity), from its conformity to the most ancient and
          universal traditions."</p>
          <p>In one of his charges to his clergy, he says: "It must be
          acknowledged, that the first converts from the Platonic school took
          advantage of the resemblance between the Evangelic and Platonic
          doctrine on the subject of the Godhead, to apply the principles of
          their old philosophy to the explication and confirmation of the
          articles of their faith. They defended it by arguments drawn from
          Platonic principles; they even propounded it in Platonic
          language." It were easy to multiply, from Trinitarian
          authorities, proofs which must strike every thoughtful and candid
          inquirer, of the Platonic origin of the doctrine under consideration.
          Milman, writing of "The Trinitarian controversy" at the
          beginning of the fourth century, has significant words, with. which I
          close my remarks on this point. Having said, "This Platonism if
          it may be so called, was universal " -- and to a degree
          confirmatory of the words before quoted from Prof Norton -- that
          "It differed, indeed, widely in most systems from the original
          philosophy of the Athenian sage; it had acquired a more oriental and
          imaginative cast;" he adds: "This Platonism had gradually
          absorbed all the more intellectual class; it hovered over, as it were,
          and gathered under its wings all the religions of the world.
          Alexandria"' --- it will be remembered that this was the
          birth-place of the distinguished Jewish Platonist, Philo, the
          influence of whose writings is, as I have already hinted, so obvious
          on the early Fathers -- "Alexandria, the fatal and prolific soil
          of speculative controversy, where speculative controversy was most
          likely to madden into furious and lasting hostility, gave birth to
          this new element of disunion in the Christian world."</p>
          <p>He alludes to the great Arian Controversy, which had its germ in
          the anathema and expulsion from Alexandria of Arius, one of its
          presbyters, by Alexander, the Patriarch of that metropolitan see, for
          what he was pleased to style, "blasphemies against the divine
          Redeemer." Arius held the Father to be alone the self-existent,
          unoriginated God, and the Son to be "the Only-begotten, the image
          of the Father, the Vicegerent of the Divine Power, the intermediate
          Agent in all the long subsequent work of Creation." This
          controversy, in the judgment of the Trinitarian Milman, turned upon a
          "question which led to all the evils of human strife, hatred,
          persecution, bloodshed." "From this period we may
          date," he says, "the introduction of rigorous articles of
          belief, which required the submissive assent of the mind to every word
          and letter of an established creed, and which raised the slightest
          heresy of opinion into a more fatal offence against God, and a more
          odious crime in the estimation of man, than the worst moral
          delinquency, or the most flagrant deviation from the spirit of
          Christianity."</p>
          <p>But although the doctrine of the Trinity had a Platonic origin, it
          is not to be understood that it assumed at once its modern form. It
          advanced towards that by measured steps. Previous to the Council of
          Nice, A.D. 325, the nearest approach to the modern doctrine of the
          Trinity was, that the Father alone was Supreme God, and the Son and
          Holy Ghost beings created by and subordinate to Him, each called God,
          but in a lower sense. In the Nicene Creed, so called because voted in
          by the Council above referred to -- a mode of rather doubtful
          propriety for establishing what is Revealed Truth - "the
          Father" is alone described as "Almighty," and alone in
          the absolute sense called " One God." But "Jesus Christ
          "is described as "One Lord," "the only-begotten
          Son of God, Begotten of his Father before all worlds." Could any
          language more plainly mark derivation? and if in such a case
          derivation were rightly predicable, it of necessity made the derived
          being, "the Son," inferior and subordinate to the Being from
          whom he was derived -- "the Father Almighty." The Holy Ghost
          is not even called " God" in any sense. Beyond this the
          church had not yet gone. The Council of Nice "established as the
          inviolable doctrine of the Catholic Church, that the Son is of the
          same essence with the Father; but sustains to Him the relation in
          which that which is begotten stands to that which begets." It
          decided nothing as respects the nature of the Holy Spirit. It
          contented itself with simply saying, "and in One Holy
          Ghost." In this unsettled state the doctrine remained for more
          than fifty years, as we shall by and by see, before another step
          towards modern Trinitarianism was taken.</p>
          <p>Before closing this Lecture, I may remark, that the word
          "Persons" applied to the "Sacred Three," is not in
          general admitted by Trinitarians to be used in its strictly
          etymological, just, or accustomed sense. Some, indeed, so use and
          understand it, and accept all the legitimate consequences; and so long
          as the word is used at all in connection with this subject, we have a
          right to hold all the advocates of the doctrine there. They are not to
          take shelter under any plea of mystery, where the mystery is of their
          own making. No word in our language has a more obvious and simple
          significance. The late Prof. Stuart of Andover, lamented that it
          should have ever crept into the symbols of the churches, and preferred
          "distinctions," much as Dr. South did "somethings;"
          while the late Pres. Dwight of Yale College, says he does not know
          what the word means, but yet thinks it "a convenient term."
          Convenient! for what? when confessedly it is, in the connection used,
          so ambiguous as to be utterly unintelligible.</p>
          <p>I Now come to consider the claims of the Trinity, or the grounds on
          which it is held as a doctrine of Revealed Religion, and especially of
          the Gospel. How often and how confidently has it been called
          preeminently the doctrine of the Bible-alleged to be written out, nay,
          standing out on its pages from Genesis to Revelation in such bold
          relief, that "he who runs may read" And yet nothing is
          farther from the truth. Beginning with the Hebrew race, in all their
          generations, and for whose special instruction the Old Testament was
          compiled, they are a standing testimony that it teaches no such
          doctrine. With a firmness and clearness of statement which admit of
          neither tampering nor evasion, they hold, and always held, that their
          Sacred Books declare most emphatically the doctrine of the strict,
          simple Unity of God. Christian Trinitarian expositors, Catholic and
          Protestant, affirm the same; and confess, with Bishop Burnet,
          "that it would not be easy to prove the Trinity from the Old
          Testament." Finally, the Christian Fathers did not so much as
          pretend that the doctrine was plainly taught in the New Testament, or
          by Christ and his Apostles. On the contrary, they often use the utmost
          ingenuity to account for the' obscurity in which it was kept by them,
          as well as for the total ignorance concerning it of the favored
          people. What Christ and his Apostles did not plainly teach, would not
          be likely to appear in what the latter wrote. Some of the Fathers, as
          Athanasius, assigned as a reason why Christ did not declare his Deity
          to the Jews, that the world could not yet bear the doctrine; and he
          affirmed that the disciples had no knowledge of it before Pentecost.</p>
          <p>Theodoret declares, that before his death, Jesus did not appear as
          God either to the Jews or the Apostles. And Chrysostom not only says,
          that Christ did not immediately reveal his Deity, but that Mary did
          not herself know the secret that he was God Supreme. All through the
          writings of these men, so far as they are preserved to us, we have
          their acknowledgments that even after the death of Christ his Apostles
          did not openly teach the doctrine; alleging the fact as a proof of
          their prudence and wisdom-on the one hand as regarded the Jews, who
          held so tenaciously the Unity of Jehovah, and whose prejudices would
          be shocked; on the other, the Gentiles, who might thereby be confirmed
          in their polytheism. Chrysostom would have us believe that the Apostle
          begins his Epistle to the Hebrews by declaring that "it was God
          who spake by the prophets, and not that Christ himself had spoken by
          them, because their minds were weak, and they were not able to bear
          the doctrine concerning Christ. (Ecumenius, on the text in Paul's
          first Epistle to the Corinthians, eighth chapter and sixth verse -
          "There is one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ" --
          says: "The Apostle speaks cautiously of the Father and the Son,
          calling the Father One God, lest they should think there were two
          Gods; and the Son One Lord, lest they should think there were two
          Lords." And Theophylact, on 1 Tim. 2: 5 -- " For there is
          One God, and One Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
          Jesus" -- says: "Because polytheism then prevailed, the
          Apostle did not speak plainly of the Deity of Christ, lest he should
          be thought to introduce many Gods.")</p>
          <p>None of these writers are later than A.D. 320. Of course, if Christ
          be not plainly taught by the Apostles to be God, no such Trinity as is
          alleged can have been. It were here pertinent to ask, what authority
          had these men-for whom no special illumination, not to say
          inspiration, can with any show of plausibility be pretended, nay,
          which is never assumed for them-to foist upon the Church this great
          "mystery," to charge upon the sacred writers this strange
          concealment? Every man of common-sense will answer, none whatever. The
          claim of such authority is preposterous, and not for a moment to be
          regarded. So far, however, as their admissions go to the point, that
          Holy Scripture, on its face and in plain language, does not teach the
          doctrine, the same have been made in every age since down to our
          own-alike by Romanist and Protestant. Learned men of the Romish
          Communion, though firmly holding to their Trinitarianism, make the
          same admissions. Sacroboscus, in his "Defence of the Council of
          Trent," declares that "the Arians appealed to the Scriptures
          in support of their opinions; and that they were not condemned by the
          Scriptures, but by Tradition." Alphonso Salmeron says:
          "Christ did not receive testimony from the Evangelists that he
          was God."</p>
          <p>Cardinal Ihosius says: "We believe the doctrine of a Triune
          God, because we have received it by tradition, though not mentioned at
          all in Scripture." And, most distinctly and boldly, Remundus,
          addressing the Lutherans and Calvinists, warns them in these words:
          "You will be obliged to confess, however unwillingly, that if you
          rely on the Scriptures you will be compelled to yield to the modern
          Arians, no less than the Fathers were to those of ancient times;
          unless, like them, you appeal to Tradition, and the unanimous consent
          of the Church. They were taught by Tradition that there are Three
          Consubstantial Persons of the same nature and essence which we worship
          as One God in the fulness of the Trinity; and also, that in Jesus
          Christ there are Two perfect substances, but only One Person. Tell me,
          if you listen to the Scriptures, and the express word of God alone,
          with what arms can you expect to engage with these men? In what way
          can you extricate yourselves from the innumerable arguments which they
          advance, unless you cling to Tradition, and the consent of the Church,
          as the only anchor of safety?"</p>
          <p>In our own day, Mr. Newman, a convert to Rome from the Church of
          England, in his "Arians of the Fourth Century," says:
          "It may startle those who are but little acquainted with the
          popular writings of this day, (fourth century,) yet I believe the most
          accurate consideratiol of the subject will lead us to acquiesce in the
          statement as a general truth, that the doctrines in question (the
          Trinity, Atonement, etc.) have never been learned merely from
          Scripture. Surely the Sacred volume was never intended, and was not
          adapted, to teach our creed. From the first, it has been the error of
          heretics to neglect the information provided for them, and to attempt
          for themselves a work for which they are unable -the eliciting of
          systematic doctrine from the scattered notices of the truth which
          Scripture contains." But Trinitarians of the Protestant Faith
          have confessed the obscurity of the Sacred Text upon this subject. The
          zealous French Reformer, Jurieu, though holding that, to deny the
          Trinity, was to be guilty of one of the deadliest heresies, allows, in
          his Pastoral Letters, that it was not known in its proper shape till
          the early part of the fourth century, at the Council of Nice -- nay,
          till the Council of Constantinople - and even proves, from the
          Fathers, that during the three first centuries it was the universal
          opinion, that the Son was not equal to the Father, nor his existence
          of the same duration.</p>
          <p>Bishop Smallridge, of the English Church, has this language:
          "It must be owned that the doctrine of the Trinity, as it is
          proposed in our Articles, our Liturgy, our Creeds, is not in so many
          words taught us in the Holy Scriptures. What we profess in our prayers
          we nowhere read in Scripture, that the One God, the One Lord, is not
          one only Person, but Three Persons in one substance. There is no such
          text in Scripture as this, that 'the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity
          in Unity, is to be worshipped.' No one of the inspired writers hath
          expressly affirmed that in the Trinity none is afore or after other,
          none is greater or less than another, but the whole three persons are
          coeternal together and co-equal." But the most striking
          acknowledgment upon this point from a learned Protestant, was made in
          a speech delivered to the Irish House of Lords by Dr. Clayton, Bishop
          of Clogher, on the second of February, 1756. He said: "The
          strongest abettors of the Nicene Creed do not so much as pretend that
          the doctrine of the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son is to
          be found in the Scriptures, but only in the writings of some of the
          primitive Fathers. And I beseech your Lordships to consider whether it
          is not absolutely contradictory to the fundamental principles on which
          the Reformation of the religion from Popery is built, to have any
          doctrine established as a rule of faith which is founded barely on
          Tradition, and is not plainly and clearly revealed in the
          Scriptures?"</p>
          <p>I cannot refrain from adding what has a strong bearing on this
          entire discussion, that he said: "As to the ecclesiastical
          history of this and the following century, (the third and fourth,) I
          must inform your Lordships that all those books which were published
          in opposition to the decrees of the Council of Nice have been
          destroyed -- so that all our information comes from the other side.
          And of all those histories suffered to come down to our hands, I do
          not know of one, except Eusebius of Cesarea, (who says little on the
          subject,) but what is so filled with falsehood, vagaries or
          contradictions, that their veracity is not to be depended on."
          If, then, the Trinity be not a doctrine expressly taught in Scripture,
          it can be at the best but a matter of inference. And so accordingly it
          is often declared to be by Trinitarian Protestants. The Romanist takes
          it on tradition, but they on inference. Mr. Carlile, in his
          "Jesus Christ the Great God our Saviour," admits that:
          "The doctrine of the Trinity is rather a doctrine of inference
          and of indirect intimation, than a doctrine directly and explicitly
          declared." And still further: "That a doctrine of inference
          ought never to be placed on a footing of equality with a doctrine of
          direct and explicit revelation." The celebrated Oxford Tracts
          ask: "Where is this solemn and comfortable mystery (of the
          Trinity) formally stated in Scripture as we find it in the
          Creeds?" and proceed to declare it a thing of inference. The same
          Bishop Smallridge, from whom I just now quoted, goes on, in close
          connection, to say: "But although these truths are not read in
          Scripture, yet they may easily, regularly, and undeniably be inferred
          from Scripture." And well does he add: "If, indeed, it can
          be shown that these inferences are wrong, they may safely be
          rejected." Beyond all question they may; and this is the very
          thing I am trying to show, and hope to make plain.</p>
          <p>The case stands simply thus: There is not a shadow of pretence for
          calling it a plainly-revealed doctrine of Scripture. It is, as
          evidently, a doctrine of inference, and inference merely. Christ is
          never in Scripture styled God, identically, or, if you prefer,
          equally, the same being as the Father, the Infinite, the Supreme,
          "the Only True God." But, things are said of him, or by him,
          which it is supposed could have been spoken only of or by Jehovah,
          from which it is inferred that Christ is God. Many things are ascribed
          to the Holy Spirit which are supposed peculiar to Jehovah; therefore
          it is inferred that the Holy Spirit is God. Again: since this would
          look like having Three Gods, and yet God being undeniably and over and
          over again declared to be but ONE, it is further inferred that the
          Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, must all be that One God. And
          so, by heaping inference on inference, comes this Trinity in Unity.
          How unreasonable to call such a doctrine an essential, fundamental
          article of Christian Faith! The moment it is permitted to establish
          and require assent to one article on such grounds, where are we to
          stop? What might not be established in this way? By a little
          ingenuity, and false interpretation of Scripture language, we might
          infer the most absurd notions, and open a floodgate of scandal and
          reproach on the Truth. No; the very term inferred, negatives any
          allegation that the doctrine inferred is one revealed or declared to
          be true, and all claim to its being essential to be believed.</p>
          <p>Holy Scripture, then, being our witness -- and our appeal lies
          there -- Holy Scripture nowhere affirms the doctrine. I say this
          deliberately. The direct, positive, literal, express declarations of
          Scripture affirm the opposite. "There is One God; and there is
          none other but He." No creed in Christendom expresses the
          doctrine in Scripture language, for the simple reason that it is
          impossible. Its stoutest advocates, who most insist on calling it a
          plain doctrine of the Bible, who are most ready to demand faith in it
          as a Fundamental, have never defined, because they cannot define it,
          in the words of Scripture. In saying this, it is with full knowledge
          that our Trinitarian brethren profess to hold, nevertheless, the
          doctrine of the Divine Unity; nor would I cast the least doubt or
          imputation on their sincerity in that profession. But they hold it in
          such a way as seems to me virtually to deny, and practically do it
          away, by merging it in this great "mystery." I repeat that I
          do not object to the Trinity for its mere mysteriousness. As I have
          already said, I find mystery every where. But I do object to its
          unscripturalness, self-contradictoriness, absurdity, polytheistic
          aspect. I can see it in no other light. I can think of nothing more
          absurd-nothing which savors more of polytheism. That many Trinitarians
          conscientiously and honestly, as well as devoutly, adore the Trinity
          as a Divine mystery, I gladly admit; but they make or find a mystery
          where I do not and cannot. In me, therefore, it would be plain
          polytheism to worship the Three Persons each as God; and all who do so
          worship, are solemnly bound to set to it by their allegiance to the
          Truth -- "the Truth as it is in Jesus" -- that they have
          express Scripture warrant. Moreover, I say, nay, I insist, and on this
          am ready to join issue, that they have no right in this or in any case
          to set that up as a fundamental article of Faith, to make that a
          condition of holding the Christian name, or of Christian fellowship,
          which is not taught with the utmost directness, explicitness, and
          perspicuity, in the Christian Scriptures. And such is not the Trinity.</p>
          <p>Let us pass now to examine some of the arguments by which it is
          attempted to maintain the doctrine. We are referred to the use of the
          plural pronouns in the Old Testament, where God speaks of Himself, and
          of the plural form of the Hebrew proper names of the Deity. In the
          first case, only three instances occur in the whole of the Old
          Testament. "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
          likeness." "And the Lord said, Go to, let us go down."
          "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
          and who will go for us?" Now it is an obvious answer to any
          argument drawn from such citations, that if these three seem to
          indicate a plurality of persons in the Godhead, the supposition is
          utterly rebutted by the fact, that the singular pronoun is used
          thousands on thousands of times, implying that God is but one Person.
          Besides, it is a common idiom in all languages, and in every age, for
          persons in authority to speak of themselves in the plural; as, for
          example, "We, Victoria, by the Grace of God, Queen," etc.
          Nothing is more common in the Old Testament. In Ezra, Artaxerxes, king
          of Persia, begins his royal reply, "The letter which ye sent unto
          us" - and proceeds, as if to show the idleness of the argument
          under consideration- "hath been plainly read before me."</p>
          <p>That this idiom is only a common one, and by no means indicative of
          any plurality of persons in the being using it, is proved conclusively
          in that the same Lord or Jehovah who in the second of the two passages
          cited from Genesis says, "Let us go down," says in another,
          with a precisely similar purpose, "I will go down." In the
          second case, the plural forms of Hebrew names of God, the simple
          explanation is found in what the best Hebrew Grammars say. Wilson, in
          his, says: "Words that express dominion, dignity, majesty, are
          commonly put in the plural." And Prof. Stuart, in his, l says
          even more distinctly: "For the sake of emphasis, the Hebrews
          commonly employed most of the words which signify Lord, God, etc., in
          the plural form, but with the sense of the singular. This is called
          the pluralis excellentice." Learned Trinitarians, Romanists, as
          Bishop Tostat, Cardinal Cajetan, Bellarmine-Protestant, as Calvin,
          Grotius, South, Campbell, Michaelis, Rosenmiiller, with a host of
          others, among whom are the best critics and lexicographers, alike
          recognize this rule of the Hebrew syntax. Trinitarians being our
          authority, the point is too plain to be longer dwelt upon. Not even a
          plurality of persons in the Godhead, much less any definite plurality
          such as a trinity, can be with any propriety argued from the plural
          form of Hebrew words.</p>
          <p>Turning to the New Testament, the scene at the Baptism of our Lord
          by John is sometimes cited in proof of the Trinity, because the Sacred
          Three were obviously present together and united in one act; the
          Father by the voice from the opened heavens; the Son standing in the
          water; the Holy Spirit in the descending dove. But surely, if any
          three objects could be distinct, different, apart, these were. Besides
          this, there are really but three passages in the New Testament, which
          are cited with any show of reason. The first is the Baptismal Formula
          at the close of Matthew's Gospel. But nothing is there said of the
          oneness in any sense, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; no hint the
          remotest given that they are one. Then as to the preposition rendered
          in, it were better rendered to or into; while the words the name of
          are in the original simply an idiom of the Hebraistic Greek, in which
          the New Testament is written, redundant in the translation and making
          obscure its meaning. "Go ye, therefore," says the Saviour,
          "and make disciples of all nations; baptizing them to or into the
          Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." In other words,
          consecrating them by Baptism to the faith and worship of the Father,
          the Supreme and All-bountiful Source and Giver of good, spiritual and
          temporal; to the open acceptance and service of that Gospel of truth
          and salvation which He has revealed and published by His Son; and to
          the right improvement of those exhaustless and gracious influences by
          which He moves on the soul, and is ever ready to aid, guide, quicken,
          and strengthen in all goodness and duty. The second passage is the
          Benediction with which the Apostle eludes his second epistle to the
          Corinthian church.</p>
          <p>The same remark is true of this as of the previous passage, that
          there is no mention, no hint, of the oneness of the Father, Son, and
          Holy Ghost. It is simply the expression of an affectionate, devout,
          and earnest wish on the part of Paul, that "The Grace of our Lord
          Jesus Christ "- the divine favors, benefits, blessings,
          privileges, conferred on man through Christ and his Gospel --
          "the Love of God" - of that Sovereign and glorious Being,
          that all-gracious Father, who in His own essential and perfect nature
          "is Love" itself -- " and the Communion of the Holy
          Ghost " -- the full participation of those gifts and graces,
          which are the earnest and seal of the Spirit of God shed abroad in the
          hearts of all faithful seekers-might be with all them whom he had
          brought into, the Christian church. Where, in either of these
          passages, is the least trace of this amazing dogma of "Three
          Persons in one God "? But the third passage to which I referred,
          is the famous text of the "Three Heavenly Witnesses." And in
          respect to this I feel bound to say, that did I not know that this
          text had been recently cited in a pulpit of this city, without a hint
          that its integrity had been even disputed, as an unquestioned and
          express scriptural proof of the doctrine under discussion, I should
          feel it labor wholly uncalled-for, and mere waste of time, to
          recapitulate even in the briefest manner, as I now intend, the
          evidence of its utter spuriousness.</p>
          <p>Briefly, then. The verse is not found in any ancient Greek Ms.;
          that is, in any Ms. of an age prior to the sixth century. Bishop Marsh
          calls it "a passage, which no ancient Greek manuscript contains,
          and which no ancient Greek father ever saw." Of one hundred and
          fifty mss. of an alleged age as early as the sixteenth century, which
          are extant, and have been collated, and which contain the First
          Epistle of St. John, only two contain this verse. One of these, known
          as the Codex Ravianus, was considered by Wetstein a gross imposture;
          and Michaelis, who says, "it is the second of the two manuscripts
          which have 1 John 5: 7," and that "it contains one half the
          sum total of the evidence in favor of that passage," also
          pronounces it "' a mere imposture;" and adds: "' Let it
          be considered in future as having no critical existence, and never
          quoted in support of this verse." The other is known as the Codex
          Montfortianus. It comprises the whole New Testament, and is in the
          library of Trinity College, Dublin. It is really the only genuine
          manuscript which contains the verse; but it is of as recent date as
          the close of the fifteenth century.</p>
          <p>Bishop Marsh says that "it made its appearance about the year
          1520; and, that the Ms. had just been written, when it first appeared,
          is highly probable, because it appeared at a critical juncture, and
          its appearance answered a particular purpose." What this
          "particular purpose" was, we shall presently see. Michaelis
          pronounces the manuscript "unimportant -- on account of its
          modern date" and says that "the spurious passage in the
          first epistle of St. John, was admitted into no manuscript before the
          sixteenth century. The very tenacity with which Michaelis held the
          doctrine of the Trinity, made him the more desirous to keep this
          "spurious passage" out of the sacred text.</p>
          <p>Speaking of the "immense weight of evidence against" it,
          this great critic says: "One should suppose that no critic,
          especially if a Protestant, would hesitate a moment to condemn as
          spurious, a passage, which is contained in no ancient Greek
          manuscript, is quoted by no Greek Father, was unknown to the Alogi in
          the second century, is wanting in both Syriac versions, in the Coptic,
          Armenian, Ethiopic, and Sclavonian versions, is contained only in the
          Latin, and is wanting in many manuscripts even of this version, was
          quoted by none of the Latin Fathers of the four first centuries, and
          to some of them, who lived so late as the sixth century, was either
          wholly unknown, or was not received as genuine." The
          "particular purpose" which the "appearance" of the
          Montfortian Mrs. "answered," according to Bishop Marsh, in
          the extract a little above, was this: The celebrated Erasmus published
          his first edition of the New Testament in the original Greek,
          accompanied by his own Latin translation, in the year 1516, and the
          second in 1519. From both he omitted the verse.</p>
          <p>Assailed violently from various quarters, his answer was: "I
          will not undertake to add what is not in the Greek manuscripts before
          me." At last, however, so confident was he of his ground, he
          declared, that if any Greek MS. could be found which contained it, he
          would insert it in his next edition; and shortly after, the Dublin
          Ms., before referred to, the Codex Montfortianus, was produced.
          Suspecting it all the while to be a translation from the Vulgate or
          Latin, as he has left on record, he nevertheless felt compelled by the
          word he had passed; and therefore did insert the verse in his third
          edition, in 1622.</p>
          <p>In that very year Luther published the first edition of his German
          Bible, and omitted it. He evidently, as Michaelis thinks, must have
          deemed the manuscript which compelled Erasmus to insert it, "of
          no authority;" and nothing, either of evidence or of censure,
          could induce him to admit the text into any of the subsequent editions
          which he issued. In the last edition, which was printed while he was
          living, that of 1546, he made this request: "I request my friends
          and my foes, my masters, printers, and readers, to let this New
          Testament continue mine. If they find faults in it, let them make
          another. I know well what I make; I see also well, what others make.
          But this Testament shall remain Luther's German Testament. Nowadays
          there is neither measure nor end of mending and bettering. Let every
          man therefore take heed of false copies, for I know how unfaithfully
          and untruly others have reprinted what I have printed." Yet,
          strange to say, Luther had hardly been thirty years dead, before, with
          "Luther's Translation" on the title-page, the passage was
          foisted into his German text I The verse is not in the old Latin
          Vulgate, or in any Latin version older than the ninth century. It is
          not in the old Syriac version of the third century, or in the
          manuscripts of the Ethiopic, nearly as ancient. It is not in the
          Egyptian Arabic, or indeed in any of the Arabic versions, or in the
          Armenian, all of the fourth century. It is not in the ancient French
          version, more than one thousand years old; or in the Illyrian, used in
          Russia, Muscovy, and by all the Slavonic races. It is rejected by the
          highest critical authorities of modern times, of every shade of
          theological opinion; besides Michaelis, as we have seen, by Wetstein,
          Simon, Griesbach, Le Clerc, Matthaei, Tischendorf, all Trinitarians.</p>
          <p>Bishop Lowth denies the use of his understanding to the man who
          would defend it. Dr. Middleton, Bishop Marsh, Archbishop Newcome, Mr.
          Horne, Prof. Porson, the unrivalled Greek scholar, Dr. Adam Clarke,
          the great Methodist commentator, abandon it. The Eclectic Review says:
          "We are unspeakably ashamed, that any modern divines should have
          contended for retaining a passage so indisputably spurious." The
          London Quarterly, long considered the champion of the English
          Established Church, reviewing Bishop Burgess' vindication of the
          verse, says: "The Bishop, then, on his own avowal, has been able
          to dismiss every doubt respecting the genuineness of a verse which is
          found only in a single Greek manuscript, and that of recent date;
          which is not quoted by a single Greek Father, nor in express terms by
          any Latin Father, before the sixth century; which is wanting in the
          more ancient manuscripts of the Vulgate or Latin; and even in those in
          which it is found, appears in such a variety of shapes as clearly to
          show, that those transcribers, who thought proper to insert the verse,
          had no certain reading before them. We have the most sincere respect
          for the Bishop of St. David's, but we cannot peruse the declaration
          without astonishment."</p>
          <p>The British Critic, the acknowledged organ of the Establishment, re
          viewed, in 1830, the whole controversy, and thus closed:
          "Believing that the verse is unquestionably spurious, and
          consequently that its authenticity cannot be maintained, except by the
          admission of principles which would tend inevitably to destroy our
          confidence in the authenticity of every other passage in the New
          Testament, we have witnessed with uneasiness the attempt of the
          learned Prelate (Bishop Burgess) to establish its claim to an inspired
          origin, and have wondered at the arguments by which he thinks its
          claim is proved." To cite one more name. Dr. Davidson, Professor
          of Theology in the Independent College, near Manchester, England, in
          his Lectures, summing up the evidence on both sides, says: "It is
          almost superfluous to add, that many of the most strenuous defenders
          of the doctrine of the Trinity have maintained the verse to be
          spurious; and that the great body of critics is opposed to its
          authenticity." Our American Prof. Stuart, of Andover, doubts, and
          Prof. S. HI. Turner, of New York, rejects it. All the above are
          Trinitarian authorities; but to any who know their reputation, quite
          as weighty are Unitarians like Newton, Locke, Lardner, Milton,
          Priestley, and our own Norton.</p>
          <p>And yet this merest interpolation, this spurious text, is still
          retained in our Bibles, is read in and preached from the pulpit, by
          men who do or should know its spuriousness, and holds its place in the
          Book of Common Prayer of the English Church and the Episcopal Church
          in these United States; where, in the Epistle for the first Sunday
          after Easter, it is of course read publicly once at least in the year,
          and probably "without note or comment," as part and parcel
          of the "inspired word of God"! But admit for the sake of
          argument, that the verse is the genuine testimony of St. John, the
          Evangelist, the disciple whom Jesus loved. What then? Of what is it
          the proof? Of the doctrine of the Trinity? of the Trinity in Unity,
          and Unity in Trinity? of Three Persons in one God? By no means.
          Nothing of the kind. Mr. Wardlaw says: "It has been allowed by
          Trinitarians of the highest fame not to be so." Calvin says, that
          "the expression, three are one, must signify in agreement, and
          not in essence." Beza interprets it in the same way; and
          Macknight, paraphrasing the verse, says: "These three are one, in
          respect of the unity of their testimony." The very structure and
          syntax of the Greek original, demand this interpretation, and will
          properly bear no other.</p>
          <p>If you will turn to the passage in our received version, you will
          see, I think, as corroborating the results of the best criticism upon
          it, that the spurious words break and mar the sense of the context. No
          reference, no allusion, had been made to "the Father, the Word,
          and the Holy Ghost," by the Apostle; but in the sixth verse he
          had mentioned the "water," the "blood," and
          "the Spirit." Hence very naturally and consecutively he
          proceeds, as the passage should read: " For there are three that
          bear record: the Spirit, and the water, and the Blood; and these three
          agree in one." I return now to my main course of argument; and I
          say, in the first place, that the doctrine of the Trinity, if the
          ultimate appeal lies to the Scriptures-as with all consistent
          Protestant Christians it surely must-is disproved by their general
          tenor and drift. That is uniform to the point of the simple and strict
          Unity of God. Who that is familiar with the Scripture, will deny this?
          But in the next place, the positive, clear, unmistakable declarations
          of Scripture, disprove it.</p>
          <p>What can be more positive, clear, unmistakable in its import, than
          the language of Jehovah by Moses: "Hear, O Israel! the Lord, our
          God, is One Lord! And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all
          thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might."
          This, too, cited and emphasized as it is by our blessed Saviour
          himself, as the first and great commandment. Moreover, note the care
          with which the sacred writers every where distinguish and keep
          distinct the Father from the Son, our God from his Anointed. So
          remarkable is this fact, so strong and emphatic the language in which
          it expresses itself, that one is almost tempted to think they foresaw
          this great corruption of subsequent ages, and would do what they could
          to guard the Church against any confounding of Christ with God. For
          example, St. Paul says: "There is none other GOD but ONE; for
          though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth,
          (as there be gods many, and lords many;) but to us there is but One
          God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and One Lord
          Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him." So again:
          "One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism; ONE GOD and Father of all, who
          is above all, and through all, and in you all"</p>
          <p>In the introductory salutations of the Apostolic Epistles, mark how
          consistent with these statements is the language; holding this view,
          how naturally it expresses itself: "Grace be unto you, and peace,
          from God, our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be God,
          even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and
          the God of all comfort." This is from the second Epistle to the
          Corinthians; but you will find it but an example of the uniform style
          of St. Paul, and with the slightest possible variation of the other
          Apostles. Then further; by admission of distinguished Trinitarian
          scholars and divines, even of Protestant communions, as we have seen,
          the doctrine of the Trinity is not clearly, but at the most obscurely
          taught in the Scriptures; is to be learned by uninitiated readers, not
          from the Scriptures but from the Church. The entire Romish Church
          takes exactly this ground, and in its extreme form; holding that
          though the doctrine be in the Scriptures, the laity cannot find it
          there, since it is in charge of the Church through its traditions, and
          to the Church must they come to learn it. Since my residence in
          Brooklyn, the Rev. Dr. Seabury, of New York, one of the most learned
          ministers of the Episcopal Church, and at that time editing The
          Churchman, declared in its columns, that there were two rules for the
          guidance of Christian believers: the one, the Rule of Faith, which
          regarded all things plainly taught in Scripture, the conduct of life,
          and the duties of man; the other, the Rule of Tradition, which
          regarded things obscurely taught there, for example, the Trinity, etc.
          Again, the various and contradictory forms of stating and expounding
          the doctrine, the different senses in which it is accepted and held,
          raise a violent presumption against the doctrine as belonging to
          Christ's holy gospel; suggest and furnish reasons for the weightiest
          doubts of its truth; and, at the very least, stamp it as unimportant,
          and refute all pretension to its being fundamental and essential. Any
          doctrine essentially belonging to Revealed Religion, would be clearly
          stated in the Records of that Revelation; it would be so clearly
          stated there, that nobody could mistake it; it would be one and
          uniform in all ages of the Church, and every where in Christendom.</p>
          <p>Here remember, that no such words or phrases as the Trinity, the
          Triune God, the God-man, occur in Scripture. They savor certainly far
          more of the subtleties of the schoolmen than of the simplicity of Holy
          writ. But not only are no such words and phrases to be found there,
          where is the known case of any man for the first time taking these
          Scriptures into his hands, whether in the original or in translation,
          in any language, in any land, with no previous knowledge of the
          religion they teach, with no preconceptions of Christian doctrine of
          any kind, and of himself finding there the dogmas which those words
          and phrases are made to cover? Where, in the authentic records of any
          Christian missionary labors, throughout the world, Pa pal or
          Protestant, is there such an experience? I confidently believe,
          nowhere. No such case can be cited. No such experience is recorded or
          known. On the other hand we can produce two, each beyond challenge for
          simplicity and integrity, though very opposite in personal conditions
          and circumstances, of men who found in their own independent search of
          the Bible, the one in the original languages in which it was written,
          the other in a translation into his vernacular tongue, the doctrine of
          the strict simple Unity of God, the Father, and the subordination and
          inferiority therefore of our blessed Lord.</p>
          <p>I refer to the late Rajah Ram Mohun Roy, at Calcutta, and William
          Roberts, at Madras. The one, a high-caste Brahmin, accomplished in all
          the learning of the Orient; having every advantage of wealth, social
          position, and personal culture. The other, a native of the lowest
          caste, the servant of an English resident merchant, uneducated,
          obscure, and poor. The latter read the Bible in a translation into his
          own tongue, but could not find there the doctrine which the Liturgy of
          his master's Church, the Church of England, embodied, but only our own
          simple Unitarian faith. The former sought the Hebrew and Greek
          Scriptures, and studied them profoundly, with the same result. The
          Baptist Mission House at Serampore, of which Dr. Marshman was at the
          head, anxious to show him his mistake, detailed, as their most learned
          associate, the Rev. Wm. Adam, to confer with and convince the Rajah of
          his error, and lead him to the truth. But lo! the Rajah refuted his
          teacher, and converted Mr. Adam to Unitarianism; and when the Rev. Mr.
          Schmidt of the Baptist Mission, and Dr. Marshman, saw fit to
          animadvert in The Friend of India, of which the latter was editor.
          upon the first Christian publication of Ram Mohun Roy, entitled
          "The Precepts of Jesus," etc., being extracts from the
          discourses of our Lord, a discussion arose between the Rajah and Dr.
          M., in which the former showed himself a most skilful, able, and
          learned critic, and as a controversialist displayed the most generous
          Christian temper. His "Final Appeal" closed the controversy.
          Such cases, though they do not absolutely prove the truth of
          Unitarianism, do yet, especially in the absence of similar cases on
          the opposite side, increase the antecedent probability that it has a
          prevailing Scripture basis, and in the Christian Church has a right to
          be.</p>
          <p>Where, then, do we stand? We desire, we aim to get back to the
          original, simple, primitive Christianity the Christianity of Christ
          and his Apostles; to recover the faith which was in the beginning,
          long before the age of Systematic Theology. Systematic Theology what
          is it the world over, but the piling up of human opinions?
          "Jesus," says Hagenbach, "is not the author of a
          dogmatic theology, but the'author and finisher of our faith'; not the
          founder of a school, but emphatically the founder of religion and of
          the Church." Again he says: "The first disciples of the Lord
          were, like their Master, far from propounding dogmatic systems."
          Our appeal, therefore, is finally and confidently to the Scriptures.
          We hold no peculiar or distinguishing doctrine which cannot be stated
          in the express, unaltered, unqualified words of Holy Writ; a thing
          which our Trinitarian brethren cannot do for theirs.</p>
          <p>But we are charged with holding mere denials, with holding a purely
          negative faith. We answer that we do deny, in every way and form in
          which it is ever stated by those from whom we differ, the Trinity. We
          do deny that God subsists in Three Persons, in every intelligible or
          proper sense of that expression. But is this all? Have we nothing but
          denials, negations? Far, very far from it. We affirm as distinctly, as
          emphatically as any, a positive, Scriptural faith. We affirm the
          strict, simple, undivided Unity of GOD. We affirm that He is One
          Person, One Being, One Conscious Intelligence. We affirm that the
          FATHER alone is the GOD of the New Testament. We affirm that to Him
          only are our prayers, supplications, confessions, adoration,
          thanksgivings, praises, our supreme homage and worship due. And
          finally, we affirm our full and unquestioning faith in the Father, in
          the Son, and in the Holy Ghost; we affirm it as sincerely, devoutly,
          heartily, gratefully, as any who bear the Christian name, and call
          Christ Master and Lord.</p>
          <p>Thus denying, and thus affirming, we stand fast by our faith. Our
          confidence is in God, who is "able to make us stand."
          "To his own Master" we know and rejoice that "each
          standeth or falleth." While, therefore, we repudiate all that
          weak human presumption which might wish or attempt to rule us out of
          the Christian Church, "by the grace of God" our place is
          there, and there we mean to stay. But we rejoice that we stand,
          however firm and unquestioning in our own positive faith, on a broad
          and generous platform of hope for the world, and the largest charity.
          We have neither hard names nor harsh treatment for any from whom we
          dissent. We see alike in all, the children of One God, the Universal
          Father of the one great family on earth and in heaven. Differ we may,
          nay, differ we must, on many points from our orthodox brethren; but
          differ as we may, we agree, too, in far more, and those the more
          important ones, would they but be just and informed. We will hold our
          differences firmly in proportion as they seem to us important, but
          even then charitably. And we will pray and strive, as the great
          consummation, that we may thus "all come at length into the unity
          of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect
          man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</p>
