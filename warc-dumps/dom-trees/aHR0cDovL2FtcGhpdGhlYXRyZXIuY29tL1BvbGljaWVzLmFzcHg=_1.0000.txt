<b>General.</b> <i>Online Ticket Orders Broker</i> (hereto known as SITE) acts as an intermediary between buyers and ticket sellers (defined below) to facilitate the purchase and sale of event tickets, and as such is not directly involved in the actual ticket sale transaction between the buyers and TICKET SELLERS.  All sales are final.  As tickets sold through SITE are often obtained through the secondary market and prices are determined by the individual ticket seller, the prices for tickets may be above or below face value.  The following are the rules or "TERMS" that govern use of the OnlineTicketOrders.com Web Site ("SITE") by you, the USER of the SITE ("USER"). By using or visiting the SITE, USER expressly agrees to be bound by these TERMS and to follow these TERMS and all applicable laws and regulations governing the SITE. SITE reserves the right to change these TERMS at any time, effective immediately upon posting on the SITE. If USER violates these TERMS SITE may terminate USER's access to the SITE, bar USER from future use of the SITE, cancel USER's ticket order, and/or take appropriate legal action against USER.
<br><br><b>Above Face Value.</b>
Tickets sold through SITE are often obtained through secondary market TICKET SELLERS and are being resold, in many cases, above the price or "face value" listed on the ticket. All ticket prices include additional service charges and handling fees as defined on each order.  SITE and its TICKET SELLERS are not directly affiliated with any performer, sports team, or venue; and SITE does not act as a primary sale box office, unless otherwise stated.  By agreeing to these TERMS, USER agrees that the purchase price for tickets on their order does not reflect the original purchase price of the ticket and may be either higher or lower than the original purchase price.
<br><br><b>Orders. </b>
Orders placed through SITE will be fulfilled by one of our network of participating TICKET SELLERS. Contact information for the TICKET SELLER who fulfills USER's order (hereinafter known as "FULFILLER") will be provided to USER upon completion of the purchase process. If this information is lost, USER may contact SITE to retrieve information about the order. 
<br><br><b>All sales are final. </b>
Since tickets are a one-of-a-kind item and not replaceable, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations. If an event is postponed, tickets will be honored for the rescheduled date. New tickets will not need to be issued. If an event is cancelled without a rescheduled date, User will need to contact the FULFILLER for a refund. The FULFILLER may require the User to return the supplied tickets at User's expense before receiving any refund User is entitled to due to cancellation. SITE is not responsible for providing or securing this refund for User. Any shipping and handling charges are not refundable. Refunds will be processed in the same currency as the original order. Conversion charges, including though not exhaustive of the ones issued by USER's bank, if any, are not covered by OnlineTicketOrders.com or Fulfiller.  Neither OnlineTicketOrders.com nor the FULFILLER will issue exchanges or refunds after a purchase has been made or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. When User receives tickets, User should keep them in a safe place. Please note that direct sunlight or heat may damage tickets.
<br><br><b>Pricing. </b>
All prices are in United States Dollars (USD) unless otherwise specifically stated.  SITE cannot confirm the price of an item until after an order is completed by USER. Despite SITE's best efforts, a small number of the items listed on the SITE may be priced incorrectly. If the FULFILLER discovers an item's correct price is higher than the stated price, the FULFILLER will either complete the order at the original price, contact USER to inform them of different price with an option to purchase, or cancel USER's order and notify USER of such cancellation. 
<br><br><b>Taxes. </b>
Prices stated on the SITE do not include any state or other local taxes that may apply to USER's order.  TICKET SELLERS may collect sales tax as is appropriate for their locality. 
<br><br><b>Credit Card Charges. </b>
USER's credit card will be charged by the FULFILLER responsible for fulfilling their order and not SITE. If USER have any questions about charges on USER credit card statement, feel free to contact us at TicketSupport@TicketNetwork.com or to direct USER question to FULFILLER responsible for completing the ticket order. FULFILLER may charge or authorize USERS credit card in advance of confirming ticket availability. If tickets are ultimately found to be unavailable, the USERS credit card will not be charged or USER will receive a full refund for the charged amount. 
<br><br><b>Event Listings.</b>
SITE does not guarantee the accuracy of event information on SITE including but not limited to event name, event location or venue, event start time, or event date.
<br><br><b>Ticket Holder Behavior Policy.</b>
The USER agrees to abide by all rules and policies of the venue where the event is located relating to conduct and behavior.  Should the USER be ejected from the event for failure to abide by the venue's rules and policies, USER shall be subject to all applicable fines and legal or other expenses associated with the ejection.  Further, should the ejection result in the loss of the TICKET SELLER's right to use any other season tickets at that venue, or the right to purchase other tickets from that venue, USER shall be held liable for all reasonable costs, expenses, and losses associated with said loss, including but not limited to all direct, indirect, vicarious, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages, including lost profits.
<br><br><b>Ticket Availability.</b>
SITE cannot guarantee ticket availability until the USER is in possession of their tickets. Generally, all ticket listings on SITE are a unique set of tickets from an individual TICKET SELLER. Some ticket listings on SITE may only be representations of available tickets and not actual seat locations or currently available tickets. Occasionally tickets ordered may no longer be available at the price or in the quantity originally ordered at the time the order is received. If equivalent or better seat locations are available at the same price, the TICKET SELLER will fill the order with the alternative seat locations. If no alternates are available, either the USER'S credit card will not be charged at all or the entire amount will be refunded, and USER will be notified that the ticket request has been rejected.   
<br><br><b> Fraudulent Use.</b>
In order to protect our USERs from fraud, a USER may be required to provide additional proof of identify on any order. Proof of identity may include but is not limited to a signed credit card authorization and/or photocopies of public documents such as a state driver's license or federal passport.
<br><br><b> Shipping.</b>
All orders are shipped to USER using the delivery method chosen for the order. All shipments are to the billing address of USERS credit card (no exceptions). Shipments may require direct signature at the point of delivery.  
<br><br><b> Delayed Shipment.</b>
Event tickets are generally delivered according to the delivery method selected at the time of ticket checkout. Most orders are shipped the same business day in which they are received or, if placed after business hours, orders may be shipped on the next business day. However, tickets may not always be available for immediate delivery, particularly in cases when the tickets have been purchased far in advance of the event in question or for certain events including but not limited to the following: all off-season orders for professional sporting leagues, concerts, and Las Vegas events tickets. While most tickets are delivered within three business days of the delivery method chosen, this does not imply a guaranteed delivery date.  In these situations tickets may be marked with an estimated ship date. USER will be provided with account access information that will allow them to view the status of their order and tracking information, if available, after purchase. In the case where tracking information is not available USER may contact a representative of the FULFILLER for shipment information or an estimated delivery date. Tickets will be shipped when available, and choice of an expedited delivery method does not guarantee that tickets will be shipped immediately. USER should check the notes in the ticket listings and the seller's comments and delivery box information after selecting a delivery method on the checkout page for the estimated delivery date and detailed information about the ticket delivery dates and methods.   
<br><br><b>International Shipping.</b>
Customers outside of the United States must choose an International Delivery option. If a domestic shipping option is chosen for an order to be shipped outside the United States, the shipping cost will be adjusted by the FULILLER after the order is placed to use the International Rate.
<br><br><b> Delivery Verification.</b>
If USER specifies a shipping address that does not allow for Delivery Verification, such as a Post Office Box, USER may be required to pay an additional fee to cover the additional risks associated with this type of order. If such a shipping address is used, the FULFILLER will, at their discretion, either contact USER about the additional fee prior to shipping or cancel USER's order and notify USER of such cancellation.
