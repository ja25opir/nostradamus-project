		<h4>College&nbsp;welcomes two new deans</h4>
<p><strong>Nov. 2008</strong>. Following months of reviewing considerations, recommendations and interviews, Anoka Technical College named a veteran faculty member as the interim dean of academic resources and a director of an online college as a dean of academics. Mary Ann Jackels and Kathy Doty began their appointments in late November. </p>
<p>Historically, the college has had only one dean of academics, but because of the various dean responsibilities and many challenges that evolve with higher education, the college leadership believed it was in the best interest of the college community to hire a second dean. "Overcoming the challenges facing higher education is a continuous process at Anoka Tech," said John Cacich, vice president of academic resoources and student affairs. "The college needs additional dean support as it explores innovative ways to expand college access, keep college affordable and increase opportunities for lifelong education." </p>
<p>Doty brings eight years of higher education experience to Anoka Technical College. Her career resume includes Campus Director at Rasmussen College and most recently Director of Academic Advising at Walden University, an online university in Minneapolis. Doty was at Walden University when the university was experiencing unforeseen growth. Amid a time of accelerated growth and unknowns, Doty restructured Walden’s academic advising department and readjusted priorities and workflow. In announcing the new dean selection, Cacich said, "Kathy’s impressive credentials in working at a private and at an online college will be pivotal to our future course." </p>
<p>Doty will fuse her career experiences with her new responsibilities of overseeing several academic programs, expanding delivery strategies to include more online, night and weekend programs, and strengthening the partnership with the Anoka–Hennepin Secondary Technical Education Program. Doty said Anoka Tech is a place where her commitment to advancing higher education and an institution’s vision are integrally linked. "My goal is to build on the foundation Anoka Tech already has in place. Student learning should never be stagnant; education can always be improved."</p>
<p>Doty earned a bachelor’s degree in education from Augsburg College in Minneapolis and a master’s of education degree in curriculum development from the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota. </p>
<p>Anoka Tech recently named veteran faculty member, Mary Ann Jackels, as the interim dean of academic resources. Jackels succeeds Leo Christenson, who left the position to spend more time with his family. Jackels joined Anoka Tech as an instructor in the Health Information Technology program in 1991. During her tenure, she actively participated in various college committees, which include the enrollment management committee, the program enhancement task force and the faculty shared governance committee. She also served on the book services task force that implemented a book rental program at the college. </p>
<p>"While I am obviously sad to be leaving the classroom and teaching," said Jackels, "I am greatly looking forward to the new opportunities and challenges the dean position holds." Jackels will be responsible for integrating and streamlining student recruitment, admissions and retention efforts. She will also oversee the academic resource center, student support services and transition coordinators. </p>
<p>One of Jackels’ immediate objectives is to compile data and trend information about current and prospective students to discover and understand historical enrollment patterns and to boost current enrollment at the college. Cacich lauded the breadth of Jackels’ experience in data research and management. "Mary Ann's experience in drawing realistic conclusions from statistical analysis will bring our strategic enrollment efforts to a whole new level," said Cacich. </p>
<p>Jackels has a bachelor’s degree in health information administration from the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota and a master’s degree in education from Capella University.</p>

<p>Three employees at Anoka Technical College rec<img vspace="10" border="10" hspace="10" width="210" alt="Jeff Daniel and  Anne on QCTV Tech Talk" src="../images/JeffDanAnne%202008.jpg" height="128" align="right">ently put aside their fears of TV cameras, microphones and hot lights for the sake of the college. On Friday, Nov. 14, Jeff Stephenson, Anne Weyandt and Daniel Truchon met at the Quad City Television (QCTV) studios, off Highway 169, to video tape the first episode of Tech Talk with Anoka Technical College. Tech Talk is a 30-minute cable television show that introduces viewers to the programs and services at Anoka Technical College as well as gives them a closer look at higher education. </p>
<p>December’s show features general education instructor Jeff Stephenson interviewing college President Anne Weyandt and Electronic Engineering Technology (EET) program instructor Daniel Truchon. Stephenson and Weyandt kick off the first episode by talking about the programs and services offered at Anoka Tech, about the increase in enrollment and about the college’s new mission and vision. </p>
<p>After a short commercial break that features additional information about the college - winter break dates, online classes that are available and start dates – Stephenson and Truchon paint a picture of the Electronic Engineering Technology program. Truchon describes the curriculum, what EET students will learn and do, and&nbsp;EET&nbsp;career paths.&nbsp;</p><b></b>
<p>Later in the week video crews were on campus videotaping EET classroom activities to use as B-roll. B-roll is supplemental or alternate footage intercut with the main shot in an interview. The B-roll technique cuts away to footage of what the interviewee is talking about while a different camera zooms in, then cuts back, after the zoom is complete.</p>
<p>Each monthly program will highlight a different topic relevant to higher education as well as showcase a different college program. The show will air approximately 300 times throughout the month on QCTV channel 16. Other cable stations that collaborate with QCTV may also air the show. QCTV is a non-profit organization that provides information on government and community activities for the Cities of Anoka, Andover, Champlin, and Ramsey. After December, the show will be on YouTube and on the college’s Web site. </p>
<p>The January 2009 show will feature the Machine Trades program and how a technical education can help in today’s harsh economic times. General Education instructor Jennifer Bingle will interview President Weyandt and instructors Jerry Showalter and Jesse Oldenburg.</p>

<h4><a class="anchorGlyph" name="Judicial Reporting students preserve history"></a>Students in Judicial Reporting program help preserve history</h4>
<p>Oct. 27, 2008, Anoka, MN - Students in the Judicial Reporting program at Anoka Technical College will hear stories about friendships destroyed by bloodshed, about courageous heroes who fought for freedom and about unselfish hearts of civilian workers who served American soldiers in combat, as they record the memories of American war veterans for the Veterans History Project (VHP). </p>
<p>The Judicial Reporting program is inviting American war veterans to campus on Saturday, November 8 to share their wartime experiences. From 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., first-year Judicial Reporting students will interview veterans from World War II, the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and the conflicts in Afghanistan&nbsp;and Iraq. They will ask veterans questions about why they enlisted, the actions they witnessed, their emotions relating to combat and about returning home. Second-year Judicial Reporting students and volunteer working reporters will record and transcribe the stories for the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>“A project in which students interview and record stories from American veterans has many benefits, said Jennifer Sati, program director for the Judicial Reporting and Captioning Programs at Anoka Technical College. “Veterans can pass on the lessons that they have learned, thereby ensuring that their experiences will extend long into the future and the students get a glimpse of history as well as interviewing and transcribing practice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Created in 2000 by the United States Congress, the purpose of&nbsp;the VHP is to collect and archive the personal recollections of United States wartime veterans to honor their service and share their stories. The project also collects stories from homefront civilians who worked in support of armed forces. </p>
<p>If you are an American war veteran and you would like to have your memoirs recorded for the American Folklife Center, contact Deb Longley at (763) 576-4848 or at <a target="_self" href="mailto:dlongley@anokatech" title="">dlongley@anokatech</a>.</p>

<h4>New Executive Director of MnCEME visits Anoka Tech</h4>
<p>After only three days of assuming his position, the new Executive Director of MnCEME, Dr. Ron Bennett, hit the floor with both feet churning. The director made Anoka Technical College the first stop on his tour of MnCEME member campuses. Bennet spent the morning with John Cacich, vice president of academic and student affairs and MnCEME project leader, Bob Evans, talking about past MnCEME projects and what MnCEME should look like in the future. </p>
<p>Cacich and Evans briefed Bennet on grant competition between MnCEME member colleges - </p>
<p>Anoka Tech has won over $300,000 - about MnCEME helping move articulation agreements forward and the increased visibility of the two-year member campuses. Cacich and Evans also suggested that the center narrow its focus to better concentrate on completion of projects already underway.</p>
<p>Bennett recently retired as the Founding Dean of the School of Engineering at the University of St. Thomas, where he was able to bring national visibility to its engineering programs. </p>
<p>"The Minnesota Center for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence will have renewed energy under the leadership of Dr. Bennett and Associate Executive Director Judith Evans, said Bob Evans. "And Anoka Tech will continue to play a vital role in the center."<br></p>
<h4>College seeks MnSCU approval of new mission and vision</h4>
<p>After facilitating numerous focus groups, a community blog and discussions on word choice, representatives from Anoka Technical College will present its new mission and vision statements to the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities Systems (MnSCU) Board of Trustees (BOT).</p>
<p>In keeping with the college’s strategic plan the mission is to <strong>provide innovative career and technical education to help our students and communities live and learn well</strong>. </p>
<p>The vision statement declares that Anoka Technical College is <strong>a vital student-and community-focused institution, providing the finest career and technical education in Minnesota</strong>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sept. 16, Anoka Technical College President Anne Weyandt, Vice Presidents John Cacich and David Jeffrey along with two students and two faculty members, will ask the BOT to approve the technical school’s new mission and vision. The college must have an official mission and vision approved by the BOT in order to maintain its higher education accreditation.<br><br>Gettingthe BOTs approval marks the end of many months of collecting ideas and thoughts from faculty, staff and students and from the college’s community partners, said Cacich. "Integrating the ideas and thoughts of the people at the very core of the institution to create a vision and mission is a common practice at colleges and universities," said the Vice President of Academic and Student Affairs. "But it is a practice that is very different than what was used to create Anoka Tech’s previous mission and vision." College officials are speculating that the previous mission and vision statements were created about 15&nbsp; years ago<b>.</b></p>
<p>The new mission and vision do not redefine the direction of the college but rather provide a foundation for 2008 and beyond, said Weyandt. "The new mission and vision unite the college to move toward the same goals&nbsp; and ideas. The process that we used re-centers us in the longer, broader vision of whom and what we are and what we want to do in the future."</p>
<h4>Teaching and Learning Day scheduled for the end of September</h4>
<p>The 2nd annual Teaching and Learning Day will be Sept. 25, from 1:15 to 3:15 p.m. in auditorium A. </p>
<p>Linda Baer, the MnSCU senior vice chancellor of academic and student affairs, and Dr. Mark Milliron will facilitate an interactive dialogue about transcendent learning and the simple charge of living the process. Representatives from four program areas – trades, general education, health and adult learners (Corporate Center) - will highlight how they have incorporated transcendent learning outcomes into their classrooms. </p>
<p>During the two-hour discussion, participants will share ideas and learn how educators can prepare for demographic, economic, educational, and technological transformations. Milliron will also examine a set of transcendent learning outcomes–critical, creative, social, and courageous learning.<br></p>
<h4><a class="anchorGlyph" name="Textbook rental program starts strong"></a>Textbook rental program has a strong start </h4>
<p>At a time when students at Anoka Technical College are paying almost $4 for a gallon of gasoline and $7 for a case of soda, many found reprieve in renting their required textbooks through the college’s new textbook rental project.</p>
<p>This fall students could rent textbooks in select first-year English, math and reading courses. "We rented approximately 530 textbooks to about 390 students this semester," said Karen Onken, accounting supervisor. "If the exact books stay in the rental program for four semesters, potentially1600 students could benefit from the project. The aggregate savings to students would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $33,000."</p>
<p>For a modest rental fee, students received their textbook(s) on the first day of class and saved as much as $100 per course in textbook cost. Although students were asked to avoid writing in the books, many seemed to think saving money far outweighed the inconvenience of not be able to highlight sentences. </p>
<p>The pilot textbook rental program was the result of the Student Senate, Anoka Tech faculty and staff working together to lower the high cost of textbooks. The project seed money was a MnSCU/legislatively-funded appropriation to address student textbook affordability.</p>
<h4>Anoka Tech builds relationships on a golf course</h4>
<p>For the second consecutive year, Anoka Technical College is inviting friends of the college to join them in a golf tournament on Wednesday, Sept. 24, at Greenhaven Golf Course. Making a play on the word fundraiser, the purpose the golf tournament is not to raise funds but to build relationships. "The golf tournament is not a revenue generating event," said David Jeffrey, one of the coordinators of the event. "The event is celebrating another year of providing innovative career and technical education to our students and to the community."</p>
<p>The shotgun scramble time is 12 p.m. The $50 registration fee includes 18 holes of golf on the beautiful Greenhaven Golf Course in Anoka, a cart and hors d’oeuvres. There will be an awards ceremony when players finish their rounds of play. </p>

<h3><a class="anchorGlyph" name="Nursing Assistant program receives $25K"></a>Nursing Assistant Program receives $25,000</h3>
<p>July 23, 2008 -Anoka Technical College faculty member, Jean Jurek, recently got a surprise phone call from Los Angeles, California, that left her smiling and crying. On July 25, Jurek learned that syndicated talk show host, Jenny Jones, was giving the Anoka Technical College nursing assistant program a $25,000 grant in honor of Jurek’s good friend and coworker Sue Hanson. Hanson,&nbsp;a nursing assistant instructor and department chairperson, was tragically killed in automobile accident in 2005.</p>
<p>Since Hanson’s death, Jurek has been working diligently to honor her friend’s memory and dedication to students by raising&nbsp;money to support scholarships and equipment for the nursing assistant program. Jurek has coordinated college-wide efforts to raise funds through Avon and Pampered Chef parties, cookbook sales and bagging groceries at a local grocery store. Jurek has raised over $10,000 in Sue Hanson’s memory.</p>
<p>Jurek’s efforts really paid off after her sister told her about a special grant program through the Jenny Jones Foundation. Jurek applied for a $25,000 grant to fulfill her best friend’s dream of upgrading the training equipment at the college where they both worked. Jurek wrote, "Please help make Sue’s dream come true." After reading Jurek’s application, Jones told one of Jurek’s colleagues, "Jean’s story really touched my heart." </p>
<p>Jurek was shocked and elated when she learned she had been chosen as a Jenny’s Hero recipient. "I am so pleased that this will keep Sue’s memory alive and help achieve her dream for the students at Anoka Tech," said Jurek. </p>
<p>The Jenny Jones Foundation was established in 2005 as a means to provide assistance to those in need. Primary areas of focus are education, women’s health, and improving communities throughout the country.<br></p>
<h4>Anoka Tech&nbsp;wins award for trucking program</h4>
<p>June 2008 - Anoka Technical College recently received an award from the Minnesota Council for Continuing Education and Customized Training for designing an innovative truck driving pre-apprenticeship program, but returning Veterans will reap the greatest reward. The program offers returning Veterans the opportunity to take over-the-road truck driving training while earning a salary that is comparable to a full-time over-the-road truck driver! </p>
<p>"Two years in the making, the pre-apprenticeship program is unique in that there is only one other program like it in the nation," said David Jeffrey, vice president for community and economic development at Anoka Technical College. The program is a partnership of state and federal agencies, a community employer and two Minnesota State College and University System institutions. </p>
<p>Created by Anoka Technical College, the Department of Labor, Veterans Administration, Anderson Trucking Services and St. Cloud Technical College, the pre-apprenticeship program allows Veterans to utilize and transfer the skills they learned in the Military to civilian workforce. </p>
<p>"The Truck Driving Industry is experiencing a shortage of experienced drivers," said Jeffrey. "The program gives Veterans credit for their military training and experience while complimenting the truck driving industry." </p>
<p>During pre-apprenticeship program, drivers will become more familiar and comfortable with backing up, shifting gears and logging their hours and miles on the road. Before students can apply for the over-the-road truck driving apprenticeship with Anderson Trucking Services in St. Cloud, instructors from Anoka Tech and Anderson Trucking will individually assess their skills. </p>
<p>For more information about the pre-apprenticeship program, contact Judy Manetas at Anoka Technical College (763) 576-4793.</p>
<p>Welding students at Anoka Tech take top honors</p>
<p>On February 11, nine welding students from Anoka Tech competed in a welding contest called <b>Behind the Mask</b>. This yearly contest attracts welders from around the state; the competitors are both welding students and industry personnel. At the end of the night, four students placed in the three top spots:</p>
<p>2nd place in Oxy - Fuel cutting = Max Bowers, 2nd year student</p>
<p>3rd place in Oxy - Fuel cutting = Carles Hoiland, 1st year student</p>
<p>2nd place in Flux-Core welding = Alex Wickstrom, 2nd year student</p>
<p>3rd place in Flux-Core welding = Steve Swenson, 1st year student</p>
<p>Seven Anoka Tech students were also contest helpers along with welding instructor Jay Gerdin. Robert Sand, STEP instructor also participated as a Certified Welding Inspector. The students at Anoka Tech are now focusing on the SkillsUSA state competition on April 10.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Great River Energy provides crisis grants to students</h4>
<p>Great River Energy recently awarded the foundation at Anoka Technical College $1,500 for student crisis grants. Crisis grants offer financial relief to students experiencing a sudden and unexpected financial crisis for which no other sources of assistance&nbsp;are available. An ongoing supporter of the Anoka Technical College and of the college foundation, last year Great River Energy funded a grant of $2,500 for digital multi-meters for the electronics department. "We deeply appreciate Great River Energy’s leadership in supporting technical education. It is through ongoing support&nbsp;from community partners like Great River Energy that we are able to continue to serve our students and area employers," said Tess DeGeest, director of resource development at Anoka Technical College.</p>
<h4>Judicial reporting students help preserve history - again</h4>
<p>For the second consecutive year, the Judicial Reporting program at Anoka Technical College will record narratives from wartime veterans for the Veterans History Program, a project of the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. The mission of the Veteran History Project is to collect and archive the personal recollections of U.S. wartime veterans to honor their service and share their stories with current and future generations. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Nov. 7, from 1 to 4 p.m., Judicial Reporting students will interview veterans from World War II, the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Veterans will talk about why they enlisted, the actions they witnessed, their emotional state during combat and about returning home. Second-year Judicial Reporting students and volunteer working reporters will record the historical stories using steno writers.</p>
<p>If you know of a veteran who is willing to share his/her story and have it recorded for the Veterans History Project, contact Deb Longley at <a href="mailto:dlongley@anokatech.edu"><u>dlongley@anokatech.edu</u></a>. </p>
<h4>Anoka Technical College’s fall enrollment is record breaking</h4>
<p>Aug. 24, 2009 - Anoka, MN – At the start of the fall semester, Anoka Technical College reports a record-breaking enrollment. The college’s fall 2009 enrollment is record breaking in two ways: first, according to college historians, it is the highest enrollment in more than 15 years; second, it is 23 percent higher than it was at the same time last year. <br><br>An early report from the college indicates 2,175 students are taking classes this fall. The college anticipates enrollment will increase even more as additional learners enroll and register in September to take advantage of classes that start in the middle of the semester. Anoka Tech’s fall 2008 enrollment was 1,748. <br><br>Anne Weyandt, president of Anoka Technical College, is pleased with the early enrollment increase. She credits the college’s ability to offer high quality, affordable technical educational opportunities that are fast, focused and flexible along with a re-aligned admissions processes that makes getting into college and getting an education as easy and as painless as possible, as the two primary factors behind the record-breaking numbers.</p>
<p>"The unprecedented increases in enrollment at Anoka Tech over the past three terms not only reflect the state of our national and regional economy," said Weyandt who added that "increased interest and enrollment in technical programs is indicative of the popularity of career education in meeting the needs of the current and future workforce. In addition, ATC's intentional emphasis on programs and services that meet the needs of adult learners and dislocated workers--expressed in the Next STEP initiative--helps students flexibly transition back into college." <br><br>President Weyandt also noted that the College has made substantial adjustments to accommodate the surge in enrollment: "our late afternoon and evening information sessions, drop-in admissions appointment schedule, expanded financial aid program and a variety of late start courses and online education options help make college accessible and affordable to those in our community in most need of our offerings in challenging economic times."</p>
<p>While the college celebrates what it has accomplished since last fall, Weyandt said staff and faculty will carry the positive momentum into the new academic year as they continue to serve students and to provide innovative career and technical education to help students live and learn well. <br><br></p>
<h3>Summer enrollment heats up</h3>
<p><strong>May 2009.</strong> During a time of year when people find tranquility at a quiet lake in northern Minnesota or in sipping a glass of lemonade under an old oak tree, many people found peace of mind in getting a technical education at Anoka Technical College. The college recently reported Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) for the summer semester were 25 percent higher than last summer. One FTE is equal to 30 credits. </p>
<p>College President Anne Weyandt credits the enrollment surge to a variety of student-focused strategies to bring people to Anoka Tech. "Anoka Tech’s continued strong enrollment growth reflects the alignment of our programming with student and community needs, particularly in difficult economic times," said Weyandt. "Our Next STEP initiative eases transition back into college for dislocated workers and is an example of a very strong partnership with our local workforce centers. Our local economy depends on the availability of skilled workers and it is our job to prepare students for emerging career options, especially in times of challenging and shifting work force needs." </p>
<h3>Anoka Tech helps the unemployed</h3>
<p><strong>June 2009.</strong> On June 16 and 17, over 20 representatives from the Central Minnesota Jobs &amp; Training Services (11 sites) and from the Anoka County WorkForce Center went to Anoka Technical College to learn more about the college and about an educational pathway for dislocated workers. The college also used the time to thank the workforce centers (WFCs) for supporting the college mission and to learn how the college can better serve unemployed individuals. </p>
<p>During the visits, the representatives listened to a testimonial from a dislocated worker, and were introduced to the Admissions process and to the Corporate Center. The afternoon ended with a tour of the campus. </p>
<h3>Two new Natural Science courses in fall 2009</h3>

<h4>Anoka Technical College provides college courses and hope to dislocated workers</h4>
<p><strong>March 11, 2009 Anoka, MN</strong> - During a time when people have had a torrent of bad news and they are reeling from never-ending reports of financial and economic disasters, Anoka Technical College announces an innovative program that gives dislocated workers new skills and education and provides a sense of hope. The technical college, just 30 miles north of the Twin Cities, recently created Next STEP, a fast, flexible and focused pathway program for people who suddenly find themselves in dislocated worker programs. </p>
<p>The purpose of Next STEP, which is an acronym for Successful Transitions for Experienced Populations, is trouble free, said Anne Weyandt, president of Anoka Technical College. "Next STEP aligns our college programs and services with the Anoka County Workforce Center outreach efforts to create a seamless set of educational opportunities for dislocated workers and other adults seeking career and retraining options." </p>
<p>A unique concept of Next STEP is that it gives people an opportunity to start taking technical college classes at various times of the semester. The principle veers from the tradition of starting college classes at the beginning of the semester. "Instead of turning dislocated workers away and telling them they have to wait until summer of fall to start school," said Weyandt, "we are telling them they can start working on their diploma, degree or certificate today." </p>
<p>The academic programs with alternative start times include the Medical Assistant, Information Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology and Construction Electrician programs; the Manufacturing and Automotive programs will have summer start dates. </p>
<p>Not all of the programs at the college are offering </p>
