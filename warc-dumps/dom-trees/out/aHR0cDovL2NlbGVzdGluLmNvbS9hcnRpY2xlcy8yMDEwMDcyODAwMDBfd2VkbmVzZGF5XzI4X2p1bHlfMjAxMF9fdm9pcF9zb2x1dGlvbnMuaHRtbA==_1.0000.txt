<b>Wednesday 28 July 2010 - VOIP Solutions</b><br>

</font></p><p><font face="ms sans serif, geneva, arial">


I've considered VOIP solutions for me personally, and my business secondarily. You
can use "poor man's" VOIP if you go to Radio Shack and buy that MagicJack product,
but I haven't heard really excellent reviews of it...

</font></p><p><font face="ms sans serif, geneva, arial">

My friend has one, and I tried making a call with it, and the latency was so bad, I
might as well have been speaking to myself. Goodness knows, I sounded like I was
doing it while I was using it. I searched around the Internet today for some more
news about VOIP to see if things have improved and ventured across <a href="http://www.truvoipbuzz.com/">truVoIPbuzz</a>, which is a blog dedicated to
VOIP. There is lots of good information there if you've ever considered VOIP or
might consider it in the future. I plan on visiting often, as it looks like there
are regular posts there with new information every few days.

I'm not an artist myself. At least not one with any talent. I suppose we are all
artists. I've often thought it would be great to be able to give people a
personalized gift of some kind for those special occasions. Once, I even thought of
painting a modern masterpiece for each of my friends to give to them for Christmas.
That was a monster of a bad idea. Instead, I should have gone someplace like <a href="http://www.icanmakeyouart.co.uk/">Pop Art Portrait</a> and had nice looking
portraits done for them instead. This company will take any photo you give them and
create a nicely designed painting of it. Had I know about this company before, I
would have definitely taken advantage of this service. Actually, Christmas does come
once a year, doesn't it?

Computers are great... they cut down the work load and they do things much faster.
They process information 1 million times faster (probably much more!) than human
beings can. And that's a HUGE plus when you are designing Forex systems. The
computer can see what the eye can't see... or better yet, the computer can find what
the naked eye can't find. But with <a href="http://forex-megadroid.planetcabinet.com/">Automated Forex System Trading</a>
you will have the best the world can offer, and then some.
