			<font color="#6B4F45">The Second Voyage, Winter at Stadacona</font><!-- #EndEditable --></h1><!-- #BeginEditable "content" -->

			<p align="left">On returning to his anchorage before Quebec, Cartier 
			found that his companions whom he had left there had not been idle. 
			The ships, it will be remembered, lay moored close to the shore at 
			the mouth of the little river Lairet, a branch of the St Charles. On 
			the bank of the river, during their leader's absence, the men had 
			erected a solid fortification or rampart. Heavy sticks of lumber had 
			been set up on end and joined firmly together, while at intervals 
			cannon, taken from the ships, had been placed in such a way as to 
			command the approach in all directions. The sequel showed that it 
			was well, indeed, for the French that they placed so little reliance 
			on the friendship of the savages.<br>
			<br>
			Donnacona was not long in putting in an appearance. Whatever may 
			have been his real feelings, the crafty old chief feigned a great 
			delight at the safe return of Cartier. At his solicitation Cartier 
			paid a ceremonial visit to the settlement of Stadacona, on October 
			13, ten days after his return. The gentlemen of the expedition, 
			together with fifty sailors, all well armed and appointed, 
			accompanied the leader. The meeting between the Indians and their 
			white visitors was similar to those already described. Indian 
			harangues and wild dancing and shouting were the order of the day, 
			while Cartier, as usual, distributed knives and trinkets. The French 
			were taken into the Indian lodges and shown the stores of food laid 
			up against the coming winter. Other objects, too, of a new and 
			peculiar interest were displayed: there were the 'scalp locks' of 
			five men--'the skin of five men's heads,' says Cartier,--which were 
			spread out on a board like parchments. The Indians explained that 
			these had been taken from the heads of five of their deadly enemies, 
			the Toudamani, a fierce people living to the south, with whom the 
			natives of Stadacona were perpetually at war.<br>
			<br>
			A gruesome story was also told of a great massacre of a war party of 
			Donnacona's people who had been on their way down to the Gaspe 
			country. The party, so the story ran, had encamped upon an island 
			near the Saguenay. They numbered in all two hundred people, women 
			and children being also among the warriors, and were gathered within 
			the shelter of a rude stockade. In the dead of night their enemies 
			broke upon the sleeping Indians in wild assault; they fired the 
			stockade, and those who did not perish in the flames fell beneath 
			the tomahawk. Five only escaped to bring the story to Stadacona. The 
			truth of the story was proved, long after the writing of Cartier's 
			narrative, by the finding of a great pile of human bones in a cave 
			on an island near Bic, not far from the mouth of the Saguenay. The 
			place is called L'Isle au Massacre to-day.<br>
			<br>
			The French now settled down into their winter quarters. They seem 
			for some time to have mingled freely with the Indians of the 
			Stadacona settlement, especially during the month which yet remained 
			before the rigor of winter locked their ships in snow and ice. 
			Cartier, being of an observing and accurate turn of mind, has left 
			in his narrative some interesting notes upon the life and ideas of 
			the savages. They had, he said, no belief in a true God. Their 
			deity, Cudragny, was supposed to tell them the weather, and, if 
			angry, to throw dust into their eyes. They thought that, when they 
			died, they would go to the stars, and after that, little by little, 
			sink with the stars to earth again, to where the happy hunting 
			grounds lie on the far horizon of the world. To correct their 
			ignorance, Cartier told them of the true God and of the verities of 
			the Christian faith. In the end the savages begged that he would 
			baptize them, and on at least one occasion a great flock of them 
			came to him, hoping to be received into the faith. But Cartier, as 
			he says, having nobody with him 'who could teach them our belief and 
			religion,' and doubting, also, the sincerity of their sudden 
			conversion, put them off with the promise that at his next coming he 
			would bring priests and holy oil and cause them to be baptized.<br>
			<br>
			The Stadacona Indians seem to have lived on terms of something like 
			community of goods. Their stock of food--including great quantities 
			of pumpkins, peas, and corn--was more or less in common. But, beyond 
			this and their lodges, their earthly possessions were few. They 
			dressed somewhat scantily in skins, and even in the depth of winter 
			were so little protected from the cold as to excite the wonder of 
			their observers. Women whose husbands died never remarried, but went 
			about with their faces smeared thick with mingled grease and soot.<br>
			<br>
			One peculiar custom of the natives especially attracted the 
			attention of their visitors, and for the oddity of the thing may 
			best be recorded in Cartier's manner. It is an early account of the 
			use of tobacco. 'There groweth also,' he wrote, 'a certain kind of 
			herb, whereof in summer they make a great provision for all the 
			year, making great account of it, and only men use it, and first 
			they cause it to be dried in the sun, then wear it about their 
			necks, wrapped in a little beast's skin made like a little bag, with 
			a hollow piece of wood or stone like a pipe. Then when they please 
			they make powder of it, and then put it in one of the ends of the 
			said cornet or pipe, and laying a coal of fire upon it, at the other 
			end suck so long that they fill their bodies full of smoke till that 
			it cometh out of their mouth and nostrils, even as out of the funnel 
			of a chimney. They say that it doth keep them warm and in health: 
			they never go without some of it about them. We ourselves have tried 
			the same smoke, and, having put it in our mouths, it seemed almost 
			as hot as pepper.'<br>
			<br>
			In spite of the going and coming of the Indians, Cartier from first 
			to last was doubtful of their intentions. Almost every day in the 
			autumn and early winter some of them appeared with eels and fish, 
			glad to exchange them for little trinkets. But the two interpreters 
			endeavored to make the Indians believe that the things given them by 
			the French were of no value, and Donnacona did his best to get the 
			Indian children out of the hands of the French. Indeed, the eldest 
			of the children, an Indian girl, escaped from the ships and rejoined 
			her people, and it was only with difficulty that Cartier succeeded 
			in getting her back again. Meanwhile a visiting chief, from the 
			country farther inland, gave the French captain to understand that 
			Donnacona and his braves were waiting only an opportunity to 
			overwhelm the ships' company. Cartier kept on his guard. He 
			strengthened the fort with a great moat that ran all round the 
			stockade. The only entry was now by a lifting bridge; and pointed 
			stakes were driven in beside the upright palisade. Fifty men, 
			divided into watches, were kept on guard all night, and, at every 
			change of the watch, the Indians, across the river in their lodges 
			of the Stadacona settlement, could hear the loud sounds of the 
			trumpets break the clear silence of the winter night.<br>
			<br>
			We have no record of the life of Cartier and his followers during 
			the winter of their isolation among the snows and the savages of 
			Quebec. It must, indeed, have been a season of dread. The northern 
			cold was soon upon them in all its rigor. The ships were frozen in 
			at their moorings from the middle of November till April 15. The ice 
			lay two fathoms thick in the river, and the driving snows and great 
			drifts blotted out under the frozen mantle of winter all sight of 
			land and water. The French could scarcely stir from their quarters. 
			Their fear of Indian treachery and their ignorance of the trackless 
			country about them held them imprisoned in their ships. A worse 
			peril was soon added. The scourge of scurvy was laid upon them--an 
			awful disease, hideous in its form and deadly in its effect. 
			Originating in the Indian camp, it spread to the ships. In December 
			fifty of the Stadacona Indians died, and by the middle of February, 
			of the hundred and ten men that made up Cartier's expedition, only 
			three or four remained in health. Eight were already dead, and their 
			bodies, for want of burial, lay frozen stark beneath the snowdrifts 
			of the river, hidden from the prying eyes of the savages. Fifty more 
			lay at the point of death, and the others, crippled and staggering 
			with the onslaught of disease, moved to and fro at their tasks, 
			their fingers numbed with cold, their hearts frozen with despair.<br>
			<br>
			The plague that had fallen upon them was such as none of them had 
			ever before seen. The legs of the sufferers swelled to huge, 
			unsightly, and livid masses of flesh. Their sinews shriveled to 
			blackened strings, pimpled with purple clots of blood. The awful 
			disease worked its way upwards. The arms hung hideous and useless at 
			the side, the mouth rotted till the teeth fell from the putrid 
			flesh. Chilled with the cold, huddled in the narrow holds of the 
			little ships fast frozen in the endless desolation of the snow, the 
			agonized sufferers breathed their last, remote from aid, far from 
			the love of women, and deprived of the consolations of the Church. 
			Let those who realize the full horror of the picture think well upon 
			what stout deeds the commonwealth of Canada has been founded.<br>
			<br>
			Without the courage and resource of their leader, whose iron 
			constitution kept him in full health, all would have been lost. 
			Cartier spared no efforts. The knowledge of his situation was 
			concealed from the Indians. None were allowed aboard the ships, and, 
			as far as might be, a great clatter of hammering was kept up 
			whenever the Indians appeared in sight, so that they might suppose 
			that Cartier's men were forced by the urgency of their tasks to 
			remain on the ships. Nor was spiritual aid neglected. An image of 
			the Virgin Mary was placed against a tree about a bow-shot from the 
			fort, and to this all who could walk betook themselves in procession 
			on the Sunday when the sickness was at its height. They moved in 
			solemn order, singing as they went the penitential psalms and the 
			Litany, and imploring the intercession of the Virgin. Thus passed 
			the days until twenty-five of the French had been laid beneath the 
			snow. For the others there seemed only the prospect of death from 
			disease or of destruction at the hands of the savages.<br>
			<br>
			It happened one day that Cartier was walking up and down by himself 
			upon the ice when he saw a band of Indians coming over to him from 
			Stadacona. Among them was the interpreter Domagaya, whom Cartier had 
			known to be stricken by the illness only ten days before, but who 
			now appeared in abundant health. On being asked the manner of his 
			cure, the interpreter told Cartier that he had been healed by a 
			beverage made from the leaves and bark of a tree. Cartier, as we 
			have seen, had kept from the Indians the knowledge of his troubles, 
			for he dared not disclose the real weakness of the French. Now, 
			feigning that only a servant was ill, he asked for details of the 
			remedy, and, when he did so, the Indians sent their women to fetch 
			branches of the tree in question. The bark and leaves were to be 
			boiled, and the drink thus made was to be taken twice a day. The 
			potion was duly administered, and the cure that it effected was so 
			rapid and so complete that the pious Cartier declared it a real and 
			evident miracle. 'If all the doctors of Lorraine and Montpellier had 
			been there with all the drugs of Alexandria,' he wrote, 'they could 
			not have done as much in a year as the said tree did in six days.' 
			An entire tree--probably a white spruce--was used up in less than 
			eight days. The scourge passed and the sailors, now restored to 
			health, eagerly awaited the coming of the spring.<br>
			<br>
			Meanwhile the cold lessened; the ice about the ships relaxed its 
			hold, and by the middle of April they once more floated free. But a 
			new anxiety had been added. About the time when the fortunes of 
			Cartier's company were at their lowest, Donnacona had left his camp 
			with certain of his followers, ostensibly to spend a fortnight in 
			hunting deer in the forest. For two months he did not return. When 
			he came back, he was accompanied not only by Taignoagny and his own 
			braves, but by a great number of savages, fierce and strong, whom 
			the French had never before seen. Cartier was assured that treachery 
			was brewing, and he determined to forestall it. He took care that 
			his men should keep away from the settlement of Stadacona, but he 
			sent over his servant, Charles Guyot, who had endeared himself to 
			the Indians during the winter. Guyot reported that the lodges were 
			filled with strange faces, that Donnacona had pretended to be sick 
			and would not show himself, and that he himself had been received 
			with suspicion, Taignoagny having forbidden him to enter into some 
			of the houses.<br>
			<br>
			Cartier's plan was soon made. The river was now open and all was 
			ready for departure. Rather than allow himself and his men to be 
			overwhelmed by an attack of the great concourse of warriors who 
			surrounded the settlement of Stadacona, he determined to take his 
			leave in his own way and at his own time, and to carry off with him 
			the leaders of the savages themselves. Following the custom of his 
			age, he did not wish to return without the visible signs of his 
			achievements. Donnacona had freely boasted to him of the wonders of 
			the great country far up beyond Hochelaga, of lands where gold and 
			silver existed in abundance, where the people dressed like the 
			French in woolen clothes, and of even greater wonders still,--of men 
			with no stomachs, and of a race of beings with only one leg. These 
			things were of such import, Cartier thought, that they merited 
			narration to the king of France himself. If Donnacona had actually 
			seen them, it was fitting that he should describe them in the august 
			presence of Francis I.<br>
			<br>
			The result was a plot which succeeded. The two ships, the Grande 
			Hermine and the Emerillon, lay at anchor ready to sail. Owing to the 
			diminished numbers of his company, Cartier had decided to abandon 
			the third ship. He announced a final ceremony to signalize the 
			approaching departure. On May 3, 1536, a tall cross, thirty-five 
			feet high was planted on the river bank. Beneath the cross-bar it 
			carried the arms of France, and on the upper part a scroll in 
			ancient lettering that read, 'FRANCISCUS PRIMUS DEI GRATIA FRANCORUM 
			REX REGNAT' Which means, freely translated, 'Francis I, by the grace 
			of God King of the French, is sovereign.' Donnacona, Taignoagny, 
			Domagaya and a few others, who had been invited to come on board the 
			ships, found themselves the prisoners of the French. At first rage 
			and consternation seized upon the savages, deprived by this 
			stratagem of their chief. They gathered in great numbers on the 
			bank, and their terrifying howls and war-cries resounded throughout 
			the night. But Donnacona, whether from simplicity or craft, let 
			himself be pacified with new presents and with the promise of a 
			speedy return in the year following. He showed himself on the deck 
			of the captain's ship, and his delighted followers gathered about in 
			their canoes and swore renewed friendship with the white men, whom 
			they had, in all likelihood, plotted to betray. Gifts were 
			exchanged, and the French bestowed a last shower of presents on the 
			assembled Indians. Finally, on May 6, the caravels dropped down the 
			river, and the homeward voyage began.<br>
			<br>
			The voyage passed without incident. The ships were some time in 
			descending the St Lawrence. At Isle-aux-Coudres they waited for the 
			swollen tide of the river to abate. The Indians still flocked about 
			them in canoes, talking with Donnacona and his men, but powerless to 
			effect a rescue of the chief. Contrary winds held the vessels until, 
			at last, on May 21, fair winds set in from the west that carried 
			them in an easy run to the familiar coast of Gaspe, past Brion 
			Island, through the passage between Newfoundland and the Cape Breton 
			shore, and so outward into the open Atlantic.<br>
			<br>
			'On July 6, 1536,' so ends Cartier's chronicle of this voyage, 'we 
			reached the harbor of St Malo, by the Grace of our Creator, whom we 
			pray, making an end of our navigation, to grant us His Grace, and 
			Paradise at the end. Amen.'</p>
