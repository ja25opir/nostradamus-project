<p>What’s up? Happy Fourth of July! Yesterday was a great day. I ran into Ellen from the board at the Coffee Bean in Hollywood. It was nice to put a face with the name. If our paths ever cross, please do say hello. Steve I and I went to Danny’s to finish up one of our songs. It’s called, “She Won’t Last.” It’s kind of a dark ballad with a kind of Massive Attack meets rock vibe. After that I went to the radio station where Aimee from theStart joined us for about a half an hour for some chatter and music. Matt Sorum was back from his tour and It was great to see him too. Anyway, a few answers.<br>
1. What are the cool jeans you wear in the Marshall Mode 4 advert, are they Henry Leute or something?<br>
Those were actually from Chrome Hearts, but the guy you are thinking of is named Henry Duarte.<br>
2. Even though you never graduated from high school, did you end up getting your GED???<br>
Yes, I did.<br>
3. Did you ever look up to a role model of your own?<br>
Sure I did. Hendrix, Page, Ash and my 8th grade literature teacher Ms. Dunne.<br>
4. Out of curiosity, d’you still have that coffin in your living room?<br>
No, I had to get rid of it as it didn’t go with the new curtains. (J/K) I just got tired of it. I gave it away years ago.<br>
5. As a recovering heroin addict, do you still get mental or physical cravings for it? How difficult was the withdrawal? Did you go through detox?<br>
I haven’t had a craving in years, but I can say that the detox was just horrible. I went into a facility for detox and was medicated, but even that was just the worst thing ever. If I knew way back when that it would feel that horrific, I might have reconsidered my paths of experimentation.<br>
6. So I ask who are your favorite visual artists?<br>
I love Francis Bacon. He is my number one favorite painter.<br>
7. I forgot to write: do you ever look back on photo’s from early days and cringe?<br>
Oh, of course, but I cringe with a slight hint of laughter. Hell, I even cringe when I look at present day photos.<br>
8. Have you ever considered covering a Motley song? If so, which would you like to do? Oh yeah, and which is your fave Motley album?<br>
Perk and I are all about Too Fast For Love. We always rock Live Wire when we are just screwing around in rehearsal or backstage.<br>
9. There are different reports on your actual height: anywhere from 5′6 to 5′10. Just exactly how tall are you?<br>
5′9. (When I stand up straight.)<br>
10. Why PRS guitars?? I think they are great…but everyone from creed to nickleback are using them and it seems like a trend.<br>
Maybe so, but I have been playing those since 1991, so trend or not, they remain my guitar of choice.<br>
11. By the way, just wondering…..do you like “Contraband” by Velvet Revolver?<br>
I love it for several reasons. The songs are killer and they are all close friends of mine, but even more importantly, I love what it has done for rock within the industry. It has made execs go, “Wait a minute, maybe rock isn’t dead!”<br>
12. I already own an Epiphone Les Paul, so I am at the moment on the hunt for a singlecoil guitar. Will it be worth it?<br>
You can never go wrong with a great Strat.<br>
13. Im going to hound you on that Danelectro, until one day you respond. What kind is it and what recordings, if any did it make it onto?<br>
Honestly, I don’t remember. I know I used it a lot on TNO.<br>
14. What kind of music does Carmen like? And was she ever a fan of Jane’s or the Chili Peppers before you got together?<br>
She loves all kinds but she is mostly a fan of Hip Hop. When we met, she really wasn’t well versed in either band, although she liked them both. I remember her saying that she really liked that “dog barking song.” Cute.<br>
15. hey Dave, if you weren’t a musician what do you think you’d be doing instead and why?<br>
I’d be a photographer for Maxim Magazine.<br>
Have a really great day today,<br>
Dave</p>

<p>Hey Dave,<br>
Not sure if you got my e-mail or not, but just wanted to say I appreciated the recognition on CF Radio last night.  That was really fucking cool.  Hope you all enjoyed the DVDs and CDs.<br>
BTW-to anyone looking for Camp Freddy stuff:<br>
I currently have all the videos from the “old CF site” up at N4N [notfornothing.net].</p>

<p>Dave,<br>
I listened to Camp Freddy last night. Is there really an 8 minute delay if you listen to it on the internet? if so, please do not let me “go through a tunnel” if I ever call you guys. It was great to hear GARBAGE on the radio for once. I like it when you guys talk about backstage stories. it gives us fans some good info. what unsigned band could be the “next big thing”?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Mike from NYC</p>

<p>I wish I lived in Hollywood, that’d be so awesome. You don’t run into too many people in the midwest. What are your plans for the 4th Dave? I think we’ll be watching fireworks and hoping our friends don’t blow off their hands with illegal fireworks (MN only allows sparklers &amp; fountains <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"> )<br>
My friend let me read his Maxim the other day, and before I could say anything he said “you have Cosmo, I have Maxim – do not take this away from me.” I wasn’t going to take it away from him though, I was just about to comment on an article. <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"><br>
Being a photographer would be fun, I took photography last year in high school and it was pretty sweet. Our teacher was just teaching for that year, taking a break from his own photograpy. Everyone asked him if he’d ever photographed or seen their favorite celebrities (it was actually kind of hard for the poor guy to teach <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> ) He once walked by you in a restaurant. I made him relive it several times. Good ol’ Mr. Mezaros.</p>

<p>Hi Dave<br>
I’m a fan from Newcastle, England and I’ve been looking for your book: Don’t Try This at Home for ages now and it seems nowhere in the UK stocks it.  Do you know of any US sites that I could get it from ?<br>
Thanks<br>

<p>Happy 4th of July, Dave!<br>
I only caught the last 15 minutes of the radio show last nite but those were FUN 15 minutes for sure…!<br>
Man, I love Billy Morrison´s accent… So cool! And I didn´t know that the lovely Ms. Echo had been in ONE HOT MINUTE with you… She´s probably the sexy voice in Falling into Grace, am I right? (if I am, do I get tickets for The Start´s concert?) ;O) LOL!<br>
I just read your recent answers to the questions peeps have been posting and since you have touched the subject of your “paths of experimentation” with drugs (you have such a way with words!)there are a few questions I´d like to ask you, they´ve been on my mind for quite a while… I hope you don´t mind answering them. Here they go:<br>
When you and Carmen have kids and they´re in their early teens and ready to embark on their own chemically enhanced journeys, how do you plan to approach the subject of drug use/abuse? Do you think you could benefit from your own personal experience to better enlighten them towards balance and moderation? Or will you tell them to just go teetotal? Have you ever thought about those issues or is it just too early for that?<br>
I think this is a subject that might interest a lot of your fans especially the ones who are raising their onw children right now (I´m not, but maybe some day I will – so I figured it would be interesting to know what your thoughts on the subject are).<br>
thank you for your time!<br>
Much love from,<br>
Luiz.</p>

<p>Hi Dave, I was wondering, most people remember what they’re first song they ever played on guitar was, like i think Kurt Cobain’s was Highway To Hell or Back In Black (can’t remember exactly) by AC/DC. I was wondering if you can remember yours, and if so, what it was? Mine was actually the little solo from Led Zeppelin’s No Quarter. By the way, isn’t that just such a new-sounding song? I was just listening through Houses of the Holy the other day, and i heard it again, and i thought “wow, that sounds so modern, like something from today”. Anyway, just wondering, and have a good 4th of July!<br>

<p>Hi Dave. I am so upset that I wont be able to see you play with Janes Addiction ever again. To me you are the most amazing guitarist ever. Just amazing. I have never had the chance to see you live. I do love your solo stuff, I thought it rocked.. Will you ever do anymore solo music in the future??? I really loved watching you and Carmen on your MTV show, I thought it was great and interesting to watch. I am getting married August 14th( so the show really helped <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> , yet I already feel like Im married since i live with my fiance. Anyways have a good 4th of July… Email me back if ya can…<br>

<p>Hey Dave,<br>
As a future high school English teacher/musician, I must say that I was touched by the love you gave your 8th grade literature teacher.  While it’s a rough job and we’re all grossly underpaid, it’s amazing to see how anyone, famous or not, can name a teacher who made an impact.  Just when you feel like your profession is completely underappreciated…sentiments like yours make all the difference!<br>
I’m a bit of the straight laced teach by day…wild musician by night! While I love literature and especially kids, music is my first passion and as a rock singer/songwriter (I also sing lead for a cover band, I’m a classically trained violinist and play guitar and am learning bass *whew!*) I’m working on completeing a demo and circulating my tunes.  However, I must admit that I do not live in an entertainment mecca like NYC or LA.  It’s not so much about “making it” persay…I just want to be heard, and well, my own MTV reality show would be nice <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"> .  What advice do you have for (hopefully!)up and coming musicians?<br>
Can’t wait to hear some of your new tunes, and send some love to Carmen!</p>

<p>Dave,<br>
When you answered the questions about HS and your GED it occurred to me…whoever paid for your education got their money’s worth.  I say this as a parent who begged, borrowed and applied for scholarships so that each of my kids got about a third of their education in private school.  Sooner or later this is something for you to think about also!  When I hear you talk about something you are interested in, I see your intellect.  When you are talking about something you are NOT in the least interested in or when you write, I see your education.</p>

<p>I was blasting Strays in the car today and I have to say I love that CD. To me it just seems so full of joy – especially the intro to Just Because … it’s like finding a warm place to curl up on a cold day. It really sounds like you guys were just thrilled to be playing.<br>
Is that how it felt when you were making it?<br>
If it is to be the last Jane’s album, it’s a great way to go out. <img src="http://6767.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"><br>
I like the sound of the new stuff too … a Massive Attack meets rock vibe … sounds great.<br>
I know it is really early days but I missed Janes when you played the Big Day Out in Auckland a couple of years ago… can I just put a vote in for Auckland if you take the new stuff on the road!?<br>
Thanks<br>

<p>Hugs for answering my question re the latex outfit – pity you didn’t wear it when playing the UK last year! lol!<br>
Massive Attack meets rock vibe, sounds a bit scary will those of us that are mainly rock orientated like it?<br>

<p>Hi<br>
Just want to say that the show was hilarious;)<br>
I live in Central Europe so I had to stay up all night, but it was worth it. YOU GUYS ROCK!!!<br>
One stupid question: You said you play cds from your own collections, so who the Soundgarden “LTL” belongs to?<br>
It’s one of my favorites, so I’m just curious…:)<br>

<p>Oh yeah… happy belated 4th July! Although I’m just saying that out of courtesy because it means fuck-all to me (: Actually, shouldn’t I be pissed off by July 4th, I thought it had something to do with independence from Britain or something… *shrugs* Anyway.<br>
Nice title, ‘She Won’t Last’. How d’you come up with titles for songs? I guess the easiest way is just to take a line from the song, but… par that, how do you make the names?<br>
Haha… on the way to my mum’s boyfriend’s house there’s a big chemist (uh, drug store?) called Rexall Chemists. Never fails to make me smile. (:<br>

Why have a go at Dave… hey im pretty sure Perry (for many reasons and his 67 1/2 or watever royalty rights to janes songs) hada part to play in the end of janes.<br>
If you pissed off that Dave looks better than any guys ya fucked good on him getting a good hair guy and nice clothes from photoshoots coz he wants to be photoed.. cant take the fact that hes changed… hmm have you changed in the last 10 years molly……. Just a thought</p>

Hi Dave!<br>
Are the lyrics in the new songs written from your experience? Are Steve Perkins and Chris going to post on here son cos i tried to set up an account on Perkins website but it hasnt been activated yet. Just watched Scary Movie- god i havn’t laughed so hard for ages . Carmen was brilliant in it, its so great that she doesnt take herself seriously.Happy 4th july for yesterday (although i shouldn’t say that cos im from england).<br>

<p>Hi Dave,<br>
Just wondering if Camp Freddy ever tours, or do you just play gigs in LA when you’re all there? That’s a show I’d love to see, but I don’t live in LA.<br>
I got to see you with Jane’s a couple of years back at the Rose Garden in Portland, OR, and it was amazing…especially when you came out into the crowd for the acoustic set. You were about 10 feet away from me and it was fantastic to see you play up close.</p>
