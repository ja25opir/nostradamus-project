Based on Diani beach, the EAWST was founded in 2005 in response to the increase in the whale shark population along the Kenyan coast as well as increased interest from the tourist sector. Peak season for whale shark sighting is between November and March. <br>
</p><br>
<p><br>
In the recent years there has been a significant increase in whale shark sightings along the Kenyan coast. There is a clear pattern of daily whale shark sightings emerging all year round with peak season being between the months of November to April. Whereas 10 years ago 20 whale sharks would be sighted in a year, it is now not uncommon to see 20 a day during the “whale shark” season. <br>
</p><br>
<p><br>
It is unknown at present whether the increase in whale sharks is due to the congested shipping lanes between South Africa, Madagascar and the Seychelles or due to the increase of mantis shrimp. It is clear however that there are many more whale sharks along the south coast of Kenya, in particular off Chale island and further that they are under threat from the local fishermen.<br>
</p><br>
<p><br>
Goals:<br>
</p><br>
<ul><br>
	<li>To establish a permanent database for collecting and analyzing the environmental and ecological parameters of the whale shark population size, movements and habits in the region, thus providing data to substantiate the decision making process vis-à-vis eco-tourism, fisheries, conservation and protection both locally and regionally. It is hoped that this will increase international pressure for the CITES to be reviewed in order that the whale shark be classified as an endangered species. Currently the whale shark is on Appendix II requiring only that trade be monitored.</li><br>
	<li>To set up a center in order to conduct detailed research on the whale shark through a system of satellite tagging and tracking, collecting blood specimens for genetic tracing and close observation/filming in order to add to the world-wide knowledge base on whale sharks.</li><br>
	<li>To create an awareness among local fisherman by educating them as to the value of the whale shark alive both to the marine life ecosystem and to the tourist industry including how they can benefit personally as guides, whale shark carvings etc with money being directed back into these local communities.</li><br>
	<li>To educate young Kenyans by offering local schools a fun and informative programme including showing them a whale shark documentary illustrating whale shark behaviour, feeding patterns, ages, sexual maturity etc with the aim of promoting local interest and pride in these magnificent fish that visit our waters.</li><br>
	<li>To draft a whale shark monitoring/sighting report form and to distribute this form to all local dive schools and fishing boat operators; eventually working closely with other whale shark organizations in order to get a better understanding of whale shark migration patterns, distribution, feeding habits etc.</li><br>
	<li>To provide an accredited education programme for visitors incorporating whale shark safaris affording the opportunity to swim, snorkel and dive with whale shark following approved guidelines. </li><br>
</ul>
