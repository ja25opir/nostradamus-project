    <br>
    Hey Dave,<br>
    <br>
    I've really benefited from all your techniques. I am a college freshman, and 
    i hadn't been having too many dates. I heard about your program over winter 
    break, but being away from school i didnt have the opportunity to use your 
    techniques. but, i got back a few days ago, and started meeting people on 
    the internet. i've already had one REALLY great date with a gorgeous older 
    woman. unlike before, a lot more women seem really eager to talk to me, and 
    to drive really long distance to come meet me. even the girls at college are 
    responding. two nights ago, i had a girl spend the night with me. as 
    everyone gets back to school, im sure i'll have even more success.<br>
    <br>
    my question is.......i met a lot of really cute girls over the past few 
    months. but, because i was doing things the OLD WAY, i didnt have too much 
    success with them. is there any way i can attract them now, or do i just 
    have to give up on them and start afresh?<br>
    <br>
    thanks once again.<br>
    I M<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    David D. &gt;&gt;&gt;MY COMMENTS:<br>
    <br>
    First of all, congratulations on getting out there and making things happen 
    for yourself. To address your question, I'm going to start with a little 
    home-brewed Quack Psych Analysis...<br>
    <br>
    I've noticed a pattern with guys that is VERY interesting to me: If a guy 
    meets a girl and feels attracted to her, but doesn't have success taking 
    things to a "romantic level", he will tend to think about that woman and how 
    to "try again" to get her attention, EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT 
    ALL, AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AROUND HIM.<br>
    <br>
    I think that this is probably some kind of survival mechanism gone wrong. 
    But whatever it is, it's a PAIN IN THE ASS if you ask me. In about 98% of 
    cases, it's MUCH better to just get on with your life and meet new women 
    than it is to try and go back to women you've met in the past (who, for one 
    reason or another don't feel ATTRACTION for you), and try to get them to 
    come around.<br>
    <br>
    Move on.<br>
    <br>
    You're having so much success right now.<br>
    <br>
    All you're going to do is waste time and make things difficult for you AND 
    these other women if you try to go back and get them to feel attracted to 
    you. Of course, if these women are a group of rich European models who love 
    to buy you things, let you control the remote, and have no interest in 
    cuddling after sex, then forget everything I've said, and instead devote the 
    rest of your life to changing their minds.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">***QUESTION***<br>
    <br>
    David,<br>
    <br>
    After reading a couple of your newsletters, I recognised I had a problem or 
    three! and decided to get this area of my life sorted (I was previously a 
    WUSS), purchased your e-book and then graduated to the 
	<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-130439-10791991?sid=alovelinksplus">CD series</a>. That 
    decision has turned my life around. I am tall, tanned and toned (after many 
    hours in the gym) with a great job yet had problems with attracting and 
    retaining women. This problem is now history, thanks to your materials. They 
    are certainly worth every cent (even if you are from Oz and paying 2 for 1)!<br>
    <br>
    I am not having any problems using the 3 minute routine to set up meetings. 
    Also no probs with the women feeling attraction for me. The problem is that 
    now I have been out with so many different women, I have options, I am 
    finding I now have a very specific idea of what I want, which means the vast 
    majority I tee up I do not want to see again after the first meeting, as 
    they get extremely clingy over me, are not confident or ambitious or have 
    emotional baggage etc. I have tried targeting specific places and activities 
    where these girls I would like to meet are likely to be, without lifting the 
    percentage of ones I want to meet for a second or third time.<br>
    <br>
    The question is, How can the three minute routine be adapted with similar 
    success rates to narrow the field i.e. rule out those with unattractive 
    qualities which are hard to detect in 3 minutes, prior to the first meeting? 
    I know most guys would probably love to have this problem but I am sure your 
    answer will help me and many others including the new students who will soon 
    not have enough hours in a week to meet all the women if they purchase the 
    <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-130439-10791991?sid=alovelinksplus">advanced series</a> and follow your advice.<br>
    <br>
    Keep up the great work,<br>

    <font face="Arial">&gt;&gt;&gt;MY COMMENTS:<br>
    <br>
    You know, I get emails like yours a LOT.<br>
    <br>
    Two comments:<br>
    First, it's always a good reminder when a guy like you who is physically 
    very attractive reveals to the rest of the world that there's a lot more to 
    it than being good looking.<br>
    <br>
    There's no doubt in my mind that looking good will help you meet women. But 
    there's also no doubt in my mind that it's far from everything... and, in 
    fact, most of the guys I know who are very successful with women are closer 
    to "average" than they are to "model handsome". I'm glad that you're adding 
    the "inner game" to the looks, and having success with it.<br>
    <br>
    Second, to answer your question, I'd like to point out that when a guy 
    starts experiencing a LOT of success with women, he usually begins to 
    realize a few things:<br>
    1) Just because a woman is attractive doesn't mean that she has her life 
    together, that she's emotionally stable, that she will be interesting and 
    fun to spend time with... etc.<br>
    2) The more women you meet, the more PICKY you become.<br>
    3) A fantastic woman that really has all areas of her life together is VERY 
    RARE.<br>
    4) Finding one of these rare, wonderful women often takes awhile.<br>
    <br>
    The fact is that men and women BOTH tend to put their best foot forward in 
    the beginning and only demonstrate their positive sides.<br>
    <br>
    If you REALLY want to learn how to figure out what a woman is REALLY like 
    when you first meet her, then you'll probably want to start studying 
    psychology, behavior, and communication in depth. Also, the more you 
    approach and meet women, the more you'll be able to put the puzzle together 
    faster in the beginning.<br>
    <br>
    By the way, you have one of those problems that most guys would say "Waaaaa, 
    you poor guy". So smile about it.<br>
    <br>
    ***QUESTION***<br>
    <br>
    Dear David:<br>
    <br>
    I need your advise about something. I started to bring this one girl around 
    my family who really digs me and I really started to dig also. She is by far 
    the best looking woman I have ever dated in my life a solid 9 ½ for sure. 
    Every one of my friends stand utterly amazed on how well I do with the 
    ladies. I told them I use your material. I have given your web site to about 
    8-10 people already. Out of all of the girls, I like her most. I started to 
    see her about two weeks ago and I have used a lot of the techniques on her 
    in the e-book and she likes it. I told her I have done a lot of research in 
    the area of dating and relationships after about three dates. Well thank the 
    lord I did. Some family members of mine told this girl I have been reading 
    your stuff. I did not deny it. However, they specifically said, I learned 
    how to seduce women and part of it was to be cocky/sarcastic and funny with 
    women and they like it. I stood up to the challenge and said, "I told you I 
    did a lot of reading on the subject matter and it works because it allows me 
    to see what I want from a woman and how to handle some of the bullsh** test 
    you women put us men through. She looked at me and said, Oh I can't believe 
    you and spanked me!" If I recall you said, "women actually appreciated the 
    fact you took the time out to see what turned them on and they were actually 
    grateful."<br>
    <br>
    On the way home she keep looking at me with a smile and saying what are you 
    thinking about? I said, nothing and then I said, I found someone I liked now 
    and it helped me do it. She said, "what ever works, its ok." Feel like I 
    lost some of my MO JO control in the relationship because of it. What do you 
    think? I went back to my home and started right away on things and we did it 
    again. How do I handle this girl now that the cat is completely out of the 
    bag I write into you and read your stuff! I played it as if everything was 
    normal and we still did it. She called me and said, "thank you I had a nice 
    time and I have a great family." I told her to call me tomorrow. She said, 
    "I will!" Do you anticipate any problems for me in the future? I felt a 
    little funny acting cocky and funny with her after this happened, but I 
    still busted on her a little but not as much. She laughed at what I said, 
    but looked at me like is this really you speaking. I hope they didn't screw 
    this up for me with this one. I am so pissed off. I can't believe they would 
    give me up like that. I don't think I looked any less confident about my 
    abilities to make her feel the powerful emotion attraction. Any comments on 
    the subject need a response ASAP.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks David!<br>

    &gt;&gt;&gt;MY COMMENTS:<br>
    <br>
    Your email is rather funny, man.<br>
    <br>
    So what you're telling me here is that you did everything you learned from 
    me, you met an ultra fine, wonderful woman, you told her how you learned to 
    attract women, she responded by calling you to tell you that she had a nice 
    time with you... And your problem is what?<br>
    <br>
    YOUR PROBLEM IS YOUR OWN SELF DOUBT.<br>
    <br>
    When you said to her "...I found someone I like and it helped me do it..." 
    it almost sounds like YOU'RE APOLOGIZING for it. Bad bad bad. I'm assuming 
    that you TURNED INTO A WUSS FOR A MOMENT and used the "I'm caught" voice... 
    and when she said "what ever works, its ok" she wished that she didn't have 
    to tell you that.<br>
    <br>
    Quit doubting yourself, and keep doing what works.<br>
    <br>
    ***QUESTION***<br>
    <br>
    Whats up Dave? I like the work you did in your eBook...cocky/funny and the 
    friendship frame work great. I do have one question however. You state that 
    cocky/funny humor works best when your not smiling/look serious. However, a 
    lot of guys who I know that are successful with women say that smiling is 
    the most effective thing that attracts women. What's your take on smiling?<br>

    <br>
    This is an interesting subject.<br>
    <br>
    I think that MOST guys smile too much when they're talking to women that 
    they're attracted to. Now, I have to modify what I just said a bit.<br>
    <br>
    How about this: Most guys smile IN A WAY THAT LOOKS LIKE FAKE APPROVAL 
    SEEKING WUSSY MAN when they're talking to women that they're attracted to.<br>
    <br>
    I recommend that most guys learn how to control all aspects of their body 
    language so they can quit doing things that make them needy, apologetic, 
    like they're trying to get a woman's approval, etc. And smiling is one of 
    those aspects. With that said, I know guys who smile A LOT when they're 
    meeting women, and they do VERY well.<br>
    <br>
    What's their secret?<br>
    <br>
    They know all the things to do RIGHT, so their smiling doesn't come across 
    as them trying to be liked, kissing up to a woman, etc. Do what works for 
    you. But if you've been the kind of guy that tries to get women to "like 
    you" in the past, then you'd probably benefit from learning how to smile 
    less, and be Cocky &amp; Funny MORE.<br>

    ***COMMENT FROM A WOMAN***<br>
    <br>
    Dave,<br>
    <br>
    I am a 29 year old female, and subscribed to your news letter for kicks and 
    to see what advice you were giving men. I have to say that you are pretty 
    much dead on, although I have only read the e-mail newsletters for the past 
    week or so. However, what prompted me to write was your response to A.from 
    Mpls in your "Mailbag". He asked how not to "regress to Wuss behavior". Each 
    and every one of those applies to someone I dated very briefly back in 
    November. He was guilty of ALL THREE Wuss behaviors, and I promptly stopped 
    seeing him. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to chase after some jerk. 
    But I do want someone with his own life, his own circle of friends, his own 
    hobbies and interests, etc. It's very difficult to share all that life has 
    to offer when a guy doesn't have one of his own, or gives it up just to be 
    with me. I'm looking for someone that will challenge me (and I him) so that 
    we can grow together. I don't want someone growing attached to me. Keep<br>
    up the good work.<br>

    <br>
    Read the above letter again, and see if you can "get" what this woman is 
    saying. Try to imagine what it's like to be her, and try to figure out what 
    she's REALLY trying to communicate here. If you don't get it, read it once a 
    day until you do.<br>
    <br>
    ***QUESTION***<br>
    <br>
    What's happening Dave?<br>
    <br>
    i've got a few questions.<br>
    1. You always reiterate not being a wuss, but what type of things/actions 
    should i be saying to act like a man? Should I be cussing my head off in 
    front of her and threaten with a back-handed slap like a pimp? (laughing)<br>
    <br>
    2. This might be a stupid question, but i say the only stupid question is 
    the one you don't ask. I was wondering what does it mean when you're in a 
    club/bar type of scene and a woman is driking (water or whatever) and she is 
    giving me eye contact? Is she interested in me or just teasing?<br>
    <br>
    3. Also how cocky should i be, cuz i don't wanna come across as arrogant? 
    i'm a rookie in the game (18), &amp; i've noticed that women give me signals 
    (e.g. looking), but my insecurities kick in, and before i make a move i 
    wan't to be sure that she's really intrested in me, rather than playing the 
    fool.<br>
    <br>
    eternal thanks.<br>

    Answers:<br>
    <br>
    1) To answer your question about whether to cuss your head off in front of a 
    woman and threaten with a back-handed slap like a pimp (laughing)...<br>
    NO. Don't laugh at all while you do it.<br>
    <br>
    2) In response to the "what does it mean when a woman is giving me eye 
    contact" question...<br>
    It means that she's gay.<br>
    <br>
    3) To address your question about how cocky you should be...<br>
    You should be exactly 87.234235% cocky. No more, no less.<br>
    <br>
    OK, OK, I should be more gentle with you. I sure wish that I would have been 
    asking these questions when I was 18. Maybe I just envy you, and want you to 
    have to go through the school of hard knocks like I did. OK, enough 
    self-therapy... back to the questions.<br>
    <br>
    Ways to act like a man include (but are not limited to):<br>
    1) Holding yourself upright, chest held high.<br>
    2) Acting like a LEADER, not a follower.<br>
    3) Not looking to others for approval and attention.<br>
    4) Demonstrating that you are in CONTROL of yourself and your surroundings.<br>
    <br>
    ...When a woman makes repeated eye contact with you, she's usually signaling 
    to you that she'd like you to approach her and start a conversation.<br>
    <br>
    ...The right amount of Cocky is the same amount of FUNNY. You always want to 
    make sure that what you're saying is FUNNY as well as COCKY. Guys who use 
    TOO MUCH Cocky come across as arrogant and insecure. You'll learn a lot as 
    you use this stuff. Thanks for your email!<br>

    ***QUESTION***<br>
    <br>
    David:<br>
    <br>
    Your audio series have done a lot for me, my sex life is almost great. (now 
    I only have 2 girls to sleep with) one is an "8" and the other one is a "3" 
    I know she is a monster but what the hell its great to practice.. by the way 
    I am 36 and they are 22<br>
    <br>
    Today I was with some friends at a MacDonald's talking about cars and I made 
    eye contact with a "9" , On the way out I only made a funny comment to her 
    and she responded very friendly but we left anyway. When I was in the car I 
    realize how stupid and slow I was.<br>
    <br>
    I hate long letters so here is the question:<br>
    How do I program myself to automatically say "Hi" when I see an unexpected 
    opportunity? (Specially if I am thinking about other stuff) I always think 
    in a thousand things that I should say when it's too late. I know this can 
    be done because I say "Thanks" when the opportunity appears without thinking 
    or "Bless you" when somebody sneezes.<br>
    <br>
    The girls I sleep with now where introduced to me by friends in common but I 
    still have problems picking up women in the street.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    You're cracking me up over here! Your sex life is "almost great"? And my 
    favorite quote of the day has to be "...and the other is a "3" I know she is 
    a monster but what the hell it's great to practice...".<br>
    <br>
    Whatever, dude.<br>
    lol...<br>
    <br>
    The way to get yourself to the point where you start talking to women 
    automatically is:<br>
    1) To mentally practice this stuff every day until you're DOING IT (like you 
    learned in the CD Audio Program)...<br>
    2) To keep DOING IT IN THE REAL WORLD until it's a HABIT.<br>
    <br>
    Look, you've been running around on this planet for 36 years with the habit 
    of NOT automatically saying hi. It might take a few minutes or so to program 
    yourself with the opposite. You're doing fine, just stick with it and you'll 
    start to see more and better results.<br>

    ***COMMENT FROM A WOMAN***<br>
    <br>
    Hey Dave, so you think you are the main man - the only one out there who has 
    discovered "our game?" Ha! Somehow I got on your mailing list and I can't 
    tell you how much I enjoy reading all the wuss comments. I must congratulate 
    you, senor savvy, on making a ton of money by giving away our little secret.<br>
    <br>
    I am a 41 year old happily married woman with a great husband. Let me tell 
    you, we bust on EACH OTHER to this day and it keeps us going. I hope all 
    those wusses out there keep taking your advice we women love this crap and 
    feed off it. I personally lap it up and then turn around and dish it out. 
    Why not? It sparks severe sensual interest and tension and keeps things on 
    fire! Don't get me wrong, we both do nice things for each other, but we love 
    a challenge, too. My husband goes nuts when I throw him down and give him 
    what I need.<br>
    <br>
    I have two boys &amp; a girl - the boys are being raised to love their mama, but 
    not take anything off of their girlfriends until its worth it. And my baby 
    girl? She already has my personality and cockiness and is going to be hell 
    on wheels! I love your newsletters - see, I actually get a few hints here 
    and there too!<br>

    Oh, you said something that is PRICELESS about busting on and being busted 
    on... "It sparks severe sensual interest and tension and keeps things on 
    fire!"<br>
    <br>
    THIS IS A WOMAN TALKING HERE, SO PAY ATTENTION!<br>
    <br>
    Most guys just can't at all imagine how being Cocky &amp; Funny, busting on a 
    woman, teasing her, etc. could POSSIBLY work to create ATTRACTION. Well, it 
    does. Thanks for your email.<br>
    <br>
    ***QUESTION***<br>
    <br>
    Dave, first of all, you are absolutely right about the C/F routine. 
    Excellent technique. I've even "experimented" on a friend of mine (It's a 
    female, i'm not gay). She seems be more flirty around me when i am being 
    cocky. I have been friends with her for about a year, and i'm trying to hook 
    up with her. I know that people say once the "friendship line" is crossed, 
    there's no turning back. But i'm wondering if there is anything you can help 
    me with to try to hook up with her. She's even told me she's thought about 
    hooking up with me, but said it might be weird because we are good friends. 
    I need help, i really want to get something going with this girl. Is there 
    something i should do or say to her? Would it be weird if i just kissed her? 
    Help!<br>
    <br>

    &gt;&gt;&gt;MY COMMENTS:<br>
    <br>
    Yea, I have a great idea. Keep doing what you're doing. It's not impossible 
    to make a woman that is "just friends" with you attracted to you. It's just 
    that most guys act like SUCH WUSSIES around their female friends that it 
    would be easier to turn coal into diamonds than to turn their female friends 
    into lovers. And use "The Kiss Test" (the one on the second page of my main 
    website). That will keep the kiss from being "weird".<br>
    <br>
    ***SUCCESS STORY***<br>
    <br>
    A friend got me your books as a birthday present, being that before then I 
    was pretty pathetic with the ladies, Being a wrestler made it all the more 
    of an insult. When I did get a relationship, it would never last more than a 
    week, and nothing would come out of it. Well, after reading your stuff I 
    realized how much of a wuss I was. I did almost every wuss thing in the 
    book, not to mention just having a severe lack of confidence...<br>
    <br>
    Just to see what works, I went on one of those picture rating sites. I'll 
    tell ya, of 3 pictures I ranked from 6.5 to 9.5. The 6.5 one being me as a 
    well groomed nice guy with a smile and the 9.5 as me a year later in a cast 
    with a "pissed off drug dealer" look (I'd been missing a season of 
    wrestling, it was only fitting). I realized the nice guy look wasn't 
    working. I also met about a dozen girls on that system and just practiced 
    the c&amp;f on them. I was the one calling the shots, dropping the boring ones 
    and sticking to the interesting ones, instead of them choosing whether I was 
    worthy... The funny part was, they each started telling me how infatuated 
    they were with me, and telling me about dozens of guys who piss them off, 
    where each of those guys were doing things I used to do by nature... Well, 
    after I realized that I actually did have it in me, I brought it all 
    together and started using it on girls back at college. I'm currently going 
    out with one of the most beautifulgirls in my college, and it's you I have 
    to thank for <br>
    it.<br>

    <br>
    YEA! A guy that actually did the things that I wrote in the book, and found 
    out that they work.<br>
    <br>
    NICE!<br>

    What can I say, other than "keep up the great work"? Oh, and you're welcome.<br>

    all of the "Your stuff is great" and "I don't need to tell you how well your
