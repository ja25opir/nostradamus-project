  Perceived Still at Risk with PCA Pumps</b></font></p>
<p>by Kim J. Vicente, PhD, PEng </p>
<p>I write to respond to two critiques of an article I wrote in the last APSF 
  Newsletter, warning practitioners about the patient deaths that have occurred 
  with the Abbott Lifecare 4100 PCA Plus II infusion pump.1 The APSF deserves 
  to be congratulated for publishing that article despite the fact that Abbott 
  is a Grand Patron of the APSF. This decision sends a strong and important message 
  to the anesthesiology community Ð patient safety comes first. </p>
<p>In this critique of my article, Dr. Andre mentions that he was asked to make 
  his opinions on the matter of PCA safety "at the request of Abbott Labs".2 However, 
  he does not mention that he previously served as a paid consultant to Abbott 
  Laboratories.3 </p>
<p>I agree with Dr. Andre about the value of a systems approach to design. This 
  issue has been consistently recognized in the human factors literature. For 
  example, cognitive work analysis is a systems approach to the design of information 
  support systems to help workers in complex sociotechnical domains, of which 
  medicine is one example.4 This approach represents a very broad view, incorporating 
  technical, psychological, social, and organizational dimensions in one integrated 
  and coherent framework. </p>
<p>The majority of Dr. Andre's three-page long rebuttal is devoted to explaining 
  why the purported fix I proposed is flawed. My article was limited to stating 
  that: a) several patients have died while connected to the Lifecare 4100; b) 
  these deaths were associated with programming errors; and c) reports in the 
  literature have linked these errors to human factors inadequacies in the design 
  of the current PCA interface (i.e., the initial presentation of the minimum 
  medication concentration value in one mode of operation). My intent was to bring 
  this information to the attention of the anesthesiology community so that patient 
  safety could be improved, a goal that we all share. No "quick fix" was proposed. 
  In our published research on the Lifecare 4100, my colleagues and I also did 
  notÑand in fact, could notÑpropose a solution to this specific problem.5 First, 
  we did not conduct any clinical trials of an alternative interface, and second, 
  we only learned of the deaths associated with the Lifecare 4100 after our research 
  was published. </p>
<p>I agree with Dr. Andre that any solution that is intended to reduce the number 
  of deaths due to programming errors must be examined very closely and carefully, 
  preferably following a human factors systems design approach. It is for this 
  reason that I did not propose a quick fix in my article. Nevertheless, the fact 
  that there may very well be legitimate debate about the best way to fix the 
  problem does not prevent Dr. Andre or Abbott from taking some kind of action 
  to improve patient safety. </p>
<p>I am pleased to see from Dr. McLeskey's reply to my article that Abbott is 
  intending to release a next-generation device in 2001.6 That device appears 
  to have the potential to eliminate programming errors through bar code technology. 
  However, this is not the first time that Abbott has said that it will change 
  the design of the Lifecare 4100.7 </p>
<p>In the meantime, the existing version of the Lifecare 4100 is still being used 
  on a daily basis in hospitals around the world, including nearly 4,000 hospitals 
  in the US alone.8 Because of my beliefs, I am still concerned that patients 
  continue to remain at risk for accidental drug overdoses and associated morbidity 
  and even mortality while the current-generation device is being used. </p>
<p>Dr. McLeskey is correct in stating that the number of reported deaths associated 
  with programming errors on the Lifecare 4100 is very small compared to the 22 
  million patients who have not experienced any problems. For example, the ECRI 
  and ISMP investigations I cited in my original article report three, and perhaps 
  four, deaths.9,10 However, it is well-known that incidents are vastly under-reported 
  in medicine. Studies have shown that only about 5% of the incidents that occur 
  actually get reported.11,12 "This suggests that using [incident reports] as 
  a primary data source to study drug-related complications will be misleading".11 
</p>
<p>Dr.McLeskey is also correct in stating that no technology is risk free. The 
  more important question is whether we have enough information to readily reduce 
  the number of deaths associated with the use of this device. For the reasons 
  outlined in my original article, I believe that it has been possible to introduce 
  a next generation product that "will feature numerous design and safety improvements".6 
</p>
<p>I am pleased that Abbott is currently intending to take this important step. 
  Abbott started their efforts to redesign the Lifecare 4100 in 1996.6 That was 
  the year that ISMP first issued a safety brief on the Lifecare 4100.13 Since 
  that time, ISMP has published numerous articles about how inadequate attention 
  to human factors engineering in PCA pump design can threaten patient safety.7,10,14-18 
  During this time, more patients are alleged to have died of overdoses while 
  connected to the Lifecare 4100.10,17,19 Meanwhile, Abbott has yet to issue a 
  product recall.20 Moreover, to my knowledge, Abbott has also not issued a proactive 
  letter to hospitals to warn them of the conditions under which patient deaths 
  appear to continue to occur.20 Abbott did, however, issue a letter to clinicians 
  in 1997 implying that the ECRI report of deaths associated with the Lifecare 
  4100 was inaccurate.21 That letter did not acknowledge that a device redesign 
  could improve patient safety. </p>
<p>Perhaps, in the future, medical device manufacturers or government regulators 
  will take actions so that we can collectively "recognize, anticipate, and defend 
  against new paths to failure that arise as organizations and technology change, 
  before any patient is injured".22 </p>
