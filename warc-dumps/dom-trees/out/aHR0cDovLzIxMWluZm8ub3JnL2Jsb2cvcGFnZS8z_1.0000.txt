				<div class="entry">
					<p>The Oregon Department of Human Services just released information about a drawing that will give 35,000 Oregon adults health care coverage.</p>
<p>Here are the details from their release:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Demand for the Oregon Health Plan is so high that the state is maintaining a reservation list of people who want to apply for OHP, and then drawing from that list to find people who qualify based on income. In the next month there will be drawings on May 3 and May 21. People are encouraged to sign up for the list before the drawings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong>The state has funding to add some 35,000 adult Oregonians to the Oregon Health Plan Standard thanks to legislation passed in 2009. The state estimates that some 140,000 qualify based on income. </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong>In order to ensure that all qualified Oregonians receive an equal opportunity for care, the Oregon Health Authority maintains an open reservation list and holds regular drawings. People whose names are drawn will receive an application packet that asks them questions about income and residency that determine if they are qualified for OHP. </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">To be added to the reservation list, low-income Oregonians should <strong><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/open%20or%20call%201-800-699-9075"><strong>call 1-800-699-9075</strong></a> or 711 TTY</strong><strong>, or visit the website at </strong><strong><a href="http://www.ohplist.oregon.gov/">www.ohplist.oregon.gov</a></strong>. <strong>Reservation request forms are also available at local Department of Human Services’ offices, local county health departments, and most hospitals and health care clinics. </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">While there is a reservation list for adults and income limits for the Oregon Health Plan, health officials point out that with the Oregon Healthy Kids program, all Oregon children — regardless of their parents’ income or status on the OHP list — are eligible for health care.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">“Even if parents are still on the waiting list for their health care, they can add their children today,” says Mohr Peterson. “We hope that people will sign their kids up right away.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">To sign up for the Healthy Kids Plan, call 1-877-314-5678 or visit the Healthy Kids website at <strong><a href="http://www.oregonhealthykids.gov/">www.oregonhealthykids.gov</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you work in an organization where this information might be helpful please post or send it around.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><img class="alignright" title="Call 911" src="http://ktar.net/blogs/crummey/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/911.gif" alt="" width="184" height="163">In a post this morning the Oregon Emergency Management and Disaster Preparedness blog asked the intriguing question: <a href="http://oem-oregon.blogspot.com/2010/04/do-you-remember-time-when-there-was-no.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OregonEmergencyManagementPreparednessAndDisasterBlog+%28Oregon+Emergency+Management+Preparedness+and+Disaster+Blog%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">“Do  you remember a time when there was no 911 system</a>?” And yesterday they asked: <a href="http://oem-oregon.blogspot.com/2010/04/did-you-know-you-can-dial-211-for-help.html">Did  you know you can dial 211 for help?</a> (thanks for spreading the word OEM!).</p>
<p>Two questions, in two days, that are&nbsp; relevant to 211info’s work and our community’s safety.</p>
<p><strong>What about disaster preparedness?</strong><br>
A while ago I posted about <a href="http://211info.org/blog/emergency-turn-211">using 211 in an emergency</a>, but OEM’s point is: what do you do if the phones or numbers don’t work? 911 and 211 can’t be accessed via text message (currently).</p>
<p>800-megahertz radios and satellite phones might be an option. But how many of us have those?</p>
<p>Here is OEM’s response:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">When the 911 system is interrupted, it is often during the worst  possible time so we are reminding everyone to have the phone numbers to  the police, fire, Veterinarian, and ambulance posted by your phones or  in a location known by each member of the family.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Phone service  may also be interrupted.  It is important to check your home and cell  phones by calling neighbors and establishing your own communication  system in the event of an emergency. Neighbors should maintain contact  with each other for mutual support. Being ready for the unexpected is  what emergency preparedness is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from 911</strong><br>
The other question that popped to my mind is one I hear from time to time around the office or in 211 meetings. How did 911 become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so</span> integrated in our society that we all take it for granted? And how do we move 211 to that place?</p>
<p>I think the short answer is: it wasn’t easy for 911 and it won’t be easy for us. It will take a lot of people in the community, in our state and in our nation as a whole standing up and saying: hey, we need this service. People’s lives will be better for it.</p>
<p>I have written these little equations down in the past:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">211 + community services + public knowledge = improved lives</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">911 + emergency services + public knowledge = improved lives</p>
<p>Are they simplistic? Yes. Do they drive home a point? Hopefully.</p>
<p>So I guess I’ll pose two questions for you to ponder:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1) What would YOU do in an emergency, when some of the things we all take for granted stop working?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2) How do we bring the 211 movement to the tipping point that 9-1-1 reached some time ago?</p>

<p><strong>Portland, OR – </strong>In an economic climate where every dollar spent by Oregon’s charitable foundations is scrutinized, three of the largest grant-makers –The Collins Foundation, Meyer Memorial Trust and the Oregon Community Foundation — have invested $190,000 in 2-1-1, the health and community information equivalent of 9-1-1.</p>
<p>The latest grant to 211info is from The Collins Foundation,&nbsp;an independent private foundation created in 1947 by Truman W. Collins and other family members. The foundation exists to advance humanitarian endeavors in the state of Oregon and to assist in improving the quality of life for Oregonians.&nbsp;It announced a $50,000&nbsp;grant to&nbsp;211info to be used over the next two years&nbsp;to expand 2-1-1 services statewide.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to support an endeavor that has the potential of serving the entire state,” says Cynthia Addams, Executive Vice President of The Collins Foundation. “Imagine needing help and being able to call one number from anywhere in Oregon to get a local referral to vital social services. A statewide 2-1-1 system is one of the best investments that can be made to help coordinate information in a complex social service system.”</p>
<p>The foundation community is looking to 211info to serve a broad cross-section of Oregonians, while working to make a vast system of nonprofit and public agencies more efficient. Nationwide, 2-1-1 covers more than 80% of Americans and in parts of Oregon (currently seven counties) 2-1-1 has operated and expanded since 2004.</p>
<p>2-1-1 was established because of a demand for a single, easy-to-remember number for residents to call for life-improving services and as a service that could take administrative strain off of those who normally spend hours searching for services for clients or constituents.</p>
<p>“A few things about our 2-1-1 system are unique. One is the fact that we use a single call center for the entire state. Administrative costs associated with starting a call center are greatly decreased for counties – many of whom could never afford to start one from scratch. And two – all the resources collected and utilized by our call center are gathered locally, in each county, to ensure, accuracy and relevance to the user,” explains 211info CEO Liesl Wendt.</p>
<p>Last year, 211info provided referrals more than 260,000 times through the phones and their online database. The economic crisis is driving up call volume – especially for basic needs. For instance, more than 18,000 calls from people searching for food came in last year, an increase of 66%. Internet searches have also increased more than 64% in one year.</p>
<p>211info is hoping to have a complete statewide 2-1-1 system by 2013. Lane, Marion, Polk and Jackson are among the counties expressing interested in bringing on 2-1-1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">###</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About 211info</span></strong></p>
<p>211info is a nonprofit that connects the people of Oregon and Southwest Washington to the community resources they need. Last year, people relied on 211info more than 260,000 times for referrals to food, shelter, housing and utility assistance, counseling and much more. 211info operates 2-1-1 — the free, the easy-to-remember health and community helpline, in addition to maintaining an online database with more than 4,200 resources. 2-1-1 coverage extends to seven counties in Oregon and four counties in Southwest Washington. 211info is leading Oregon’s efforts to join 28 other states that provide statewide 2-1-1 coverage.</p>

					<p><a href="http://211info.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/WinterShelter.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-203" title="WinterShelter" src="http://211info.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/WinterShelter-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>With an abusive situation left in Montana, Marjorie and Myesha came to Portland with the prospect of a new job and a new life <img src="file:///C:/Users/MKINSH%7E1/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.png" alt="">awaiting them. But in this economy, nothing is a sure bet. The position closed and the family was in a new town, in the harsh winter months of December, with no leads.</p>
<p>Their only income was TANF and SNAP. They had never been homeless before. But with a quick call they were placed in a Multnomah county winter shelter.</p>
<p>Today, Marjorie is working full-time, Myesha is in school and they have their own home to enjoy. But what happened to bring this about? What are the steps nonprofits and government can take to ensure such success stories?</p>
<p>211info is proud to be a part of a team led by <a href="http://www.humansolutions.org/" target="_blank">Human Solutions</a>. And we are proud to partner with <a href="http://www.goosehollowfamilyshelter.org/" target="_blank">Portland Homeless Family Solutions</a>, <a href="http://www.firstunitarianportland.org/" target="_blank">First Unitarian Church</a>, <a href="http://commoncupshelter.org/" target="_blank">Common Cup</a>, <a href="http://www.co.multnomah.or.us/dchs/" target="_blank">Multnomah County</a> Department of County Human Services and <a href="http://www.joinpdx.com/" target="_blank">JOIN</a>.</p>
<p>All told the team produced amazing results:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,145 nights of shelter provided</li>
<li>87 families served</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 129 adults</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 138 children</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 267 total in families</p>
<ul>
<li>85 single women or pregnant couples served</li>
<li>41 families housed, 11 more pending</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the system works</strong></p>
<p>Having one phone number for people to call is crucial. The time it would take to call the different shelters – assuming you could even find their numbers – is certainly more than anyone can spare. In our case, 211info handles the Winter Shelter line and extends our hours to meet demand.</p>
<p>When someone calls, they speak to a call center specialist who explains what the shelter is going to be like. They can answer any questions and then they place the family in the appropriate shelter. This places both call center duties and scheduling duties in the hands of one organization – saving administrative headaches.</p>
<p>Once, the person or family enters the shelter they meet with a housing specialist who will discuss options for housing, provide case management and offer other services that will help the individual and their family.</p>
<p>In Myesha’s case, she got help enrolling in school. Meanwhile, Marjorie worked with Housing and Employment Specialists who worked with her on a frequent basis to secure a new job and to find rental assistance for three month’s rent until her income could support the family.</p>
<p>This year 41 people were placed in permanent housing situations with eleven more pending. This couldn’t happen without the amazing work of those in the shelter, a coordinated effort between multiple groups and the funding provided by the county.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Emily Berndt, 211info Call Center manager and one of the project leads, sees two lessons that can be learned by anyone hoping to establish a winter shelter program:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Private and public sector partnerships are key. </strong>When government, independent nonprofits and the faith based community communicate effectively, coordinate efforts and leave ego out of it – the system serves people much more efficiently than if each group were doing their own thing.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Compassion and knowledge is crucial for inspiring action. </strong>There can be stigma associated with needing shelter or being homeless. Having one point of contact for everyone to call removes the hassle of scheduling a shelter for those who need it. But more importantly, if the person answering that initial call is knowledgeable and compassionate then the opportunity to motivate someone to seek shelter when otherwise they may be too ashamed is invaluable. Then, when that compassion and knowledge is embodied by those in the shelters, a family has a strong chance of moving to a much more stable environment.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you had experience sheltering the homeless in winter months or otherwise? What are your experiences and lessons learned?</strong></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>By Jenny Dodd, 211info Volunteer Coordinator</em></p>
<p>In honor of National Volunteer Week I wanted to share a little bit about what I have learned as 211info’s Volunteer Coordinator. We started our Volunteer Program in July 2009 in response to increased community demand for 211info’s services. Since then, 26 volunteers have joined 211info to help answer calls, update the resource database, and provide administrative support. Volunteers have dramatically increased capacity and improved service delivery, and have become a vital part of 211info’s work in the community.</p>
<p>Here are 8 quick lessons I’ve learned along the way about starting a volunteer program…</p>
<ul>
<li>Be flexible</li>
<li>Recognize and thank volunteers</li>
<li>Invest in organizational staffing to manage a volunteer program—it’s a big job!</li>
<li>Recognize that training is an initial and ongoing process</li>
<li>Consider the role of staff in integrating volunteers into the agency</li>
<li>Foster relationships with the many amazing volunteer-matching, work experience, and school-based programs in the community</li>
<li>Be accessible, your volunteers need to have one person to turn to for anything!</li>
<li>Tap into the experiences of local volunteer experts – such as Hands on Greater Portland, NOVAA and other volunteer support organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>211info’s Volunteer Program would not be possible without invaluable partnerships with<a href="http://www.handsonportland.org/HomePage/index.php/home.html" target="_blank"> Hands on Greater Portland</a>, Seniors Make Sense, <a href="http://dwp.bigplanet.com/steps2success" target="_blank">Mount Hood Community College Steps to Success</a>, Portland State University’s Social Work program, <a href="http://www.ssw.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">Portland State University’s Public Health program</a>, <a href="http://www.mhcc.edu/docs/MentalHealth/MHHS_Brochure.pdf" target="_blank">Mount Hood Community College Mental Health and Human Services</a> program, and the <a href="http://www.up.edu/moreaucenter/default.aspx?cid=8525&amp;pid=3644" target="_blank">University of Portland’s Moreau Center work study program</a>.

<div id="attachment_190" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 146px"><a href="http://211info.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Mark_web_ready.jpg"><img class="size-medium  wp-image-190" title="Elders in Action Mark Noonan" src="http://211info.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Mark_web_ready-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="191"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mark Noonan</p></div>
<p><em>Mark Noonan is the Volunteer Engagement&nbsp; &amp; Social Media Manager at Elders in Action, a nonprofit whose mission is to make sure the quality of life should never depend on age.</em></p>
<p>Our community just works better when organizations with similar purposes partner together.</p>
<p>Last Monday, I was training one of our Personal Advocates on being an intake volunteer for Elders in Action.&nbsp; During the training I picked up the <strong>2009-2010 211info<em> </em>Community Resource Directory </strong>and made the statement that it was the bible for information and referral resources in our area. It made me stop and think about the importance of the collaboration between 211info and Elders in Action.</p>
<p>Elders in Action helps older adults in the Portland metro area who are struggling with issues surrounding housing, healthcare, or criminal activities such as elder fraud or abuse.&nbsp; In FY 2008-2009, our Personal Advocates assisted 3,561 individuals and many of these individuals just needed a resource or referral to one of the great agencies providing services to the aging community – often times they’d turn to 211info.</p>
<p>Elder in Action’s Personal Advocates receive training so they know how to utilize resources such as 211info, but their biggest assets are their abilities to draw on their own knowledge and experience while keeping an empathetic and objective perspective.&nbsp; The unique services that Elders in Action provides to the community are needed more than ever.</p>
<p><a href="http://211info.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EIA-CMYK-Hi-Res.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-191" title="EIA CMYK Hi Res" src="http://211info.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EIA-CMYK-Hi-Res-300x114.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="114"></a>Last year we served 74% more people than the previous year.&nbsp; In the past nine months our 52 Personal Advocates have logged over 2,484 volunteer hours&nbsp;and recouped over $284,000 in cost recovery or avoidance.</p>
<p>For the more complex problems, Elders in Action brings in our Personal Advocates who provide free personalized problem solving assistance and support to individuals 60 years or older living independently in Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties.&nbsp; These trained volunteers work collaboratively to provide the spark that helps an older adult overcome an obstacle and find a solution that keeps them living independently.</p>
<p>10,000 people a day are turning 60 and we at Elders in Action look for innovative ways to capture the talent and wisdom of older adults who are looking for active and meaningful ways to make a difference in their community.</p>
<p>Our 150 volunteers provide programs and services, not available anywhere else in Oregon, to thousands of residents in Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington Counties.&nbsp; We would like to invite you to meet our talented and dedicated staff and volunteers to find out the multiple ways you can get involved.</p>
<p>To learn more about our fine programs, volunteers and events, visit &nbsp;our website <a href="http://www.eldersinaction.org" target="_blank"><strong>www.eldersinaction.org</strong></a> or on Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/EldersinAction">www.facebook.com/EldersinAction</a></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Regardless if we are providing a referral to a local agency or hours of focused attention by one of our Personal Advocates, we are all thankful to have the support from 211info and other local agencies to help us navigate the maze of health and community service offerings which can often overwhelm an older adult.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">###</p>
<p>Another great way to get to know Elders in Action is to attend their Annual Open House on April 20, 2010 from 2-4pm. 1411 SW Morrison Ave., Suite 290, Portland, OR&nbsp; 97205.&nbsp; Join EiA friends, partners, and volunteers for an afternoon of good cheer and conversation.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://211info.org/blog/sixtyseven-percent-oregonians-returned-census-mailing" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Sixty-seven percent of Oregonians have returned census mailing">Sixty-seven percent of Oregonians have returned census mailing</a></h2>

				<div class="entry">
					<p style="text-align: left;">Our friends at the US Census Bureau have asked for our help to spread the word about mailing back census forms. 211info is encouraging people on the phones to do this, but we all need to work together. The bottom line (literally) is&nbsp; summed up in a US Census Bureau press release:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">As of Friday, April 9, the national mail back participation rate was 65 percent.&nbsp;Oregon was slightly&nbsp;ahead the national average with 67 percent. The&nbsp;counties with the highest participation rates were&nbsp;Benton (71%),&nbsp;Polk (70%)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Linn (70%)&nbsp;counties.&nbsp; Lagging behind were&nbsp;Gilliam County, with&nbsp;51 percent, and&nbsp;Sherman County, with&nbsp;54 percent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Census Bureau saves about $85 million in operational costs for every percentage point increase in the nation’s mail-participation rate. It costs the government just the price of a postage stamp when a household mails back the form. However, it costs the Census Bureau $57 to follow up with a non-responsive household.</p>
<p>When I got the form at home, I filled it out immediately and mailed it. All told, it probably took less than five minutes. Now I know we are all busy, but if you don’t have a couple minutes to spare in order to save 57 dollars then you might have to re-evaluate your schedule.</p>
<p>All joking aside, this is important for Oregon. The Census Bureau has created tools to help communities track their census participation. The Take 10 Challenge Map shows the latest participation rates, giving users the option to download and embed a local rate tracker “widget” on their own website.</p>
<p>If you did not receive a Census form or have misplaced it, visit: <a href="http://2010.census.gov/2010census/take10map/" target="_blank">http://2010.census.gov/2010census/take10map/ </a>to find a “Be Counted” or questionnaire assistance center site in your neighborhood, where forms are available. Both the questionnaire assistance centers and the “Be Counted” sites are operational until April 19 and can be found in public areas, such as libraries and community centers donated by businesses and organizations.</p>
<p>Or, call the Telephone Questionnaire Assistance Center hotlines for assistance seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. local time.&nbsp;The phone numbers are: English: 1-866-872-6868, Spanish: 1-866-928-2010, Chinese: 1-866-935-2010, Korean: 1-866-955-2010, Russian: 1-866-965-2010, Vietnamese: 1-866-945-2010, TDD (hearing impaired): 1-866-783-2010.</p>

<p>Sitting in the commissioners board room watching six well deserving individuals be recognized as <a href="http://www.mchealth.org/phh/index.shtml" target="_blank">Multnomah County Public Health Heroes</a> made me appreciate living in Oregon and working for an organization recognized (as our nifty certificate said) for our “outstanding dedication and service to Public Health.” The organizations and individuals who were recognized as Public Health  Heroes were very deserving. Although 211info didn’t win the award,&nbsp; we couldn’t possibly feel bad about not winning considering our company in the Community Based Organization or Program category.&nbsp; So hats off to these Public Health Heroes:</p>
