      <br>
      I'm Now 23 Years old and am married with a beautiful 3 1/2 year old girl.
      She<br>
      is our gift from god. I am hoping that my story will help women realize
      that<br>
      the pain of abortion never goes away and maybe my story will help a woman<br>
      decide not to have an abortion. Here's my story, The whole story!!<br>
      When I was 13 I became sexually active, I was looking for a guy who would<br>
      love me. I thought that if I had sex with a guy he would like me. But<br>
      I was wrong. When I was 14 my family moved 40 to 50 miles away. I was<br>
      sleeping around and I met this guy who was gorgeous and that night we had<br>
      sex. Come to find out he was married with 2 kids. I babysat for him so I
      was<br>
      over there allot staying the night. We had sex when his wife was gone. When
      I<br>
      was 15 I met my now husband. (The 13 of September is 8 years since we
      started<br>
      going<br>
      out, we recently finally got married.) In the 1st month of our
      relationship I<br>
      went over to baby-sit and ended up having sex with the married man<br>
      again. That was in Oct.92 My husband found out and so did the wife. Then<br>
      on NOV. 18 1992 I Found out I was pregnant. I wanted more than anything to<br>
      have this baby, I was so excited, I know I was only 15 but I wanted this<br>
      baby. Then the married man and his friends were calling me up pressuring
      me<br>
      to have an abortion And so was my now husband and his friends.<br>
      My now husband had gotten his ex girlfriend pregnant when they were<br>
      together) And 7 days before I<br>
      found out I was pregnant his son was born. It was Dec. 4th 1992 that I had<br>
      my abortion I was 8 weeks pregnant. My now mother in law took me to the<br>
      clinic.<br>
      When they called my name I was terrified, I went in a room with 9 other<br>
      women. A lady explained what would happen but she made it sound like it
      was<br>
      no big deal. I was so close to crying, but when I got into the
      "ROOM" the<br>
      doctor started lecturing me and that did it. I was bawling my eyes out. I<br>
      still cant believe how the doctor talked to me. They gave me a shot of<br>
      volume and demeral but it didn't work, I still felt the pain it hurt so
      bad<br>
      I cried the whole time. It felt like he was ripping my ovaries out, and
      the<br>
      noise of the machine was awful, The nurse held my hand and when it was
      over<br>
      my mother in law came in and helped me get dressed. I went to the recovery<br>
      room for about 15 minutes and then we left. From that day on I never felt<br>
      the same. My due date was on July 18 1993 and I will never forget what I<br>
      did. I cried allot and didn't know how much more of this pain I could
      take. I<br>
      would look at babies that were the same age as my baby would have been and<br>
      tears would feel my eyes. I was an emotional wreck. I cannot explain the
      pain<br>
      I feel it hurts so much, I hate myself for taking my babies life away<br>
      because I was not strong enough to stand up for myself and for my baby. I
      was<br>
      17 when I thought I couldn't take it anymore and I got pregnant!! I was so<br>
      excited and so was my husband. But at my 3 month checkup the doctor couldn't<br>
      find the heartbeat So he sent me in a room so a lady could give me an<br>
      ultrasound I was so scared.<br>
      She wouldn't let me see the screen and then she left the room . She came
      back<br>
      in and said she needed to do a vaginal ultrasound, because she couldn't
      see<br>
      anything. I was crying and didn't know what to think. She left the room
      and<br>
      the doctor came in. I lost it, He said he had bad news for me I knew then<br>
      that I had lost the baby. I was so hysterical that I left out the back way<br>
      so I wouldn't cause a distraction. On the way home I'm surprised that I didn't<br>
      get in an accident. I told my husband and he comforted me, He was upset
      too<br>
      but didn't show it. I thought that this was a punishment from god I still<br>
      don't know. The next year was really hard. But on May 1ST 1996 I found out
      I<br>
      was pregnant again. I was 18 and we were so happy. I was finally going to<br>
      have a baby. But again when I was 3 months along the doctor WHO IS NOT THE<br>
      SAME DOCTOR AS BEFORE.) couldn't find the heartbeat and I started crying<br>
      telling him this happened before. He said were going to do an ultrasound.
      I<br>
      was so scared the memories of the last time were happening all over again.<br>
      But I was wrong because on the screen was our little baby, with her hand
      up it<br>
      truly looked like she was saying mom its ok I'm here and your not going to<br>
      loose me. I have that picture and I cherish it and her. It brings me to<br>
      tears telling this story. On Dec.15 1996 our daughter was born. 3 weeks
      early<br>
      but healthy. I am so happy to have her. I will never fully get over what I<br>
      did and never forget what I did. Having my daughter has helped with the
      pain<br>
      but what I did will never be forgotten and I will never forget the baby
      that<br>
      I so stupidly aborted. my baby deserved a chance at life. I was to selfish<br>
      and not strong enough. I just hope that my baby will forgive me for what I<br>
      did. I will always have a missing piece from my heart. If your considering<br>
      abortion PLEASE<br>
      RECONSIDER. The pain never goes away. Thank you for your time.</font>

      A lot of anger from the pro-choice side I see because of the TRUTH that is
      being put out. Typical.&nbsp; Many of these people who advocate this<br>
      monstrosity are full of hate and self condemnation with suicidal<br>
      intentions. Yet, they are the same people who want to save tree rats<br>
      from extinction. Don't get me wrong I love animals, but years ago I<br>
      realized something was wrong when I felt sorry for baby seals but not<br>
      for baby humans.&nbsp; I was once the biggest pro-choice advocate, full of
      hate and rebellion but thank God, my heart changed with the blessing of a
      little one.&nbsp; Pro Death change your hearts. Human life is precious and
      who is giving these little ones the CHOICE TO LIVE??<br>
      And Hell is an eternity to regret such hateful intentions.<br>

      across your page.&nbsp; I have<br>
      always known about abortion, but I never really thought about it.&nbsp;
      Besides,<br>
      I always said "What can one person do?"&nbsp; I saw the pictures
      and my stomach<br>
      heaved as the tears flooded from under my eye lids.&nbsp; I got to my
      knees and<br>
      prayed for those children.&nbsp; I prayed for the mothers and fathers.&nbsp;
      I prayed<br>
      for the doctors and nurses.&nbsp; I prayed for the politicians and
      lawmakers.&nbsp; I<br>
      prayed for the pro life advocates.&nbsp; And then I prayed for myself, I
      prayed<br>
      the Father give me the strength to engage in this awful battle.&nbsp; I
      commend<br>
      you for informing people such as myself as to how horrific abortion is.<br>
      <br>
      When I was pregnant with my daughter, there was a lot of complications.&nbsp;
      I<br>
      remember I was in the emergency room one night and looking over to see my<br>
      fiance' praying with his eyes shut.&nbsp; I told him not to worry that I
      would be<br>
      ok.&nbsp; He looked at me very concerned and said "I do not want to
      have to<br>
      choose.&nbsp; I know that I would ask that they save you."&nbsp; I
      immediately called<br>
      my doctor in the room and explained to my fiancï¿½ and the doctor that what<br>
      ever God has planned, is his choice.&nbsp; The choice belonged to no one
      else.&nbsp; I<br>
      was informed once again of the dangers and that my body was already trying<br>
      to "self abort" the child.&nbsp; I was told over and over I
      would never leave<br>
      pregnant and if I did, the chances were not good after that.&nbsp; I
      carried my<br>
      healthy baby past term and even then she DID NOT want to come out.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I am very interested in any way that I can help.&nbsp; However, I am
      extremely<br>
      interested in informing the youth.&nbsp; Is it possible to be
      "trained" in<br>
      knowledge of abortion to speak at schools?&nbsp; Can you show the pictures
      to<br>
      high school students?&nbsp; If we can let this generation know how truly
      horrible<br>
      and damaging abortion is, a difference can be made.&nbsp; I want to know
      all that<br>
      I can to help stop this madness and murder!&nbsp;<br>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In response to Michaela's post. Concerning
      your stats on rape...those are the women who report the rape. What about
      those who don't? What are your stats on that? 1%? Someone told me that
      gays and lesbians only make up 1% of our population...I see many gays and
      lesbians so I wonder how accurate stats really are. And if it is correct
      1% can be many women.<br>
      If a woman is raped she should have the choice to have the child.
      Emergency contraception should be more readily available so women can
      simply acquire a strong dose of birth control pills without having to deal
      with any of the stress of deciding between an abortion or pregnancy. Nine
      months can be a long time...and what about the husband or boyfriend? How
      does he feel looking at the woman pregnant with another man's baby? These
      are all factors and if a woman decides that she would like have the baby
      then she should. If she does not then she should have the choice.<br>
      <br>
      "By aborting the baby you are NOT doing<br>
      what's best for the baby, you would only be thinking about yourself...what
      a terrible quality to have as a mother."<br>
      <br>
      Concerning the above quote...in this case she should be thinking about
      herself...and after being raped I should hope she would be thinking about
      herself. A terrible quality to have in a mother? She did not choose to be
      a mother remember? So instead of supporting her recovery you chastize her
      by telling her she is a bad mother?<br>
      <br>
      And again in the situation of being told that it would be in your best
      interest to terminate your pregnancy, would you listen to the doctor who
      has knowledge of this kind of situation or would you leave it to the
      higher power? Would you take the chance of leaving your family without
      you?<br>
      <br>
      Selective reduction. Another possability. Women who cannot have children
      are having science help them. Should they be forced to have eight children
      if it happens that way? Isn't that abortion too? Those are the ones not
      reported in the stats you see on the internet.<br>
      <br>
      You may feel the abortion debate is cut and dry..you simply have the baby,
      in any situation. There are many people out there who do not feel this
      way. No one forces anyone to have an abortion...but you feel you should
      force women to have the baby.<br>
      <br>
      Again, that's your opinion and that's fine. But this is mine</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Crist---@aol.com</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
      </font></p></font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You keep making this an issue of the womans...but you aren't taking
      into<br>

      those<br>
      rights end when the rights of another begins! Meaning, her right to family<br>
      planning ends when she imposes on the baby's right to live!<br>
      <br>
      Believe me, I can sympathize with a woman having an unplanned<br>
      pregnancy...I've been there three times, myself! But I would never punish
      my<br>
      baby for what his father did...<br>
      <br>
      My second pregnancy...I was a 19 year old divorced mother of a 9 month old<br>
      working at Subway Sandwiches. I was dating a 24 year old man...he beat me<br>
      almost every day! We broke up and I found out that I was pregnant. That
      was<br>
      the last thing in the world that I wanted to be...how could I have the
      baby<br>
      of a man who was so violent and hateful??? But how could I kill something<br>
      that was a part of me? I chose adoption...I miscarried almost six months<br>
      later. God (Buddah, Goddess, you fill in the blank) has a way of fixing<br>
      things...we shouldn't interfere. It's not our place to decide who should
      live<br>
      and who should die!<br>

        CLEAN, NICE, SIMPLE PROCESS THAT IS OVER IN 15 MINUTES. It is a life
        long thing that puts a HUGE impact not only on the woman that got the
        abortion but her friends, family and future lovers that are around her
        and care about her. I think that you need to wake up and stop blaming
        this site. And about your comment "what if a girl that has had an
        abortion saw this" well maybe that is a good thing, it would stop
        her from doing it again and maybe bring her to the Lord who can help her
        forgive herself for falling for the WORST lie of all that there is
        nothing wrong with abortion. I hope for your sake you wake up soon.</font><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff"></font></p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff">

      <p>Your site is RIDICULOUS. ever notice the people against abortion are
      always major religious freaks who couldn't get laid in a morgue????? a
      person has to be incredibly STUPID to think those pictures are real,
      medical clinics are regulated by law to put toxic matierials SUCH AS AN
      ABORTED FETUS in an environmentally sound biohazard container. but I
      wouldn't expect a bunch of ignorant hicks to know that. who taught you
      losers HTML anyway? yap yap yap. get a freakin' job.</p>

      </p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">As someone who has worked
      for an OB/GYN I can verify that these pictires<br>
      depict the reality of an abortion. I not only know this because of the job
      I<br>
      had but also in doing research on abortion when I was pro-choice
      myself....I<br>
      was trying to persuade an audience that abortion should be kept legal. i
      went<br>
      to many abortion clinics and saw FIRST HAND the gruesomeness found on this<br>
      site.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, the pics are DISGUSTING! But they are real! If you don't think that
      they<br>
      are genuine then what do you suppose they are pictures of? They sure look<br>
      like dead babies in garbage cans to me...and FYI, aborted fetuses are not
      put<br>
      in bio-hazard containers...after the doc performs the abortion he sends
      the<br>
      dead baby to the lab. There they make sure that they have all the peices
      and<br>
      then sell the parts to different medical companies for study...bed sheets
      and<br>
      needles are put in biohazard containers...not the dead! If you lost an ar,<br>
      they wouldn't throw it away, would they? No...you need to educate yourself
      on<br>
      a topic before making yourself look like an a$$ out of stupidity!<br>

      "arguments" against prolifers<br>
      aren't valid. You are attacking the person rather the<br>
      topic, so it's quite easy to dismiss your rant as the<br>
      ravings of a prochoice "lunatic." Secondly, your are<br>
      quite mistaken in the assumption that all prolifers<br>
      are "major religious freaks." Contrary, we come in all<br>
      flavors; gay and lesbian, athiest, agnostic, Wiccan,<br>
      Islamic, white, black, Asian, etc., as well as<br>
      political, economic diversity. Don't categorize and<br>
      stereotype people. It causes you to look as ignorant<br>
      as you assume we are.<br>
      Also, there have been numerous, well-publicized cases<br>
      of aborted babies found in public dumpsters,<br>
      land-fills, and even on a roadside. In one case, a<br>
      California abortionist had stored as many as 500 in<br>
      his garage. These news items weren't published by some<br>
      church group, but in such well-respected papers as the<br>
      LA Times and the Miami Herald. Not all abortion<br>
      clinics are regulated by law, and none are required to<br>
      report casualties or accidents to the CDC. Please<br>
      check information before posting such nonsense. Many<br>
      prolifers, contrary to your mythical ideology, are<br>
      intelligent, well-educated, well-read individuals who<br>
      have families and children. Further, my husband and I<br>
      are both prolifer, both college educated, and earn<br>
      well-over 200K a year. We aren't "ignorant hicks", and<br>
      neither are our prolifer, college-educated friends.<br>
      Maybe you should consider that truly ignorant people<br>
      make sweeping generalizations and stereotypes about<br>
      entire groups of people without bothering to first<br>
      learn what they are talking about. Perhaps you should<br>
      get a life.<br>

        RIGHT ON!!!! I never cared about people having abortions until my wife

        boy we'll have in November. Anyway you shouldnt listen to family or
        friends that try to get you to abort your child. They would'nt have
        wanted their parents to have aborted them. Alot of times its the parents
        that want the abortion&nbsp;to protect the "family name" like
        they'll have a real good name if people knew what they've done. As for
        the doctors who do this and sleep at night I dont see how. Anyway I
        think that young couples such as me and my wife should not be pressured
        into abortions, you've simply got to tell your friends and family NO
        WAY. In my personal opinion I see things eye for an eye so if you see an
        abortion doctor with only one arm or leg WELL........HE ASKED FOR IT.</font>

      <p><font size="2">Dear Abortion Tv,<br>
      <br>
      I have been reading the letters on your site for about two weeks now and
      finally decided to write myself. I am pro-choice and you can call me all
      the names you want but I have tried to rational on items but simply
      cannot. I have never had an abortion nor have I ever even come close to
      thinking about having one. But I do know that if I was raped and became
      pregnant I would have an abortion. I have been on so many pro-life sites
      and it is always brought up that women choose to take the chance when they
      have sex, and in<br>
      this case they have that choice taken away from them. I have no children
      and cannot imagine of having my first and knowing it was conceived in an
      act of hate and not an act of love. I also know that if I was diagnosed
      with cancer or another disease and advised by medical professionals that
      it would be in my best interest to terminate my pregnany I would. You
      could put your faith<br>
      in a higher power but in my opinion you can save your own life and try and
      have anothe!r child, or you can take the chance, but your loved ones can't
      try and have another you. You mention adoption and I wonder if you would
      feel that a single man or woman should adopt. Or a gay or lesbian couple?
      What I have stated in this letter is the way I feel and like I said I have
      tried to think outside the box but I cannot imagine my choice being taken
      away from me. My boyfriend is pro-life and we have discussed each of these
      matters and have agreed to what I mentioned above. I am not a fan of your
      site but you have the right to post your opinion, and I have the right to
      disagree.<br>

      </p></font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I wanted to take issue on
      some of the points that Crist76 brought up in her<br>
      recent post.<br>
      <br>
      Quote from Crist76 "But I do know that if I was raped and became<br>
      pregnant I would have an abortion. I have been on so many pro-life sites
      and<br>
      it is always brought up that women choose to take the chance when they

      <br>
      Crist, you are right. Women that have been raped do have the choice taken<br>
      away from them. I can sympathize with a woman that has been raped. I can<br>
      sympathize with not wanting to carry around a monsters child BUT what you<br>
      fail to acknowledge is that the baby would be yours too! Why should the
      baby<br>
      have to suffer for what his father did? If I robbed a bank, should my<br>
      children go to jail for it? Of course not.<br>
      Adoption is the best option in this case...do you really think the couple<br>
      that adopts the baby will care that he was conceived through rape? And<br>
      through adoption, you will live with the satisfaction of knowing that you
      did<br>
      what a mom should naturally do...whatever is in the best interest of your<br>
      child, and that can never be murder. By aborting the baby you are NOT
      doing<br>
      what's best for the baby, you would only be thinking about yourself...what
      a<br>
      terrible quality to have as a mother.<br>
      <br>
      Quote by Crist76 "I have no children and cannot imagine of having my<br>
      first and knowing it was conceived in an act of hate and not an act of
      love."<br>
      <br>
      In rape cases (which by the way only account for a handful, 1% or so, of<br>
      abortions performed) you aren't able to control the way the baby is
      conceived<br>
      BUT you are able to control the love you will show the child, your baby,
      by<br>
      giving him life!<br>
      <br>
      Quote by Crist76 "I also know that if I was diagnosed with cancer or<br>
      another disease and advised by medical professionals that it would be in
      my<br>
      best interest to terminate my pregnany I would. "<br>
      <br>
      This is so rare that it is almost a non-issue in the abortion debate. Most<br>
      women with cancer, etc are able to successfully complete a pregnancy
      without<br>
      complication.<br>
      <br>
      Quote by Crist76 "You mention adoption and I wonder if you would feel<br>
      that a single man or woman should adopt. Or a gay or lesbian couple?"<br>
      <br>
      Sure, why not...anything that will save the life of that baby is OK with
      me.<br>
      If that means that those people adopt them, then I am all for it. It isn't<br>
      ideal but it is better than death!<br>
