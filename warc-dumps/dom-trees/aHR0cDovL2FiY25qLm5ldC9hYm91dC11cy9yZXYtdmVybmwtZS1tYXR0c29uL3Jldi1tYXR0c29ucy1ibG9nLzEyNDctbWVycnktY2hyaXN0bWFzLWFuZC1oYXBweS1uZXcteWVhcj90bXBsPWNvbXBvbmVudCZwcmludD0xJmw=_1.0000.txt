</div><p>Corrine and I want to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. This is a special time of year for us. It is filled with many memories of joy and family. We pray that you are being blessed with many wonderful times of celebration and remembrances of what God has done for us. The gift of Christ has made all of the difference in our world and it keeps on giving 365 days a year on down through the centuries. If you have Christ, then anything else is just added joy in this Holy and blessed time of year.</p>
<p>On Christmas eve, my mother tells the family story of her going to church to celebrate Christmas eve with all of the neighbors and friends.&nbsp; She was&nbsp;nine&nbsp;years old and the year was 1929.&nbsp;It was a wonderful service and everyone was returning home with anticipation of what had been placed under their Christmas tree. The cold crisp air made the ride in the horse drawn sleigh, one they would remember for a lifetime. The sky was filled with stars that helped guide them down the snow covered fields, through the cattle gates, past the barn and the cattle that ate quietly at their mangers down by the hay barn. The several miles from the open country church provided time to sing through many a Christmas carol and their songs could be heard by others who made their way home across the prairie of Nebraska.</p>
<p>The kids all made their way into the dinning room adjacent to the living room where the small Christmas tree had been decorated with candles awaiting to be lit just once on Christmas eve. All the kids were excited but everyone stopped when they saw on the dinning table the family pages which once were in the front of the Family Bible. These few pages contained the birth records of the entire family and had been kept for several generations in that big Family Bible. Who would have tore these pages from the Bible? What was going on? Where was the Bible now?</p>
<p>They froze in place, everyone realized something strange had happened. They quickly learned the truth... for the floor under the tree was bare, the gifts were all gone, all of the gifts had been stolen, even the Bible which once contained the family pages which now rested on the kitchen table. While they were gone to Christmas eve services, thieves had broken in and stole their Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>All they had that Christmas was the gift of family, the gift home, and the most important, the gift from God which no one could take away in the dark of night.</p>
<p>That night, the candles on the tree burned slowly, brightly, and continue to shine with a story of God's love in the midst of this years Christmas... because God's gift shines for ever.</p>
<p>I will always remember this story, told around the Christmas celebrations of home and family. It remains a central part of Christmas... Maybe someday those who took the Bible from that country home in the sand hills of Nebraska will open it and discover God's gift to them. It is the only gift that really matters.</p>
<p>We extend to you all our prayers for a blessed Christmas celebration and a wonderful New Year.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Years!</p>
<p>Corrine and Vernl Mattson</p>
