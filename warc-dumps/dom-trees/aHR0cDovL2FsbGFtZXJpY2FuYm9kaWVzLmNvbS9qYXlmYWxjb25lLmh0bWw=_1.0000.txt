                        <br>Jay Falcone is a 34 year old upcoming bodybuilder from Connecticut.  Jay is 
                        5'10" tall and weights between 170 to 185 lbs.  His first bodybuilding show was 
                        the 2009 Mid America Pro Am in which he took 2nd Place.  In just his second 
                        show, the 2009 INBF Naturalmania Nationals, Jay achieved great success when he 
                        placed 1st in the Novice Middleweight Class.  Jay has been an active athlete.  
                        In high school, Jay ran track and field, and as a football player was 
                        instrumental in his team's winning the state championships.  In college, Jay 
                        did track and field as a Decathlete, including many events such as javelin, 
                        pole vault, long jump and 100 yard dash, and winning several medals at ODAC 
                        Conference and New England Championships.  Jay also played football in college 
                        as an outside linebacker.  He started weight training in 2007, and his training 
                        escalated from a couple of days a week to 4-5 days a week within a year.  His 
                        brother Mike got him going and provided Jay with information, spreadsheets and 
                        ideas to keep him focused on strengthening every aspect of his body.  Before 
                        long, Jay was writing his own workouts.  He is interested in also exploring 
                        opportunities in the field of fitness modeling.  Jay may look familiar to you, 
                        but that's only because his brother Mike is his twin brother, and Mike Falcone 
                        is already a model you may have seen on NorthAmericanBodies.com!   NAB is proud 
                        to now boast both of the Falcone twins as models on the site.  We are very 
                        pleased to add Jay Falcone to our roster of top bodybuilders and fitness models 
                        at NorthAmericanBodies.com, as Jay and Mike Falcone become yet another pair of 
                        siblings on the site!<br>
