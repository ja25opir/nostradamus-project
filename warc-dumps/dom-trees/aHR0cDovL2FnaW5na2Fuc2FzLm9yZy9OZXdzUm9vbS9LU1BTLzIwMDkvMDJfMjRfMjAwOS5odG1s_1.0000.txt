    <h3><strong>Click! All (or almost all) about digital</strong></h3>
    <p><em>By Dave Brown</em></p>
    <p>Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>You  have no doubt heard all the flap about television “going digital.” All the  channels will be changed so that they only handle digital transmission, as  opposed to analog. What does that mean?<br>
    </p>
    <p>Whole  industries have grown up using digital transmission. Digital is the realm of  your computer, your mobile phone, your music, your camera, and even hearing  aids. The number of ways to use digital technology appears to be endless.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When  my daughter was in grade school about 40 years ago, she was taught the “new  math.” Why? Because it was the kind of math that educational experts thought  would be needed in the future — which has turned out to be true.&nbsp; Here were fourth- and fifth-graders, learning  to add and subtract in a numerical system using the base two (also known as  binary) instead of the more comfortable base 10 we were all using.<br>
    </p>
    <p>So  how did this all get started? Using symbols to represent words, letters and  numbers is not new. The abacus was created between 1,000 BC and 500 BC. This  basic digital calculator uses beads on rows to represent numbers, and is still  used in parts of Asia.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Braille  was the first binary code, using an arrangement of six dots to represent  characters. The Morse code, of telegraph fame, used a dot, a dash and a series  of pauses to code words and sentences. Perhaps the most famous coding system is  DNA, which uses a base-four numeral system.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We  don’t have space to explain base two here, but it’s simple. Still, why bother?  The reason is that electronic switches can only have two states. When the  switch is “on,” that state is represented by a 1; the state of “off” is  represented by a zero.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The  advantage is that you can manipulate millions of these tiny switches on silicon  wafers in nanoseconds, using very little power. A nanosecond is a billionth of  a second. You can gather these digits together in combinations and have them  represent characters. So, if you string eight of these “bits” of information  together, you can have them represent a character, now called a “byte.” If you  use base two and represent bits in groups of eight, you have 256 possible  combinations. This is called an eight-bit byte. Originally those combinations were  used to represent 26 characters of the alphabet (lower case) and 26 characters  (upper case) and numbers, asterisks, an “at” sign and ampersands.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then  they made the byte 16 bits long, and now the possible combinations are 64,000.  Make that byte 32 bits long and the possible combinations are in the millions,  which allows us to assign <em>colors</em> to  particular bytes!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each  pixel (a spot) on a computer or TV screen consists of a byte. The latest  computers use 256-bit bytes and can be transmitted in a few nanoseconds. That’s  why our computers and TVs have become so powerful and fast. And with the new  high-density screens, the pictures can be very sharp, with lots of little bytes  on the screens (but now we call them pixels). And the hardware allows them to  be refreshed quickly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Understanding  the basics of the digital world will help you better understand how modern  technology works.</p>

    <h3><strong>Health for all people: A staph infection you  can avoid</strong></h3>
    <p><em>By </em><em>Shari</em><em> Tedford</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service</p>
    <p>It has a big name, but it’s worth  knowing about: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA.<br>
    </p>
    <p>MRSA is a strain of staph bacteria  that is resistant to a large group of common antibiotics. It was first  identified in 1945. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  MRSA is emerging as one  of the most common causes of skin infections in the United States.<br>
    </p>
    <p>MRSA had previously been found mainly among people in  hospitals, health care facilities and nursing homes who have weakened immune  systems. Infections can appear around surgical wounds, catheters or  implanted feeding tubes. Rates of infection in hospitals, especially intensive  care units, are rising throughout the world. One study found that the average  age of people with MRSA in a hospital or health care facility was 68.<br>
    </p>
    <p>But recent reports indicate that  MRSA infections acquired <em>outside</em> the  hospital setting (“community-acquired MRSA”) have increased nationally. That  occurs when someone acquires the infection who has not been hospitalized or had  a medical procedure in the past year.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What creates the conditions for developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria?  One significant cause is antibiotic overuse or misuse. The CDC says that  the spread of community-acquired MRSA has also been associated with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Close skin-to-skin contact</li>
      <li>Openings in the skin, like cuts or abrasions</li>
      <li>Contaminated items and surfaces</li>
      <li>Lack of cleanliness</li>
      <li>Crowded living conditions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Initially the infection starts with  small red bumps that resemble pimples, boils or spider bites, and it can turn into  deep, painful abscesses that require surgical draining. Sometimes the bacteria  remain confined to the skin, but they can penetrate the body, causing  potentially life-threatening infections in bones, joints, surgical wounds, bloodstream,  heart valves and lungs.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are some practical preventive steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice good hygiene. Keep your  hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Keep cuts and scrapes clean and  covered with a bandage until healed.</li>
      <li>Avoid skin contact with other  people’s wounds or bandages.</li>
      <li>Avoid sharing personal items such as  towels and razors.</li>
      <li>Do not allow people with wounds,  cuts or scrapes in your hot tub or whirlpool.</li>
      <li>Maintain a nutritious diet. This is important for  people of all ages. It can help your immune system be more resistant to disease  and infection. Choose foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which  are great sources of nutrients and vital for a healthful diet. </li>
      <li>Do  not share antibiotics with other people.</li>
      <li>Finish all prescription medications.  When you take partial doses of an antibiotic, you can increase the bacterial  resistance to the antibiotic and possibly not kill all the necessary bacteria.</li>
      <li>Allow only health care providers to  drain skin boils or abscesses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most MRSA infections are treatable with special antibiotics  or a topical antibiotic cream, but you can do much to prevent them. By understanding the disease,  you can minimize the risk of developing an infection and lower the chance that  you might spread the disease to someone else.<br>

    <h3><strong>Elder ways are  healing ways</strong></h3>
    <p><em>By Maril Crabtree</em><br>
      Kansas Senior Press Service<br>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>A review of <em>What Are Old People For? How Elders Will Save the World</em>, by William  H. Thomas, MD (VanderWyk &amp; Burnham, 2004)</p>
    </div>
    <p>William H. Thomas is a rare breed:  a geriatrician with a burning passion to make “elderhood” (his term for adults’  later years) a positive experience, something to look forward to — something that  will make a transforming contribution to our entire culture.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Thomas writes about his topic both  persuasively and provocatively. He also literally puts his money where his  mouth is; all royalties from the book go to the Center for Growing and Becoming,  a nonprofit corporation with the mission of “promoting a positive elderhood for  all.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>What makes Thomas’ book special is  his introduction of new concepts that challenge contemporary culture. His final  chapter, titled “Eldertopia,” discusses the fact that we “are headed into the  most elder-rich era of human existence and should be celebrating our good  fortune at every turn. Instead, we are in danger of squandering this historic  windfall.” <br>
    </p>
    <p>He refers to the huge influx of baby  boomers, of course, and those slightly ahead of them (like me, a “war baby,”  born in 1942). He urges this generation to do away, once and for all, with the  notion that old age is merely an “appendage” to our youth-bent ways. He points  out that the “cult of adulthood” — the insistent emphasis on always <em>doing</em> instead of quietly <em>being </em>— drives us to ignore, overlook and  remain unaware of the many important contributions our elders can make in their  own right to improve society.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In other words, elder ways are  healing ways, and our culture needs those ways as much as elders need to be  recognized as useful contributors.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This concept of “developmental  aging” allows us, he says, to “see old age as part of the ongoing miracle of  human development” and not just as a shriveling away of the vigor of youth and  the strivings of middle age. And here’s the reward: “A person who willingly  sets aside the clatter of adulthood and enters deliberately and specifically  into a life beyond adulthood becomes a beacon of hope to others.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>These are not mainstream concepts.  You will not see them reflected in many assisted living communities and nursing  facilities, where older adults often are seen as little more than frail beings  in decline. Thomas rightly tackles this “declinist bias” as counterproductive,  a perspective built from anti-aging rather than pro-aging attitudes and  assumptions. He takes on the entire long-term care industry and points out how  needlessly hierarchical and rigidly compartmentalized it can be, many of its  facilities modeled after prisons instead of being the nurturing environments  they aspire to be.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To provide a working model of his  vision, Thomas helped create a growing movement of what he calls “Green Houses,”  which he defines as groups of unrelated people who come together to create an  intentional community for elders. They receive clinical services, and they are  devoted to creating an environment rich with activities in which elders may  participate, such as meal planning and preparation, gardening, caring for  household pets and washing clothes. All people living and working in a Green House  make household decisions jointly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A pie-in-the-sky notion? Perhaps,  but several such houses already exist. This concept is only one of a dozen  stunning ideas Thomas presents to his readers. He is in it for the long haul,  and I look forward to marching into elderhood with him.<br>
    </p>
    <p>“The liberation of elders and  elderhood is not an aging issue,” he states. “It is not a generational issue.  It is not about government programs or public policy. It is not about aching  knees, weakening eyes, or even the wrinkles that line our faces. It is a  world-changing struggle that can remake the experience of life from cradle to  grave. It is our last, best, hope for saving the world from the all-conquering  power of adults.”<br>
