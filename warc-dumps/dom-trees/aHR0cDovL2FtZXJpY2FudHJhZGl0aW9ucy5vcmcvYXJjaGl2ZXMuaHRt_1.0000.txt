<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">We now have signed
into law the Obama monstrosity called the Health Care Reform Act. If this bill
is allowed to stand, it will do more to turn <st1:country-region>
<st1:place>America</st1:place>
</st1:country-region>
 into a socialist welfare state than any other legislation there has previously
been in this country. It will make the people more subjugated to the government
than they have ever been before.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">No country that has
become this socialistic has retained the basic individual freedoms that we have
in our Constitution. A good example is Canada, our neighbor to the north, and the European countries. For example, in not one
of those countries do the people have our four most basic constitutional
freedoms which are freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press,
and right to bear arms. In those countries, including <st1:country-region>Canada
and Britain, the people do not even have the basic human right of self defense. What is
strange about this is that the ideas of the natural and God given rights of self
preservation and self defense were recognized as the rights of Englishmen before
there was a United States. John Locke wrote about the natural right of self preservation; and the great
common law and legal writers, Sir Edward Coke, and Sir William Blackstone wrote
about the rights of the people to defend themselves, their families, and their
property, and the right to be armed to do so, and explained them in English law.
All of the basic human rights in our Constitution were ideas that our founders
gathered primarily from English writers, the English Assize of Arms (1181), the
Magna Carta (1215), and the English Bill of Rights (1662). Now the British have
let their governments take away those basic rights.</st1:country-region></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Socialism and
freedom are inherently contradictory. Why is it that people in these countries
have allowed the government to remove their basic God given freedoms? It appears
to me that as people become more dependent on the government, they become more
complacent and apathetic, and allow the government to take away those basic
human rights. They would rather have their government benefits and peacefully
submit. Individual responsibility and accountability are destroyed. And so are
drive and initiative to get ahead, accomplish things, and do well in the world.
Also, disarming the people so that they must peacefully submit to government
control of their lives has always been a requisite for communist and socialist
governments.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">I also believe that
President Obama and the other Democrats have misinformed the people about the
health care bill. They say that it is not the taking over of health care by the
government. This is blatantly false. The government will have control over all
aspects of health care. They also say that there is no "death panel."
That name may not be used but I believe that the statement is false. I recommend
that you read the article, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">'Death panel'
is not in the bill ... it already exists</b>, by Joseph Ashby. (<a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/08/death_panel_is_not_in_the_bill.html">http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/08/death_panel_is_not_in_the_bill.html</a>)<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">There are also grave
doubts about the constitutionality of the health care bill. Many provisions of
it appear to me to be unconstitutional, but liberal Supreme Court justices have
been inching in this direction for some time. They have no respect for our
Constitution, and what the Court will do in this case remains to be seen. We
have only four real conservatives presently on the United States Supreme Court.
A good short article on the constitutionality of the bill is <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Health
Care and the Constitution</b>, by a top-notch constitutional scholar (who
incidentally isn't even a lawyer), David Barton. (<a href="http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=49126">http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=49126</a>)</p>

Craddock: <b><a href="Articles/America's%20Coming%20Cultural%20Revolution.htm">America's

</p>
<p align="left">There is something that I would add in light of the recent
massacre of a number of our military personnel at Fort Hood, Texas, by a radical
Islamist. The government and the media continually try to cover up the fact that
persecution and violence against "non-believers" is a natural result
of the Islamic religion. The Koran, "the sacred text of Islam," and the basis of the Islamic
and Muslim religions, supports the intolerance, violence, and terrorism of
Muslims toward other religions, and the people who follow them. It is the basis
of the killing and stoning of Muslims, themselves, who have strayed from Islamic
teachings, and particularly if they have become "Christianized." These
things have gone on ever since there was a Muslim religion. All religions are
not the same, and entitled to equal respect, as our liberal government and the
general media try to teach us. Such ideas are ridiculous to any thinking person,
and only those who keep their heads in the sand do not recognize that which is
obvious.&nbsp;

some of our churches accepted sodomy and homosexual marriage as commendable
things, they have adopted <b>SIECUS</b> sex education programs to brainwash
their children into the acceptance of these things. Children as young as those
in kindergarten are to be given this "sex-education." In practice, in
public schools, this kind of "sex education"
takes up some very gross pornographic illustrations of sex acts -- both
homosexual and heterosexual. It is all treated as acceptable for children to
engage in such things. I am sure it will work the same in the churches. The sodomizing of these churches is now complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Barack
Hussein Obama could well turn out to be the very worst president this country
has ever had or will have. His policies and proposed legislation follow very
closely the ideas of his radical communist friends and associates, William Ayres
and Bernardine Dohrn.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">His stated plans and
proposed legislation include socializing our health care system; and
redistributing the wealth by taxing the more productive in our society and
giving their lawfully earned money to the "less fortunate." This is
particularly destructive when we are in a deep recession. Taking money away from
the productive, who use their capital to run businesses that supply jobs, goods,
and services, and giving that money to those who are producing nothing, will
turn us into a weak third world type country. It is exactly how a country
becomes a welfare state. A strong productive America

 may be a thing of the past. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Obama has been
making a lot of speeches lately, and every time he does the stock market takes
another trip downward. His socialist ideas do not sit well with the people who
invest the money that runs the businesses in this country.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">In the two articles,
<b><a href="Articles/our_2008_financial_crisis.htm">Our 2008 Financial Crisis
Was Caused by the Democrats</a></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">,<b> </b>and <b><a href="Articles/obama_and_acorn_directly_contrib.htm">Obama
and ACORN Directly Contributed to Our 2008 Economic Crisis</a></b>,<b> </b>facts
were presented showing how the democrats, in limiting our oil production and
bringing about high gasoline prices; and more importantly in pressuring banks
and lending agencies into making housing loans to "poor people" who
could not afford them, primarily brought about our present recession. In the
second article, Obama's personal activities in this regard, along with his
radical long-time associate, ACORN, are explained. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Worse yet, now that he is President, Obama's stated policies and proposed
legislation are aimed at helping those who could not afford the bad loans keep
the homes they could not afford by reducing their mortgages, or having the
government pay part of them. And the federal agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, who were at the root of these bad loans, and went broke making and
guaranteeing the loans, are being "bailed out" and allowed to keep up
their destructive practices. Tremendous amounts of government funds will be
needed for such policies, and it will all be capital used for unproductive
purposes that could be, if not taken away from those who earned it, used to
create jobs and produce badly needed goods and services. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">All of this will also lead to inflation, and there can be nothing worse
than inflated prices for goods and services during a deep recession.</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Obama is supporting a change in the law on labor unions that would
eliminate the secret ballot. Union "goons" have long been known for
their "leaning" on workers to unionize. Many times physical abuse and
even murder has been resorted to. If union organizers can threaten and pressure
a majority of the workers in a business into signing a card that they want a
union, the business will have to accept union representation, and all workers
will have to pay union dues. It is hard for workers to resist this
"pressure," when applied to each of them individually, in private, one
at a time. There will be no secret ballot that protects the workers from both
the unions and management, as there is now. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">The primary reason our automobile companies and many other industries are
in danger of bankruptcy is because of oppressive union contracts. It is also the
reason that many companies have either gone broke or moved their operations to
foreign countries.</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">It is not just
Obama's economic policies that are so radical – his social policies and ideas
are equally radical. In the article, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><a href="Articles/barack_hussein_obama.htm">Barack
Hussein Obama is a Fraud</a></b>, I related facts showing what a hypocrite he
is. He professes to be a Christian. His actions and policies show that he is the
opposite. When he was in the <st1:state>
<st1:place>
Illinois</st1:place>
</st1:state>
 legislature, he continually opposed legislation that would have protected
babies from being left to die that survived an abortion and were born alive. He
supports the heinous procedure of partial birth abortion. Although sodomy is one
of the most condemned things in the Bible, Obama expressed his belief that
sodomy is moral.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Obama plans to
reverse President Bush's "conscience rule" that provided that
healthcare workers may refuse to conduct or participate in performing abortions,
without repercussions, when against moral views. People will be forced to do
things which they consider extremely wrong and sinful.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">As Dr. James C.
Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, states in his news letter of February,
2009, on Obama's social programs: "He has taken dead-aim at the institution
of the family and the moral principles on which it is based." He plans to
try to extend even further the rights for abortions on all fronts. He plans to
repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act which provides that a same-sex
relationship shall not be considered a marriage under federal law, even if
recognized as such by a state; and that no state shall be compelled to recognize
same-sex marriages of another state. There is no clearer support for homosexual
marriage, although Obama falsely told us when he was running for President that
he was against homosexual marriage.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">A good article on
Obama's radical views on children and sexuality is <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Obama
even supports teaching sex education to small children, even those in
kindergarten. And such a "sex education" would include teaching
children that there is nothing wrong with unmarried young people engaging in

<p class="BlockSingle">To say that the November, 2008, election disappointed me
is a gross understatement. I am sorely afraid that we are fast moving toward a
socialistic welfare state, with a loss of our basic constitutional
freedoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">In older times, unscrupulous politicians offered citizens
a dollar to vote for them, and the dollar either came out of their own pocket or
from their political contributions. Barack Obama took this misbehavior to a
point that was heretofore unheard of. He promised the majority of Americans that
if they would elect him the government would give them each $1,000, and that it
would be taken away from the more productive Americans by increasing their
income tax. The $1,000 is clearly a handout to people who did nothing whatsoever
to earn the money, and many of whom have paid no income tax at all; and it is to
be taken away from those who honestly earned it. The gifts are not even restricted to those who are
in need of charity. It is contrary to any concept of fairness and justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">This "Robin Hood" and Marxist approach to government -- robbing the rich and giving to the
poor -- is the thing that was most feared about
a democracy by our Founders, as explained more fully by the article on this
website, <i><b><a href="Articles/why_our_founders_feared_a_democr.htm">Why
Our Founders Feared a Democracy</a></b></i>.&nbsp;The following is a historical quote of long standing from
the article that is worth repeating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="BlockSingle">A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of
government. <b>It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote
themselves largesse from the public treasury</b>. From that moment on, the
majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the
public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose
fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
greatest civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through
this sequence: "From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to
great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From
abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to apathy; From apathy to dependence;
From dependence back into bondage." (Emphasis added) <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

</blockquote>
<p class="BlockSingle">Certainly there has never before in our history been a
presidential candidate promising as much "<b>largesse from the public treasury</b>"
as Barack Obama.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">When the people become so
devoid of principles that they vote for someone who promises to give them the
most money, property, or government services, rather than for what is good for the country as a whole, democracy
does not work as a government that our Founders wanted for us. They very much
hoped that when people voted they would be guided by the Christian principle of <b>do
unto others as you would have them do unto you.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="BlockSingle">Noah Webster, one of our great Forefathers,&nbsp; a well known educator,
as well as author of our first American dictionary, said:</p>
<blockquote>

  </span>The preservation of a republican government depends on the faithful
  discharge of this duty; if the citizens neglect their duty, and place
  unprincipled men in office, the government will soon be corrupted; laws will
  be made, not for the public good, so much as for selfish or local purposes;
  corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws; the public

more than forty years, since the 1960s, there has been a steep decline in

socialist country or a welfare state where the people have the basic human freedoms that we have
under our Constitution. If we continue in our present direction, we can expect
the further, and fast, erosion of the rights our Founders gave us in our Constitution.
And Barack Obama has explicitly stated that it is his intention to appoint
typical liberal judges. These will be judges that have no respect for our
Constitution and our Bill of Rights, and will change them to fit their own
personal views and biases.&nbsp;Each such change they make destroys some of our

<p class="BoldCenter" align="center"><b>Cultural <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Destruction
Caused by Socialism and Welfare States</b></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">As explained in the
article, Why Our Founders Feared a Democracy, the very thing they feared is
happening today. The people are beginning to vote for the candidate that
promises them the most. President John F. Kennedy said: "Ask not what your
country can do for you – but what you can do for your country." This
principle has now been completely reversed, and it is fast leading us into
socialism and a welfare state. The people who support our government by paying
more in taxes than they get from the government are getting fewer and fewer.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Democrats increase
their constituency by getting more people dependent on the government, and they
continue to promise them more and more. Now the primary constituencies of the
Democrats are those dependent on the government, generational welfare
recipients, abortionists, atheists and anti-Christian groups, and homosexual
groups. Another constituency is the labor unions. However, I believe that a
labor union which has an interest in good workmanship and efficient production,
as well as the welfare of its employees is a good thing. This would lead to less
of our production being done outside of our country. But the working class with
this outlook is not likely to support the present Democratic party.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Human initiative is
stifled – it is too easy for people to survive without working. We get
generations of families on welfare. We get generations of children born to unwed
mothers, and all cared for by the government. These people seem to lose any
ability to find work, make their own living, and contribute to their country.
This is of course brought about by the Democrats – these welfare families are
an important part of their constituency – and they work hard to get these
people to the polls on election day. Such people contribute nothing to the
country, and should not even be voting.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">As people become
more dependent on the government they become apathetic as the government takes
from them their basic rights. Communism, socialism, and welfare states are all
incompatible with both Christianity and basic human rights. In the end, they are
all Godless societies that subjugate the people to the wishes of those in
government. Such governments try to remove all semblances of Christianity and
religion from the country's culture. This is going on at a fast rate today, with
our liberal leaning courts taking an active part in it. Laws are passed and
schools take action to try to force people into the "political
correctness" of the liberal views. False history is taught in the schools,
and students are brainwashed with the liberal viewpoint, even though its factual
basis is false.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">The Democrats today
embrace not only abortion, but killing babies while they are being delivered
(partial birth abortion), and even killing babies after they are born when
abortion fails to kill them. The Democrats' nominee for President, Barack
Hussein Obama, supports all of these inhuman things. (See the article, Facts,
Truth and Morals are Irrelevant to Democrats, in the Articles section of this
website.)</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">The Democrats now
support immorality from beginning to end, and continue to try to remove all of
our Christian heritages. This goes with socialism, as does the removal of our
constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">One of the most
important parts of our Constitution is the exclusive right in the people to
change the Constitution. This, with our republic form of government, makes it a
government of the people, by the people, and for the people. By judicial fiat,
liberal judges, such as a Democrat President will appoint, destroy this right of
the people to pass their own laws and govern themselves. There are many examples
of this when it comes to religion. A couple relate to saying the pledge of
allegiance, and displaying the Ten Commandments. A recent example is in <st1:state>
<st1:place>California</st1:place>
</st1:state>
 where the people and their representatives passed a law prohibiting homosexual
marriage, and their Supreme Court struck it down – falsely creating a
constitutional right not only to sodomy, but to homosexual marriage. Our United
States Supreme Court did a similar thing when it struck down numerous state laws
prohibiting sodomy and falsely declared that there is a constitutional right to
engage in sodomy.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">If Barack Hussein
Obama is elected President, we can look forward to a Godless socialistic
society, and the further loss of our rights under our Constitution.</p>

<p class="BoldCenter" align="center"><b>CONSERVATIVE JUDGES ARE NECESSARY</b></p>
<p class="BoldCenter" align="center"><b>TO PRESERVE OUR CONSTITUTION</b></p>
<p class="BlockSingle"><o:p>
&nbsp;Judicial decisions, many of which effect and bind our whole country,
should not be based upon politics, or personal biases of judges. I think that
all reasonable people should be able to agree on this basic and fundamental
principle.</o:p></p>
<p class="BlockSingle">There is only one way that a judge's personal biases can
be kept from effecting a decision. That is to use correct principles and rules
to arrive at a decision. And the only correct principle for interpreting a
provision of our Constitution is to arrive at the intent and purpose for which
the provision was enacted. This same principle applies to the interpretation of
all written documents. It is a matter of common sense and logic. Examples in the
legal field are provisions of a constitution, statutes, wills, and contracts.
Unfortunately, this basic principle is most violated when interpreting the most
important of all legal documents – our Constitution.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">If a judge can be depended upon to follow correct
principles in deciding a matter, then we do not need to worry over what his
politics and personal biases are.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
all have them. Consider what an improvement that would be to what we now have.
The President appoints federal judges, and no matter what the political
persuasions of the President at the time, there are continual delays and
obstructions to appointments, as each side jockeys and maneuvers to get a
favorable judge and block an unfavorable judge. What a blessing to our country
it would be if this could be eliminated. And it easily can be eliminated.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">We need to understand what I mean by a conservative
judge. I mean a judge that sets aside all of his personal views when deciding a
constitutional provision, and decides it according to the intent and purpose of
those who enacted it. I do not mean a judge who is influenced by his
conservative political views, and I do not mean a judge that is influenced by
his liberal political views. Both conservatives and liberals have made erroneous
and harmful decisions, when influenced by their political views; although it is
my studied opinion that liberals are much more bent in that direction.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">You may wonder how you determine the intent and purpose
of a constitutional provision that was enacted more than 200 years ago. Actually
it is easy. The records are many and voluminous. They are such things as the
Federalist papers, published statements made by our Founders who worked on
framing the provisions, and on getting them ratified. Reliable history of our
country prior to the enactment can also have a bearing on such things as what
was meant at that time by the phrase, "establishment of religion", as
used in the First Amendment, and "Militia", as used in the Second
Amendment. The existing federal and state laws at the time of enactment of a
provision can have a bearing.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">I have written a book, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
Way To Save Our Constitution From Judges</i>, that explains in detail the ease
with which the intent and purpose behind provisions of our Constitution can be
determined. The complete book is made available on this website. It also
explains in detail the destruction that has been done to our Constitution by
judicial activism in particular cases, where decisions are based on the
political and personal views of United States Supreme Court justices. Also
included at the end of the book is the recommendation for a simple
constitutional amendment that would cure all of these problems and would prevent
activist judges from deciding constitutional matters according their own
personal political views and other personal biases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle">Erroneous decisions have been made by the Supreme Court
in what could be classified both to the left and to the right in the political
spectrums. During the last fifty years the greatest harm has been done to our
Constitution by liberal leftist decisions. One of the most basic rights in our
Constitution – a government of the people, by the people and for the people,
has been usurped by activist judges. They are turning it into a government of
the judges, by the judges, and for the judges, according to their political and
social views. The rights under our Constitution that were given to the people,
and solely to the people, have been maliciously and purposefully taken from them
by the judges, and wrongfully given to themselves. Very numerous specific
examples and cases of this are detailed in the book referred to. The people have
put up with this usurpation of their rights far too long.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">Under Article V of our
United States Constitution, only the people and their representatives have the
right to change our Constitution. And this right is federally weighted by
states. Sometime, our country will put a stop to the ability of judges to
overstep their authority and usurp this basic right of the people; but until
then, the people should elect conservative presidents that will appoint
conservative judges. Of course, the liberals fight this vigorously; because they
want judges that will unlawfully do what the people will not do, and that is
change the Constitution to what they want it to be.&nbsp; <o:p>

  laboratory, say that Earth has passed the peak of its warmer period, and a
  fairly cold spell will set in quite soon, by 2012. Real cold will come when

those who understand our constitutional law. It was never intended by our

<p align="left">A new book, <b><i><a href="Import/A%20Way%20To%20Save%20Our%20Consitution%20From%20Judges.doc">A
Way to Save Our Constitution From Judges</a></i></b><a href="Import/A%20Way%20To%20Save%20Our%20Consitution%20From%20Judges.doc">,</a>&nbsp;
by O. R. Adams Jr., has been added to the Books section. (Click on the Title to
go to the book.)</p>
<p>This is a book that is first being published on this website. It is a
comprehensive book that covers in detail particular cases that have been decided
by our Courts -- particularly the United States Supreme Court, and the damage
done to our Constitution by some of these decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Article V of our Constitution, provides that our Constitution may be changed
only by the people and their representatives. It takes two thirds of both houses
of our federal legislature, or two thirds of the legislatures of the states, to
commence an amendment. It then must be approved by three fourths of the legislatures&nbsp;
of the states or by conventions in three fourths of the states -- thus providing
for strong federal weighting. Yet liberal Supreme Court justices have often
usurped this sole right of the people and their representatives, and unlawfully
changed our Constitution to their own liking -- often by bare majorities of the
Court. This is indeed a disgraceful situation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The basic problem is that our Constitution has no curb for activist judges,
except impeachment, which they obviously do not fear. There is nothing in our
Constitution that states how a law or a constitutional provision should be
interpreted by the courts. The courts, and particularly the United States
Supreme Court, make their own rules for interpretation. Although our early
Supreme Court justices developed rules for interpretation that determined the
meaning for a provision of our Constitution to be that which was intended by
those who formed and ratified it, later liberal justices left those long
accepted rules, and began substituting their own personal views thereby clanging
our Constitution from what was intended by those forming and enacting it to what
these particular liberal judges thought it should be.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This judicial misbehavior by liberal judges has imposed completely erroneous
meanings that must now be followed because by the Court's own interpretations
these decisions are now controlling. The article on this website, Saving Our Constitution
From Judges, is a concise summary of this book.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The book contains an easy way that this damage can be prevented by a simple
Constitutional amendment requiring that judges construe the meaning of a provision
to be that which was intended by those responsible for enacting it, as it should
be, and as it was long ago recognized by our early courts.&nbsp;This would also
take judges out of politics and put them back into being judges as was intended
by our Constitution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The proposed amendment would not only prevent such future damage to our
Constitution, but, in time, would tend to correct all erroneous decisions that
have been made in the past.&nbsp;

(Click the Title to go to the article.) The
demise of prior democracies has been brought about primarily by the belief of
the people that the government should take care of their various needs and
wishes. They have developed a Robin Hood mentality to soak the rich and give to
the poor, which eventually destroys the government, and the individual freedoms
of the people. While they receive their government benefits, they do not have
the will and energy to resist the destruction of their God given Freedoms. Our
Founders tried to guard against that very problem, knowing why all prior tries
at democracy had miserably failed.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">One of the great
historical and political writings of our times was the two volume book, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Democracy

healthcare and other benefits. The idea of President John F. Kennedy, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">"ask

candidates of today think that the person who can get elected is the person who
can promise the most government benefits to the people. This is the exact thing
that our Founders feared. It leads to a socialized welfare state, the loss of
individual freedom and of individual initiative. It will lead to the demise of <st1:country-region>

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

received a number of emails making derogatory claims about Obama's Muslim
background, which appears to be a bit murky. Some of the allegations do not
appear to be well-founded.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">One email in
particular says that the information was checked out in snopes.com. One of the
allegations is that Obama conceals the fact he is now a Muslim. Certainly,
snopes.com does not support that statement. Another was that when he was sworn
in (sworn in to what?) he used the Koran instead of the Bible. This appears to
be erroneous. From my research, when he was sworn in as a United States Senator,
the Bible was used. The snopes.com information can be found at <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/obama.asp">http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/obama.asp</a>.
However, this also should be taken with a grain of salt. The Snopes information
seems biased in favor of Obama, in that it takes as support statements made by
Obama and his campaign managers, which I do not consider objective.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">One interesting
thing that the Snopes information has is the picture of Obama , Hillary Clinton,
Bill Richardson, and another woman on the stage during the playing of the
National Anthem while displaying the flag. The other three stand there
respectfully at attention, with their hands over their hearts, while Obama
slouches there with his hands folded down by his crotch, showing complete
disrespect for both our National Anthem and the American Flag. It is no wonder
people are suspicious of him. The Snopes bunch, further showing their leftist
bias, make the statement:</p>
<blockquote>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">The Flag was
apparently being displayed out in front of the stage, and a large flag was
behind the stage making the Flag rather clearly displayed. How the custom can be
honored in the breach, is a rather peculiar statement that Snopes does not
attempt to explain. They then try to cover it up by supplying other pictures of
Obama with his hand over his heart, furnished by the Obama campaign. They do not
explain when or why the other pictures were made, which may have been merely for
the purpose of trying to make it appear that Obama just made an inadvertent
mistake at the time in question. I saw the scene on television of Barack and the
others made at the time it happened, as I am sure that a great many other people
in the country did. He displayed obvious disrespect for our National Anthem and
our Flag, and I do not believe that he is so stupid that it could have been
inadvertent. I hope that if Obama gets the Democratic nomination, that the
Republicans get out advertisements showing the scene and play it over and over,
asking the people if this is the kind of person we want to be President of our
Country, and Commander in Chief of our armed forces. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Many leftists,
generally, have little respect for our American institutions such as our
National Anthem, our Flag, the Pledge of Allegiance, and all of our statements
and symbols that include the word, God. Many of them, because of their
evolutionary brainwashing in our schools, do not believe in God; and deceitfully
want God eliminated from our national history and American heritage. Truth and
morality mean nothing to them.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">As to whether or not
Obama was ever a Muslim and worshipped that faith, I think an article that is
much more balanced than the Snopes information is a recent FrontPage article,

federal Defense of Marriage Act, as well as the Marriage Amendment to prevent
homosexual marriage.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">He believes that
"gays" who admittedly are actively engaged in pursuing sodomy should
be allowed in the military. This would not only include changing the present
policy, but would necessitate repealing the part of the Code of Military Justice

tremendous adverse effect on not only the morality of the military, but on their
morale. In the book, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">As

they want to eliminate our right to have the means of protecting ourselves from

will take our money from us and dribble part of it back to us in ways that it

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-tab-count:

are engaged in an all out push to convert us to atheism. They are even more
effective than the organization bearing the misnomer, American Civil <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

their exact opposite and the greatest danger to their religion of atheism.
Unlike
many of the forthright atheists and evolutionists, such as Richard Dawkins, the
media and academia seldom candidly admit their true purpose.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-tab-count:

is that one has no conscience to be bothered by sinful acts – because to them
there is no such thing as the Biblical concept of sin. Progress is made in that
direction when "tolerance" leads us to accept things that we once well
knew were sinful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, those who
are members of the religions of Atheism and Evolution <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>would
have us believe otherwise. They would have us believe that they have a set of

moral code of the atheists. I have unsuccessfully tried. Who has the authority
to make such a moral code? Is it an immutable moral code, such as we have in
various religions, or is it subject to change by those who would take it upon
themselves to design it? It is of course meaningless. No human has anymore right
to say what is moral than the next. It would have to be something continually
changing as ideas change. What is considered immoral today could be considered
perfectly moral, tomorrow. We have that very thing happening in the secular
elements of our society today. Examples are the acceptance as moral of living
together out of wedlock, having children out of wedlock, and sodomy. It indeed
takes a confused mind to accept such sins as "moral." <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

This Time article is severely criticized by Joel Belz in his article, "<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Practical

As Belz says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Indent1"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>For the truest and most effective proponents of godlessness are almost
  never those who are most blatant about their mission. They are instead those
  who purport to pick up any topic at all for further discussion—and then
  leave God out of that conversation. Do that with a dozen such discussions, or
  maybe 20 or 100, and you don't have to do much more. You've implicitly made
  your case. God doesn't exist—or if He does, He doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="Indent1"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>No example could be more telling than Time's Dec. 3 issue, whose cover
brashly announces the main article: "What Makes Us Good/Evil."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">The
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Time</i> article referred to tries to make
sense out of nonsense</b>. The gist of the article, by Jeffrey Kluger, is the
Darwinian evolutionist approach of trying to put humans on the same plane as
animals such as apes, gorillas, and others, and of course eliminating God from
the equation. Kluger argues that all of us animals are equipped with "moral
programming." I would suggest that what some animals are equipped with is
survival programming. And that this survival programming leads to very immoral
behavior in many animals, such as lions, in destroying (murdering?) their
competition, including newborn cubs. But assuming for the sake of argument that
Kluger is right, and I am wrong, I ask: From where does this moral programming
come? No explanation as to this problem is given. This kind of person would of
course necessarily try to explain that it came about by evolution – but he
would utterly fail in the attempt. Such programming would necessarily be of
"intelligent design," and this cannot be considered by the
evolutionist and atheist, because he finds it impossible to explain intelligent
design without a "designer."</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Belz says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Indent1"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>The possibility that a meaningful God—or even a meaningless god, for
  that matter—is part of such a discussion gets not a single mention. In more
  than 3,000 words, the broad topic of "religion" is never suggested.
  There's not a hint that anybody has ever talked about something called the
  "Fall." It's breathtaking, in fact, that Time could take on a cover
  story like "What Makes Us Good/Evil?" and leave out so much that
  seems so basic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly I agree that
animals show the ability to love, show empathy, and reason intelligently. These
abilities in humans are more intense and complex. They are very obviously a part
of the many evidences of intelligent design in nature. It certainly takes a
closed mind to argue that intelligence itself, which is all about us, is not
evidence of intelligent design. But the atheist and the Darwinian evolutionist
must take that position – otherwise he is put in a place that he is determined
not to go.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The human brain has the
intelligence to design, understand, and use such things as the game of chess. No
one can deny that the complex game of chess is intelligently designed – even
atheists and evolutionists must admit that. Yet these latter groups must deny
that the brain itself shows evidence of intelligent design, even though it is
enormously more complex and integrated in operation than the game of chess that
it can design. One must check his brain at the door, and enter without it, to
believe that there is no evidence that the brain is intelligently designed. In
truth, every part of humans, animals, plants, trees, and every other living
thing, exhibits evidence of intelligent design. And intelligent design is the
death knell of atheism and Darwinian evolution. That is of course why they fight
so hard to keep even consideration of it out of our schools. <o:p>

normal">When we lose our moral compass of the Christian and Judaic religions. we
constantly go the wrong directions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></b>We
can see the results all around us in our society. We should take a close look at
what is going on around us today, and ponder this proposition. Some of the
things we might consider are the following.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">This is the month
that we have traditionally celebrated Christmas. Now, due to liberal majority
decisions by our Supreme Court, and other courts, Christmas is substantially
barred from public places, and in our schools. Even some of our department
stores are not using the word. But paganism is welcome – particularly in our
schools.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Not many years ago,
pornography was barred from the airways, from movies, and from the mail. Today,
all of these are replete with filth and pornography; and the Supreme Court of
the <st1:country-region>
<st1:place>
United States</st1:place>
</st1:country-region>
 has even declared a constitutional right to pornography.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Not many years ago,
abortion was against the law in many of our states, and except in exigent
circumstances, in all states. Now because of our Supreme Court's ruling in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roe
v. Wade</i>, abortion on demand is legal in most states; and even the right of a
state to bar late term abortions and partial birth abortions is in doubt.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Until recent years
it would have been unthinkable to bar the Bible and prayer in schools, and now
even saying the word, God, in school, or voluntary prayer of a student, can lead
to severe punishment. But "sex education," which is actually promoting
elicit sex, is prevalent, and condoms and birth control pills are handed out to
very young students.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Prior to the 1960s,
sodomy was a crime in every state. Now these vile acts that are a crime against
nature and God are considered by many to be acceptable "alternative
lifestyles." Our children are taught in schools that sodomy is a
commendable practice, and encouraged to engage in it and try it out.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Gambling, and
addiction to gambling, has had a tremendous upsurge in our country. Even many of
our states are directly engaged in gambling, and advertise to attract people to
it.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">A by-product of our
modern liberalism, is that today living together out of wedlock is common, and
accepted by many, and a very large portion of our children born today are born
out of wedlock.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">These shifts in our
culture began in the 1960s, with the drug and hippie era, and have continued
rapidly since then.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Each of us should
examine our own ideas, and consider whether or not we have allowed things which
we once knew were wrong to become acceptable to us. We should consider the basis
for our changes in our ideas of what is right and what is wrong. A society can
change from Christian principles to paganism, and that which is wrong can become
completely acceptable. We should each ask ourselves: Have I compromised my
principles to please others, or to keep from offending others? If I have, then a
part of the blame is on me. Some have accepted as moral that which is immoral in
deference to what their own children are doing. That is actually a disservice to
the children, who will be encouraged to further compromise what morals they may
have left – all of which will then be handed down to their children.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">We either have
immutable moral principles, handed down to us by a higher authority, or we have
no sound moral basis. If morality is to be based on the current prevailing ideas
of the people, it can go in any direction at any time. Morality then becomes a
meaningless word. There is none. Morals have been exchanged for mores.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Also,
we should each consider what we individually have done to make our country a
better and more moral country, and what we may have done to take it in the
opposite direction.</p>

Truth, and Morals are Irrelevant to Democrats</font></a>. </b>It deals primarily with
certain issues embraced by current Democratic presidential candidates.</p>
<p>The campaigns for the 2008 presidential election is heating up, and it is
interesting to see the radical and immoral things come to light that are
supported by all of the major Democratic candidates. Some things they try to
hide and to sidestep, but a close examination will bring out the truth. It
appears that there is no extreme radical and immoral thing in issue that is not
supported by the Democrats and their liberal cohorts.</p>
<p>They are pro-abortion, no matter how extreme and how cruel. They even believe
in finishing off the killing of babies that have managed to survive abortions
and have actually been born and are alive.</p>
<p>They would teach us that the vile and depraved acts of sodomy are an
acceptable thing in our society. Although many sidestep the homosexual marriage
issue, in public, they actually support it, and all support the recognition of
legal unions of those engaging in sodomy.</p>
<p>The Democrats, and their cohort, the ACLU, continually work to promote and
protect pornography – even child pornography. They of course are also aided
greatly by liberal members of our courts – particularly those on the Untied
States Supreme Court. Prior to the successes of the liberal movements, we did
not have pornography in our movies, or on television, and it was illegal to send
pornography through the mail. Now the movies, television, and the internet are
laden with pornographic filth; and we cannot now even completely bar child
pornography from the airways.</p>
<p>They support every environmental movement that anyone can dream up, no matter
how radical or ill informed, from protecting the silvery minnow in New Mexico,
the spotted owl in the Northwest, to their big thing now – Global warming –
ignoring all evidence contrary to their views.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">In the article,
specific things and references are presented on each of these things. One thing
covered is how foolish our Governor, Bill Richardson made himself look in his
appearance before the homosexual community in Los Angeles the other day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked whether
he thought that homosexuality is by choice or biological, he said it was
choice, which is probably true. His error was that it does not fit the
homosexual agenda. It was his pathetic gyrations when they got after him that
make him look so comical.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Something else that
I think is interesting, and that informed citizens today should know is data
showing that other planets are warming up, and that this could not be caused by
anything going on earth. Also, some information is given on the many times in
the past that the earth has undergone both ice ages and global warming – much

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">In the other amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, we have a
number of other basic freedoms, including the important right of not being
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. But a person
can be deprived of life, liberty, and property with due process of law. Our
Constitution recognizes no due process of law by which those first six basic
rights may be eliminated, other than of course by an amendment to the
Constitution. I believe that all of these things were carefully considered by
our Founders, and that they considered the rights listed above, numbered 2
through 6, as basic to protecting all of our other Constitutional rights. <o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">With freedom of speech and press, all ideas, and all sides of an issue
may be presented. This leads to increased learning by everyone, and to a better
society. The liberal idea of allowing only speech which they consider
politically correct prohibits the exploring of other ideas. This is certainly
detrimental to learning, and, sadly, it is practiced most in our schools which
are supposed to be places of learning and exploring different ideas. As long as
it is polite and dignified, no issue, and no side of any issue should be
prohibited from discussion. This includes such current issues as global warming,
evolution, intelligent design, racial issues such as affirmative action and
diversity, and social issues such as abortion and homosexuality. Evidently
liberals realize that many of their ideas cannot withstand objective
examination, and that is why they want to prohibit discussion and presentation
of opposing views. Truth and logic is considered by them to be irrelevant when
it is contrary to their doctrines.<o:p>

<p align="CENTER"><a name="July, 2007"></a>July, 2007</p>
<p>We again will celebrate Independence Day on July, 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>I think that we should reflect on the importance of Independence Day.
By this declaration, representatives of the thirteen colonies came together and
declared their independence from England. They became thirteen states. In
effect, at that time they were thirteen separate countries – each of which, by
itself, was rather an insignificant figure in the world, as a country.</p>
<p>Included in the Books section is the <i>Declaration of Independence and
the Constitution of the United States</i>. At the end of the Declaration are
the names of the courageous and farsighted individuals who signed it. It
was rather literally remarked by one of them that "we can now either hang
together or we will hang separately."</p>
<p>For purposes of conducting the resulting Revolutionary War, a loose
Confederation of the States was formed. It was a difficult and unwieldy form of
government during that war; and proved completely ineffective as a united
government after the war. Delegates from the states met at Annapolis in 1786 to
try to devise some answer to their problems, and the result was a recommendation
for a convention of representatives of the states to meet in Philadelphia on the
second Monday of May of the next year, for the purpose of devising a plan to
remedy the defects of the Confederation. Congress accepted the recommendation
and adopted a resolution calling a convention "for the sole and express
purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation and reporting ... such
alterations ... as shall ... render the Federal Constitution adequate to the
exigencies of Government and the preservation of the Union." (<i>The
Fathers of the Constitution</i>, by Max Farrand, 1921)</p>
<p>The states selected their leading men to send as delegates. The caliber of
these men can be judged from history, and the ones who signed the Constitution
are listed at the end of the Constitution, immediately before the Bill of
Rights, in the copy of this document in the Books section of this website. In my
opinion, there has never been such a competent group of leaders gathered to work
on a plan of government – before or since. The delegates to the convention
began arriving at Philadelphia on May 14, 1787, and, after ten days, a
sufficient number hade arrived to begin work in the convention.</p>
<p>Although there were strong differences in ideas and opinions on such things
as states rights, federalism as contrasted to more of a democracy, and slavery,
finally, on September 17, 1787, these patriots finished the greatest document
for government that there has ever been before or since – our United states
Constitution. Congress adopted the Constitution and sent it to the states for
ratification. In the first Congress, after ratification, James Madison, keeping
his promise on the matter, moved for the addition of a Bill of Rights, which was
worked out, sent to the states and ratified.</p>
<p>How was it that these strong minded men, with their divergent views, were
able to produce such an enlightened document for government. Perhaps the way
these men viewed their mission is the key, as witnessed by their own statements
at the beginning of the convention. James Madison said, "Now to decide
forever the fate of Republican government." Gouverneur Morris stated,
"The whole human race will be affected by the proceedings of this
convention." James Wilson said, "After the lapse of six thousand years
since the creation of the world America now presents the first instance of a
people assembled to weigh deliberately and calmly and to decide leisurely and
peacefully upon the form of government by which they will bind themselves and
their posterity." (<i>The Fathers of the Constitution</i>)</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if politicians of our time were possessed of such
sincerity. But most of them today have become subservient to parties and to
groups.</p>
<p>Our Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, was for each and every free
man and woman. And after the Civil War amendments (XIII, XIV, and XV), all
people in America were free.</p>
<p>Our Bill of rights is for each and every person. It is not for certain people
or certain groups. We should guard against destroying those rights by the
granting of rights to certain groups. Each time a special right is given to a
group – whether based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender – it
cuts into our basic rights as individuals. The individualism and self reliance
of our Forefathers has been rapidly fading. In its place we are installing
"political correctness" and many aspects of socialism.</p>

</b>
<p>I have written a lengthy article, <b>Liberal Revisionists Present False
History and Moral Decay</b>, and added it to the Articles section. For a long
time this country and other countries have been undergoing continual
brainwashing by various liberal groups, including feminists, homosexualists,
and atheists. Their successes have been truly astounding.</p>
<p>"Gay", "homophobia" and the words derived from it, are
words made up by the "gay" movement for their propaganda purposes.
"Gay" is for the purpose of making sodomy seem less depraved than it
is. Homophobic, homophobia and such are to intimidate and deride those who think
and say that sodomy is wrong. Let's look at <i>Webster's New</i> <i>Twentieth
Century Dictionary of the English Language</i> – Unabridged, 1966. Homophobia,
and such derivatives, were not in there at all. As to the word Gay, the first
definition was "joyous and lively; merry; happy; lighthearted." The
last definition was "wanton; licentious; as, a gay dog." Not one
definition meant homosexual, as it is used today. But the media, academia, and
the gullible segment of our society dutifully parrot these words, now, just as
was intended by the homosexual movement to further its propaganda and thought
control. And they find their way into our dictionaries.</p>
<p>These groups have also had great success in revising our dictionaries,
history, and even the Bible in furtherance of their programs of brainwashing and
thought control.</p>
<p>Words indicating gender and the differences between men and women must be
eliminated from our vocabulary. We must realize that sodomy is not wrong, but a
commendable activity in which to engage. The atheists and many of the
homosexualists want to completely destroy Christianity, and falsely change
history to eliminate the place it played in the founding of this country and its
institutions. If this cannot be done, the feminists want to destroy the
masculine concepts of God and Jesus. <b>Would you believe a new bible containing
scripture about "Judith Christ of Nazareth" and includes: "The
Parable of the Prodigal Daughter," and "The Lady's Prayer"?</b></p><b>
</b>
<p>I was prompted to write this article by two recent events. One was an article
in the <i>Albuquerque Journal</i>, April 29, 2007, "Remembering gay
Holocaust victims," which is an article furthering the homosexualist
project of rewriting history in this regard which has been going on for some
time. The other was an email from students and one of their instructors in a
Midwest high school, stating, "In reading your interesting presentations it
seems your objectives are to sway rather than inform." They have been
reading American Traditions Magazine articles for some time. They asked me to
comment on an article by a Jim Taylor written for the clear purpose of falsely
convincing readers that Religion, and particularly the Christian Religion,
played no important parts in the founding and the forming of this country and
its institutions. My article includes the information in my comments on the
Walker article, and I decided to try to expand it enough to shed some light on
that and related subjects.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>The Iraq War. </b>Our President continues to stand almost alone in his effort
to fight terrorism and bring the Iraq war to a successful conclusion. The
liberal media has had great success in selling to our citizens a pathway of
cowardice, doom, and failure. A recent article, <b>Defeat, Retreat Dooms U.S. to
Failure in Mideast</b>, by journalist Cal Thomas, came out in the <i>Albuquerque
Journal</i> on May 1, 2007. I would recommend reading it. It can be found at: <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><a href="http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/thomas050107.php3">http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/thomas050107.php3</a></span>.
The last paragraph of the article states: "It is shameful that so many
Democrats running for president appear ready to accept defeat and retreat if it
advances their presidential prospects, no matter the prospects for the security
of Iraq, the Middle East and the United States."</p>
<p>Now the liberals are gathering up all of the retired Generals they can find
that will help their cause, and are running ads in the media to try to hasten
our defeat, and make this country again one that its allies cannot depend on
when the going gets tough. These liberals working so hard for our defeat are not
lovers of America – they are the opposite.</p>

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left">The book, <b><i>The Temple of Karnak -- How
Rogue Judges Have Been Strangling Your&nbsp; Democracy</i></b>,
by D. J. Connolly, PH.D., has been added to the Books section. Mr. Connolly
received his Ph.D. in engineering From Case Western Reserve University in 1971.
He worked as a research engineer and in middle management at NASA's Glenn
Research Center for thirty-six years. He certainly put his research abilities to
good use in gathering the material for this book. The book is about our
imperialist judges -- particularly justices of the United States Supreme Court,
and the destruction they are doing to our Constitution. One of the many things
he gives insight to is the fiasco of the federal judges in taking over
management of a number of schools, and in forced busing trying to integrate
blacks and whites. There was never any constitutional authority for such
outrages. He covers the history of the&nbsp; federal courts from beginning to
present and outlines a continuum of misbehavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left">The eight main themes of the book are the
following:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Article
I of the federal Constitution says that only Congress has “legislative
power,” the power to pass laws. Article III says that the role of judges is
limited to deciding “cases” and “controversies.” It says nothing about
allowing judges to make new laws. Article V specifies the only legal process by
which our Constitution can be amended. In spite of these mandates, judges make
most of the really important new laws. And, ignoring Article V, they amend the
Constitution several times each year.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It’s
been half-a-century since our Supreme Court made a credible pretense of
construing the Constitution in accordance with the intent of its framers. That
gives rise to a dismaying problem. “We the People” have no say respecting
the contents of our Constitution. And those who wrote it had no say in the
matter either. Only judges have a say.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Over
the course of our history, judicial usurpation of lawmaking power has led to a
mind-boggling list of national catastrophes. Part of the list appears on the
back cover of this book.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
practice of following precedents has led to the “evolution” of a
quarter-of-a-million-page counterfeit Constitution which judges follow rather
than the real one.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our
judicial branch of government has stolen a role similar to that of ancient kings
and princes. Rogue judges gained despotic power by using methods found in
Machiavelli’s <i>The Prince</i>, the same handbook which guided Hitler,
Mussolini, and Stalin.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
flagrant violation of the First Amendment, federal courts have established a
preferred national religion, and restrict our free exercise of our own
religions.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A
gross excess of judicial power has spawned a large and perverse judicial
usurpation industry which promotes, protects, and feeds upon it.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.3in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.3in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">■<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If
our democracy isn’t dead already, it’s on life support. Outlaw judges have
corrupted other government institutions by stealing many of their most important
functions. That, in turn, is a major cause of voter apathy.</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left"> There are some points that Mr.
Connolly and I disagree on. For example, he believes that the decision written
by Chief Justice John Marshall, in <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, holding that the
Courts could strike down a statute passed by Congress, was wrong. I think it
was correct under our Constitution, because I believe that it is a binding
document on all three branches of government; and that Congress cannot override or change the Constitution anymore that the Courts can
legally do it. The Constitution can only be legally changed by the people and
their representatives, with federalist weighting by states, as provided by
Article V of the Constitution. But Mr. Connolly and I both agree that the
primary problem is rogue judges and justices that substitute their own biased
views&nbsp; for those of the people that actually formed and ratified various
provisions of our Constitution, including the Bill of Rights; and the Fourteenth
Amendment, and other Civil War amendments. I believe that if enough of the
people of this country understood the extent of this usurpation of their rights,
they would do something about it. And it could easily be cured by a simple
constitutional amendment such as the one I recommend in the article, <b>Saving
Our Constitution From Judges</b>, in the Articles section.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left">An article by Mr. D. J. Connolly, <b>Our
Secular Papacy and Gay Rights</b>, has been added to the Articles section. This
is about some particular misbehavior of judges, and particularly the liberal
United States Supreme Court Justices in striking down state laws against acts of
homosexual sodomy. This is probably the most flagrant and clear misbehavior that
was ever engaged in by certain members of the Supreme Court. It was never
intended by our founders that sodomy would be a constitutional right. When this
nation became a country, and when our Constitution and Bill of Rights were
enacted by the people and their representatives, sodomy was against the common
law of all of the states, and most of them had additional statutory provisions
against it, including some very severe penalties. When the Fourteenth Amendment
was formed and ratified, all but five of the thirty-seven states had statutory
laws against sodomy. Mr. Connolly points out that some of them even provided for
the death penalty. There was no clearer usurpation of rights of the people by
the Court than the <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i> decision striking down all sodomy
laws of the states. I explain this situation in detail in my book, <i>As We
Sodomize America</i>, except that <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i> had not been decided
when it was written. However I predicted what would happen, and the justices who
would do it, in that book, because of the erroneous decision of <i>Romer v.
Evans</i>. Our United States Supreme Court has truly been a disgrace as all true
legal scholars, and thinking people, know. It is something that should be cured,
and it easily could be, and judges and justices would still have all of the
authority and independence intended by our Founders, and the people who ratified
our Constitution and Bill of Rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left">The <b>Home Page of D. J. Connolly, Ph.D.</b>,
is being added to the Organizations section. Although, technically, this is not
an organization, it is the source&nbsp; considerable writings that are consistent with
the mission of this magazine of upholding our Constitution.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left">Another article by O. R. Adams Jr., <b>The
Immoral Religions of Atheism and Evolution</b>, has been added to the articles
section. This article explains how both Atheism and Evolution, as those ideas
are followed and promoted today, have all of the aspects true religions. Also,
considered is how they, particularly the atheists and agnostics, misconstrue
things to try to make it appear that great people in history followed their
views. A particular example given was some of the writing of the late Carl Sagan,
an astronomer.&nbsp;</p>

of the fraud of the Kinsey Institute, founded and run by Alfred C. Kinsey. The
institute, and Kinsey in particular, appears to have participated in both child
pornography and actual sexual misbehavior with small children. This institute
also cooperated with and interviewed pedophiles on their criminal sexual
misbehavior with children. The research and writings show a sordid sick mind in
regard to such things. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Many

perversions were covered in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">As We Sodomize
America </i>from other sources as well as from references to Mrs. Reisman's
research. Kinsey was also the primary basis for the fiction used by the
homosexual movement that 10% of the people were homosexual, whereas valid
research indicated the figures to be around 2% or less. Many other writings of

between Hitler and the Nazi party and the homosexuals. She refers to how the
strategies of the German homosexual movement were to ensconce National Socialism
(the Nazi party) and Adolf Hitler, triggering a holocaust which engulfed all of <st1:place>
Europe</st1:place>
. The author also goes into detail on other authorities and research that
confirm the connections between Hitler and the Nazi Party and the homosexuals,
and the key members of the Nazi Party that were homosexual. They played a major
part in installing Hitler, the policies of the Hitler regime, and the resulting
holocaust. She states that "Wilhelm Reich, warned that Nazi leadership was
both ideologically and actually homosexual." Also included, is information
indicating Hitler's own homosexual perversion. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">As

<p class="BlockSingle"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></i>The
article, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">The "Fairness Doctrine" is Unconstitutional</b>, by O. R.
Adams Jr., was added to
the articles section. Now that the
Democrats have recaptured both houses of Congress, they are planning to try
to re-enact the old "Fairness Doctrine" that previously proved not
only unworkable, but unconstitutional. Their purpose is to try to eliminate the
freedom to speak of those who oppose them. Specifically they want to eliminate
talk radio programs, such as those of Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Michael
Medved. They have also previously been trying to get a limit on the troops
overseas listening to one of their favorite programs, the Rush Limbaugh talk
show. Another pain in their side they hope to kill is Christian broadcasting,
which this would accomplish.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Giving
equal sides to opposing views would make talk radio hosts submit half of their
programs to those who do not pay for them, and whose views they oppose. And it
is not in the nature of a church sermon, to give equal sides to evil or the
devil. The left has the same opportunity to get its own programs on the airways
as others. They simply want to eliminate views that oppose them -- especially
since this opposition is so effective.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">The left has continually worked against freedom of speech
and freedom of religion under the insidious guise that they are for those very
things. Their legal hatchet men have been the ACLU. To them
speech should be politically correct – that means of course that they should
determine what speech should be used. They continually work against any semblance of
religion in schools or in the public square. The article explains how the ACLU has
worked to destroy the Boy Scouts of America, even after the United States
Supreme Court decided that they had a right to keep out homosexual scout
leaders. The ACLU tries to get schools and public places to bar the Boy Scouts
from using places that they have historically been allowed to use.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle">The ACLU teams up with the pedophile organization, North
American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), and represents it in lawsuits. The
ACLU works with them to try to get the age of consent lowered so that it will be
easier for them to prey on young boys. All of the homosexual groups are
continually working for this, and they even have an "Age of Consent"
website. The ACLU also works with them and represents them in child pornography
cases. All kinds of pornography, including child pornography, is of great
interest to these people, and the ACLU. This alone tells us volumes about their
true character. One of our present Supreme Court Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
was a former ACLU member, and perhaps still is. She has expressed similar views,
including those about lowering the age of consent, and when cases come before
the Court, she can be depended upon to hew to the ACLU line.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BlockSingle">The article explains why the so-called Fairness Doctrine
is unconstitutional. It is a violation of both freedom of speech and freedom of
religion protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. As explained in the article, it would indeed be a travesty of justice that The Supreme Court
has ruled that virtual child pornography and almost unlimited adult pornography
is protected as free speech, but that talk show hosts and religious
stations would not have the right to determine the nature of the decent things
they have on their programs. <o:p>

<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Homosexuals in the Military Service. </b>Now that the Democrats have
taken over, they are moving to change the "Don’t Ask Don't Tell"
policy of not allowing openly practicing homosexuals in the military. They want
to allow those who openly engage in sodomy in the military service, allowing
them to prey on the young men and women in the service. As soon as William
Jefferson Clinton became president, he began trying to immediately get the same
thing done, but it was strongly opposed by Congress, and they ended up with the
compromise policy now in effect.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">In a recent
interview, Marine General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of
the Military, voiced his opposition to the new push. He was of the opinion that
open homosexuality was immoral and not compatible with the military service. The
homosexual groups, with their media supporters, were outraged at this, and
called on the General for an apology. He refused to apologize for his views, but
did say that it would have been better had he just stuck to the matter of the
policy, and refrained from giving his personal moral views. I wish that he had
not backed down at all on expressing his views.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">In the book, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">As
We Sodomize America</i>, pages 71-77, I had a section, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Homosexuals
in the Military</b>, in which I gave lengthy information on that problem. Prior
to the Clinton Administration, homosexuals were barred from the military, but
many got in and were discharged when their perversion came to light. Often it
was because of homosexual assaults on young men and women in the service. Many
were prosecuted for these assaults, as well as being dishonorably discharged. As
shown by the information, many of the incidents were indeed sickening to those
who are still able to think in a sane and moral manner, after the homosexual
brainwashing we have undergone in the past thirty years. Hundreds of homosexuals
are still discharged from the military service each year, but the actual
circumstances are being kept out of the news. If the circumstances were known, I
am sure that many homosexual assaults on young men and women in the service
would again come to light.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Our society has
certainly reached a low state of moral values when it is no longer safe to state
that sodomy is wrong. Please review the part of Chapter 1 of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">As We Sodomize America</i> entitled, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Behavior which Classifies Homosexuals</b>, as to what actually
constitutes homosexual sodomy. Such acts are crimes against nature, crimes
against humanity, and until recently were crimes under the laws of all of the
States and the federal government. When a society gets to the point that it does
not consider such vile and depraved acts as immoral, it has been brainwashed
into believing that wrong is right and right is wrong. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Is that where our society is today?<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">Prior to the 1960s,
when this country began its precipitous decline in moral values, homosexual
sodomy was a crime under federal law and under the laws of every state in our
country. Sodomy is still a crime under the Code of Military Justice, although
the validity of that law is now in doubt, because of an asinine decision of the
United States Supreme Court. The reason I consider the decision asinine is
because when the United States

 became a country, sodomy was against the common law of <st1:country-region>
<st1:place>
England</st1:place>
</st1:country-region>
 and this country. When our Constitution and the Bill of Rights were formed and
ratified, sodomy was also against the statutory law of most of the states.
History shows that our founders could not have intended to make sodomy a
constitutional right. The decision was merely the personal biases of certain
liberal court members, who took it on themselves to change our Constitution to
their own personal views, which the Court has no right whatsoever to do, under
the specific provisions of our Constitution that give the right to change it
only to the people and their representatives, with federalist weighting by
states.</p>
<p class="BlockSingle" align="left" style="text-align:left">We should go back to
our military policy before the <st1:city>
<st1:place>

 administration, and bar homosexuals from being in the military at all.<o:p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">An article, <b>Cone of Evolution</b>, has also been added to
the <b>Articles</b> Section. This article explains the three major fallacies of
modern Darwinian theories of evolution. If the theories were true, that life was
accidentally formed as a one-celled amoeba and evolved to the uncountable forms
of life today in the forms from everything such as germs, bacteria, animals, and
plant life, a graph of it would be a cone – beginning from nothing to the
untold trillions of forms today. But it just hasn't happened that way. Three of
the critical contradictions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">1. During a comparatively short time in the era known as the <b>Cambrian
Explosion</b>, almost all of the animal phyla (families) appeared on earth. The
term, explosion, comes about from the suddenness of this appearance of life
forms. In fact it appears that there are fewer phyla today than there were then,
due to extinction. There is no evidence that this sudden appearance of animal
life was in any way due to evolution. Darwin himself recognized this problem,
and admitted it was unexplainable (to him).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2. With the <b>cone of evolution</b>, we would be at the top
today. With so many forms of life, in spite of the extinction of some, we should
have evidence all around us of one species changing into a new species. But it
just isn't happening. Not only that, we have had recorded history for
several thousand years now, and we have no recorded observations of any such
changes – not one. In addition, with all of the paleontological and
archeological evidence now available, there is no real evidence of any change of
one species to another species. Darwin also recognized this problem (also
unexplainable to him).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3. The third problem that cannot be explained by evolution is
<b>why humans are the only living things that have developed complex thinking</b>
to where they can consider and solve many problems such as these relating to evolution. They paint
pictures, compose music, read, write, invent things such as cars, boats,
airplanes, computers and various other such things; but they are not the oldest
animals. Yet they are the only species that has done any of these things. This
cannot be explained by evolutionists.</p>

</b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>January and February were not good months for our country</b>.
The Democrats have taken over both houses of Congress, and they and the liberal
media sound a steady and loud drumbeat for our defeat and withdrawal from Iraq.
The liberals and other gullible members of the public soak it up and regurgitate
it. Has America completely lost its backbone. People of this kind would have
sounded our defeat after our first battle in Europe in World War II. See the
information below, or in the Archives, under <b>February</b>, for the casualties in just one battle
in World War II. We lost a great number more men in the Battle of Normandy than
we have lost in four years in the Iraq war. Consider just the first day of that
battle: "Total Allied casualties on D-Day [June 6, 1944] are estimated at
10,000, including 2500 dead. British casualties on D-Day have been estimated at
approximately 2700. The Canadians lost 946 casualties. The US forces lost 6603
men. Note that the casualty figures for smaller units do not always add up to
equal these overall figures exactly, however (this simply reflects the problems
of obtaining accurate casualty statistics)."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm#casualities">http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm#casualities</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our President and his administration stand almost alone in
the fight. We have not yet been able to shake our Vietnam Syndrome of defeatism.
We are once again called upon by the liberals to cowardly forsake an ally, and
leave them to slaughter.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The peaceniks are on the streets protesting again, with the
Vietnam traitor, Jane Fonda, in their forefront once more – just like the old
Vietnam days. It seems that the liberals and their cowardly attitudes never
change. Unfortunately for the country, many of the peaceniks, hippies, flower
children, and druggies went on to become journalists, teachers and professors,
and Democrat congressmen and senators. One, William Jefferson Clinton, even
became President.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are a lot of liberals in this country that have no real
love and respect for this country and its institutions. They particularly hate
our Christian heritage. They have never wanted this country to be the major
superpower in the world. They have continually fought against us even having
anti-ballistic missile systems to defend our country. Many want us to
unilaterally do away with our nuclear weapons – anything to weaken this
country and destroy our military capability; and even more importantly to them,
destroy its traditional institutions. When they bring about another shameful
defeat in Iraq, we will certainly be reduced to less than the superpower of the
world. No country will be able to again have any confidence in this country as
an ally. It is truly a shameful thing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the book, <i>As We Sodomize America</i>, I explain in
detail the liberal effort to undermine the Judeo-Christian values that have been
basic to this country and its traditions. They brainwash our school children
with everything from the acceptance of homosexuality and the acceptance of
homosexual marriage to the undermining of our Constitution and denigrating our
Founders and American history. They want to revise even the history of this
country to tear down its greatness and accomplishments. They even want to revise
our dictionaries and our speech, and even the Bible, to their ideas of
"political correctness." They truly want to destroy every worthwhile
thing in and about our country, from our Constitution, our free enterprise
system, our Christian heritage, to our Christian morality. The success of these
leftist ventures has been astounding. When the liberals capture both the media
and academia, the gullible and the ignorant fall for their propaganda in droves.
<b>The real danger to this country is not from abroad – it is from the
liberals right here at home.</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<b>Freedom of Speech. </b>Liberals often talk about freedom of speech, when in
truth the only speech they want allowed is that which is "politically
correct" and and is designed, dictated, and limited by them. The
continually fight for allowing pornography and all kinds of indecent material in
the media and on the airways, but not free speech on religion, Christianity, or
conservative politics.&nbsp; The approach is the same in our colleges and
universities, and even in public schools, where liberal "political
correctness" is dictated;&nbsp; even in science, where criticisms of
Darwinian theory are limited, and discussion and material on intelligent design
in nature is barred. Now that the Democrats are in charge in Congress&nbsp; they
want to re-enact the old discarded and unconstitutional "Fairness
Doctrine." The object of this is to eliminate conservative talk radio,
Christian broadcasting, and anything else adverse to leftist philosophy and
politics.&nbsp; They are not satisfied that they have the media, generally, and
academia in their left pocket -- they want to stifle all opposition. A full article
on this is planned for the April issue.</p>
<b>
</b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Venezuela</b>. The news at the end of January reported that
the legislative body of that country just gave Hugo Chavez, President, the power
he wanted to rule by decree. We now have a socialist dictator in this important
South American country. This will probably further increase our oil problems.
This is a good example of how socialism works toward taking away the basic
rights of freedom and property ownership from the people, and to a dictatorship.
They lose the most important right of good government, which is a government of
the people, by the people and for the people.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">An article, <b>Our Children Reflect Our

Bowl" in the 1930's in the area where I grew up.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">I believe that there is nothing more
telling about a society than its children. They reflect the influences of their
parents and of their schools.&nbsp; They also reflect a number of other
influences, especially today. They have great exposure to the media, in the form
of television, and the use many of them make of computers. They are also
influenced by their friends, and what "others are doing." Even the
stores pray on them and influence them to buy the latest kinds of clothes, and
even shoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Today, a parent who wants to bring a
child up in a Christian atmosphere has many great problems to overcome -- not
the least of which is the bad influence today of many of our public schools.
These are also among the things that were covered at length in the book, <i>As
We Sodomize America.</i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Radical Islam. </b>Today,&nbsp; our
country and the Judaeo-Christian world are engaged in a life and death struggle
with radical Islam. Our service men and women are fighting such elements in Iraq
and Afghanistan, and we have been attacked several times in various countries
and in this country. Where radical Islam is in control, the
"nonbelievers" are persecuted and murdered. Our president and congress
must struggle with the problem continually.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">There is a real argument as to whether
or not Christianity and Islam can actually be peacefully reconciled, because of
some of the violent passages in the Quran, the bible of the religion. It is
certainly a large problem that is difficult to solve, but it is one that we will
be struggling with for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">An interesting article was in <i>World</i>
magazine, January 13, 2007, <b>a question of linkage</b>, on Islam. It is a
discussion between <i>Enemy at Home</i> author, Dinesh D'Souza, and Marvin
Olasky of <i>World</i> and author of <i>The Religion Next Door. </i>The two
authors debate on whether or not there can be any reasonable reconciliation
between Christianity and Islam. Olasky points out some basic problems of
Islam, and the Quran, when it comes to any kind of peaceful reconciliation
between the two religions. He cites passages in the Quran that expressly support
violence against nonbelievers. One was "kill the unbelievers wherever you
find them." (Chapter 9, Verse 5) D'Souza points out some possible ways of a peaceful
reconciliation, but some of his ideas do not seem to be much of a
reconciliation, primarily because of the requirement of Islamic control of
governments themselves. Olasky also points out that the violent past history of
Islam is not at all encouraging.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10"><b>A word about researching the Koran. </b>The
Islamic bible goes by several names, some of which I have found are Quiran,
Quir'an, Qur'ân, and Koran. There are a number of interpretations, and some of
them use somewhat different words for similar things. I have researched a hard
copy I have in my library, and several online versions, which are easy to
find.&nbsp; For example, note the verse above about "kill the
unbelievers." I have found several versions that have verses with
substantially the same meaning as the above, but in place of unbelievers some
have used polytheists, pagans, and idolaters. Fortunately, it does seem that the
numbers for chapters and verses&nbsp; pretty well coincide.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">The many things in the Koran that are
similar to the above verse on the treatment of those who will not convert to
Islam, and Islamic control of government, point up the great problems of any
real reconciliation between the two religions. Whether or not Islamic countries
can be persuaded to live in peace with the "unbelievers", and allow
reasonable freedom of religion within their countries, remains to be seen. It
well may be that in this regard, President Bush and his advisers have been over
optimistic. But I certainly agree that we must try.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">A book I recommend on the problems
between Islam and Christianity is <i>Unveiling
Islam, </i>by Ergun Mehmet Caner and Emir Fethi Caner, two Muslim brothers who
converted from Islam to Christianity. Because of the conversion, their lives
would now be in danger in Muslim countries around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">No Islamic country, at present, allows any real
freedom of religion as we have in this country and other western countries.
Whether or not this can be changed, and to what extent, we are in the process of
learning.&nbsp; Our experiments in Iraq
and Afghanistan, and fighting terrorism there, will eventually give us much more insight into the
problem.&nbsp;Particularly if the media and Democrat push of the "Vietnam
Syndrome" in an effort to bring about our defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan is
not successful. Further remarks about this effort of the media are made in the
article, <b>Our Children Reflect Our Culture.</b></p>
<p>What has happened to our American backbone and courage
during our liberal onslaught in the past fifty years? In the four years since
our last invasion of Iraq, in all of the fighting, we have lost just over 3000 men and women. Consider
the following, as to what the allies and the United States lost in just one battle in World War II:</p>
<p class="Indent1" style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; margin-left: 50; margin-right: 50">Over
425,000 Allied and German troops were killed, wounded or went missing during the
Battle of Normandy. This figure includes over 209,000 Allied casualties, with
nearly 37,000 dead amongst the ground forces and a further 16,714 deaths amongst
the Allied air forces. Of the Allied casualties, 83,045 were from 21st Army
Group (British, Canadian and Polish ground forces), 125,847 from the <st1:country-region>
<st1:place>
US</st1:place>
</st1:country-region>
 ground forces. The losses of the German forces during the Battle of Normandy
can only be estimated. Roughly 200,000 German troops were killed or wounded. The
Allies also captured 200,000 prisoners of war (not included in the 425,000
total, above). During the fighting around the Falaise Pocket (August 1944)
alone, the Germans suffered losses of around 90,000, including prisoners. (<a href="http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm">http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm</a>)</p>
<p>Certainly, every life is precious, but we need to shake
our Vietnam Syndrome and regain some of the national will and courage that made
this a great country for so long in our history. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">If our war on terror results in any
benefit and future protection to this country it will be primarily because of
the determination of our President, George W. Bush, and our valiant troops
fighting under his command. Liberals here at home have opposed him and tried to
undercut him and our country every step of the way, from our efforts abroad, to
our security here at home. The drum beat of the liberal media has been
incessant. And those who have stood with our beleaguered President crumble and
fall, one by one, against this onslaught here at home. Our enemies abroad do not
have the power to defeat us -- the ones here at home are much more effective.
The same thing brought about our disgraceful withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10"><b>National Rifle Association. </b>Some
may wonder why this organization is included. It has continually supported our
Constitution, and particularly our right to bear arms under the Second

America;&nbsp; and the Founders and founding of the Constitution of the United
States. So far I have in my library forty-five of those fine books, and have
read forty-four of them. This organization was formed in 1871, and has supported
marksmanship and firearms safety since its inception. It has cooperated with the
federal government on marksmanship and national rifle match programs. It
sponsors pistol and rifle match competition around the country. I joined the
organization in 1949 when I was doing match shooting with the Dallas Pistol and
Revolver Club, and have been a member ever since.&nbsp; Back then it was not a
controversial organization. It only became controversial to the liberal element
of our society when they began trying to do away with our right to bear arms,
and the NRA has vigorously defended that right.</p>

continually under attack all over the world. In radical Muslim areas, Christians
are persecuted and murdered. They are still persecuted in communist countries.
In our own country, freedom of religion is protected by our Constitution. But
Christians are nevertheless persecuted and their ideas stifled in our schools and
universities.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">&nbsp;Organizations like the Boy Scouts
of America spend untold thousands of dollars, now probably in the millions, protecting themselves in lawsuits
brought by the organization with the misnomer, American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), merely because they expressly believe in God, and try to prevent
homosexuals from becoming scoutmasters. Over the years, the Boy Scouts continually had the problem of homosexuals infiltrating it, becoming leaders or
scoutmasters, and sexually abusing young boy scouts. This is also covered in
detail in <i>As We Sodomize America,</i> as is the same kind of problems the
Catholic Church has had for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">The ACLU and its atheists are
continually bringing lawsuits in an attempt to remove any semblance of religion
or Christianity from our schools, public squares and buildings, which are not
privately owned. This is completely contrary to the views of our founders and to

the Species</i>, by Charles Darwin, first published in 1859. This book may later
be made available on this website, although it is easily available on the
internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Darwinian evolution is now taught in our
schools as proved facts, when in truth none of its basic tenets have been
proved, and in my opinion cannot be proved. The Discovery Institute is a
scientific think-tank, and its scientists, researchers and writers have devoted
a lot of time and work to this subject. More information on this organization
will be found on the Organizations&nbsp; page of this website, which lists other
organizations which support one or more of the principles to which this magazine
is devoted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Evolutionists in our schools and
universities vigorously fight any attempt to include any curriculum or
discussion on intelligent design in nature. However some of the most renowned
evolutionists have had to admit the basic facts supporting intelligent design,
but try to get around it by saying that it is merely an "appearance"
of intelligent design. Why -- because they know it is the death knell for
Darwinian evolution. But science cannot forever ignore that which is obvious,
and eventually it will be accepted. <b> All that is required is that real scholars
open their eyes and their minds at the same time.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">As explained in the article, "The
Bases of Mathematics are Intelligently Designed," available in the Articles
page,
such diverse but brilliant thinkers as Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein have
long recognized Intelligent Design in nature; yet the evolutionists in our
schools fight the very mention of it in a class where evolution is taught. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">There are a number of books and articles
on Intelligent design, but some of them by biologists and scientists often get
quite complicated. We are presenting&nbsp; some papers in the Articles page that are
clear, simple, and on subjects that most anyone can easily
understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Homosexual
Agenda </b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">The book, <i>As We Sodomize America</i>,
was referred to above. We consider it the most complete book available on the
combined subjects of the book, and it is probably the most complete book
available on just the combined subjects of homosexuality and the homosexual
movement. It also has information on the causes of and cures for homosexuality.
It graphically covers what homosexuality actually is, and therefore is not a
book for children.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">&nbsp;The article, Modern Use of the Term, "Latent&nbsp; Homosexuality," is on this particular tool used by homosexual
activists and their supporters to try to squelch criticism of sodomy. See
Articles.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Our
Constitution</b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Destruction of our Constitution by
activist judges, particularly liberal justices in the United States Supreme
Court, is covered in some detail in <i>As We Sodomize America</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Adams has also written a book, <i>A Way
to Save Our Constitution From Judges</i>, which is under consideration by hard copy
publishers. Later, either the book or information about it will be made
available in this magazine. An article, <b>Saving Our Constitution From Judges</b>,
is presented on this subject with a
copy of the simple constitutional amendment advocated to easily cure this problem
with judges, and still leave them with their full freedom and independence
intended by our Founders.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">A copy of the Declaration of
Independence, with the names of the signers and their respective occupations,
and our Constitution, is available under BOOKS.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Also, a short article, "Powers of
the President," is included in ARTICLES, with more comprehensive references
on this currently controversial subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Traditional
American Values </b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 10">Because of the interconnection between
the subjects, there is little left to say on traditional values, other than the
above, at this time. There are a number of other good organizations fighting to
preserve these values, and some will be listed under organizations. They are all
worthy of support. </p>
