        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
shows you to be a strong individual with an even stronger and
determined drive to achieve your ends. You can be very dedicated in
your efforts to further important personal ambitions. The congenial,
peaceable, and placid attributes of the bull (Taurus) are sure to be
present, but Aries provides an emotional stimulation that makes you
much more assertive that most Taurus natives. You have a sparkling
enthusiasm which keeps you on the move asserting your natural
leadership traits. While involved in an issue, your mind is actively
and restlessly searching for loopholes, weak points, or contradictions.
When you find an inconsistency in logic or in the facts, your quickness
to judge comes into play and you form a definite opinion on the matter
in seconds. If you later discover a contradiction to this argument, you
may just as rapidly drop your position and with equal rigidity, hold to
the opposite view. There are great inconsistencies in your nature, much
more that you may realize or admit. You can be tolerant and
broad-minded in your viewpoints one minute, and totally biased and
unreasonable the next. Even when you aren't insisting on something, you
have a way of making your wishes known by a manner, a gesture, or a
lack of enthusiasm that clearly states your position. When you are
directly arguing a point, you have a way of being so plausible and
apparently reasonable that you wear down resistance. You have a way of
eliminating opposition by the shear strength of your will. The traits
of this configuration are ones that demand harnessing and controlling.
If this is accomplished, there is little that you cannot accomplish.
Generally, your ability to interact with people will be difficult, and
your greatest achievements will be realized by directing your efforts
toward impersonal activities. </dt>

        <dt><a name="2-2"></a><b>2-2
Taurus/</b><a name="Taurus"></a><b>Taurus</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
amplifies the determination and purposeful nature of this sign of the
Bull. Your concentration and staying power is second to none.
Concentration is the base of your renowned tendency toward
stubbornness, in that when you apply your mind to a subject, nothing is
likely to distract your attention. Accordingly, you can focus with
equal tenacity on your work, your domestic life, and your leisure
activities. You are never one to jump to conclusions, but once you have
made up your mind, you are never likely to modify your views. You are
highly conventional, and you have a great regard for the establishment
and the status quo. Change is something you prefer to avoid because you
are slow to adjust and dislike being required to do so. You make a good
friend because you are honest and loyal. You enjoy good friends, good
food, good music, and in general, the "good life." You are
materialistic, but with a special knack for saving and reinvesting. You
are always a hard worker, and you don't mind starting at the bottom and
slowly working your way to the top. You can achieve success because the
work you do is done well and you are totally dependable. Patient and
calm, your "tongue in cheek" diplomacy designed to humor opponents
until, in the end, you have your own way. You respect authority simply
because you expect someday to have it. </dt>


        <dt>&nbsp; </dt>


        <dt><a name="2-3"></a><b>2-3
Taurus/</b><a name="Gemini"></a><b>Gemini</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
gives an affinity for sociability, and a definite air of simple
pleasantness marks your personality. The contrasting elements of
slowness of Taurus and speed of Gemini generally produces a Taurus
person more apt to make errors of judgment. The natural trait of
stubbornness may still be present, but the Gemini Moon often shows a
tendency to jump rather quickly to conclusions and the natural Taurus
fixity is not nearly so apparent. But sometimes trouble can arise when
you form a quick opinion and do hold to it, no matter what. You are
mentally alert, but apt to lack the great memory usually possessed by
Taurus natives. There is an ever present tendency with this pairing to
be too critical of other people. This is the most restless and fickle
of the Taurus combinations. You may find yourself constantly jumping
into friendships and romances, finding reasons why the other person is
not right for you. Continuous challenge and stimulation is required to
keep your undivided attention. You need more education that most people
because study and learning steadies your nature. Your capacity for
attainment increases in direct ratio with your interest in study and
education. Fortunately, your intellectual tendencies probably endow you
with good abilities or talents. You're apt to show especially good
verbal skills; speaking and writing. With education you can be less
restless and more contented. The mind is always needing something
tangible and concrete with which to relate. Keeping yourself mentally
busy is very important for you. </dt>

Taurus/</b><a name="Cancer"></a><b>Cancer</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
is somewhat contradictory and confusing. The Moon placement suggests
you are sensitive, easily hurt, and sometimes very resentful. The Sun,
conversely, shows that you are not one to be pushed around easily, and
at times you can be down right stubborn. Usually you hide your dislikes
very well and rely on diplomacy, making it a little unclear to others
exactly where you stand or what you are thinking. You have a way of
changing your tactics to suit your purposes, and to avoid conflict. In
business you are a shrewd tactical planner who can come up with the
right strategy, often influenced more by feelings than reason. Yours is
a rather sensitive nature, endowed with an emotional side that can
easily be aroused. Your foundation and the stabilizing factor in your
life is in the home and with the family. Self-assurance, that may seem
strong in your nature, is really only skin deep. Your capacity for
conciliating different views is noteworthy, but it can seem that you
have no real conviction of your own sometimes. This is not usually the
case however. There is a tendency for you to hide your light under the
lamp shade when you need to be making decisions and taking firm
actions. You need not be such a pushover because your ideas are very
sound and well constructed. Your ambitions are strong and you never
give up on a job. Yet there is a tendency to be a little negative and
pessimistic when things don't go the way you think they should. </dt>


        <dt>&nbsp; </dt>


        <dt><a name="2-5"></a><b>2-5
Taurus/</b><a name="Leo"></a><b>Leo</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
produces a strong determined will, well defined opinions, and a very
forthright, honest, and fearless personality. There is much pride tied
up in your nature. You respect others, but you listen to yourself and
trust your personal abilities first and foremost. Not tending to rely
on your intellect alone, you depend more on your hunches, and your key
to success should be your high self-esteem. Creativity and pragmatism
mark your nature, giving you an excellent sense of how things should be
constructed, organized, or planned. You are a good manager or boss, and
people respond well to working for you. At your best you are
persistent, sure and reliable. Personal confidence and pride can at
times cause you to be domineering and inflexible in attitude, and you
possess strong likes and dislikes. Because you are usually so steady
and consistent, you rarely blow up. You can be critical, but in a fair
and constructive way. Wanting things done your way, you don't like to
have your action very closely monitored or scrutinized, although you
are not above doing this to others. Too your few close friends, you are
trustworthy, honest, and devoted. You seem to like or dislike people
because of instinctive feelings about them rather than for matters you
have reasoned out. This is a very fixed and stable personality, but in
the early part of your life you probably had tendencies toward
extremes. Throughout your life it will always be important for you to
double check decisions and avoid overestimating possibilities because
of confidence or pride. Behind the spirited, but pridefully impulsive
qualities in your personality is a practical, solid, determined
internal nature that serves you much better. </dt>


        <dt>&nbsp; </dt>


        <dt><a name="2-6"></a><b>2-6
Taurus/</b><a name="Virgo"></a><b>Virgo</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
produces charm, poise, balance and a good deal of common sense. Unless
the Sun or the Moon has some difficult aspects to contend with, you
will glide through life with few problems, because of the pragmatic and
stable physical characteristics of Taurus blended with the cool
intellect of Virgo. You have much to offer the world, but someone may
have to spur you into action. Once the inertia of getting started is
overcome, you can throw yourself into work with the greatest energy if
you so desire. You may be prone to complain about the way life is
treating you, but without some of these minor irritations, you would
coast along and let someone else shoulder the responsibility. A little
adversity is good for you and wakes you up so that you can become very
conscientious on the job. You have an innate ability, if left to your
own devices, of slipping by with the expenditure of very little energy;
living by your wits and your practical nature. When you apply yourself,
results can be amazing. A natural student, your mind is quick and
retentive. You love to read, and you can grasp and retain material that
other may often overlook. Though you are stubborn and don't like to be
told what to do, you are inclined to end up in a subordinate role
simply because you aren't very aggressive at grabbing the reins of
control and responsibility. You have charisma and magnetism combined
with the ability to see people for what they are. These characteristics
are what makes life easy for you and allows you to become very much the
opportunist who takes advantage of charm, common sense and innate
abilities to produce a comfortable lifestyle. </dt>

Taurus/</b><a name="Libra"></a><b>Libra</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
produces one of the most likable personalities in the Zodiac. Others
may have more wit, ambition, or intellect, but none equal the charm and
appeal of this combination. A nice home and a close family are your
first loves; social contact and involvement, a close second. Your keen
social personality is aided by a fine sense of humor and an easygoing
outlook. This personality is marked with optimism, even if you're up to
your ears in private woes. Anyone that doesn't like you is probably
motivated by jealousy. You are expressive and idealistic, your nature
is inclined toward the dramatic and the artistic. Though your positive
attitude allows you to accomplish a great deal when you settle down to
work, when forced to face the world of fact and figures and engage in
anything that restricts your creative talents, you can never really be
happy. You can never handle conflict matters very well as you suffer
from nervous tension when placed in a confrontation situation or
hostility of any kind. Your great sense of balance and harmony
constantly protects you from ever go off the deep end. You may have a
wide range of emotional responses from rapturous joy when you are
happily with a special someone in a solid relationship, to almost going
to pieces when you are confronted by hostility and forced to react to
it. </dt>

        <dt><a name="2-8"></a><b>2-8
Taurus/</b><a name="Scorpio"></a><b>Scorpio</b>
        </dt>


        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
produces a personality possessing a good deal more emotional intensity
that is normally observed in the very stable Taurus Sun sign native. A
very attractive cover hides the emotionally temperamental side of your
nature. There is a very "definite" quality about you that insists black
is black and white is white, and the many shades of gray don't exist.
You have a very strong and passionate nature that knows what it wants
and how to get it. You are very headstrong, self-willed, and
independent. Your charm is instantaneous, and this coupled with your
dramatic flare, shows talent for acting and speaking. You like being
noticed and there is nothing at all timid about you. You are very
appealing to the opposite sex, but the temperament you release when
your reserve breaks down can make personal relationships very stormy.
With all the tools that you have to get ahead, it wouldn't be hard for
you to go far. Strangely however, your ambition to do so may not be as
strong as many of your competitor who you pass along the way may
believe. The tension that seems always to be building up constantly
produces the urge to get away from it all and let yourself completely
relax. You need this reprieve to avoid the stress to which you are
rather susceptible. </dt>

        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and Moon sign blend
two signs that are both extroverted and sociable, and enjoy having a
good time. Your sense of what constitutes a good time is variable;
sometimes simple and earthy, and other times much more venturesome.
Your highly developed social sense suggests that you like people, but
they must be the right people. You would rather be alone than confined
with people that you consider dull or uninteresting. This is not to say
you are necessarily class conscious, for you can get along with all
types of people with your ability to say the right thing at the right
time. Your manner of speaking is, however, forthright and direct and
you have no difficulty making your sincerity and decisiveness felt.
Your stubborn nature can express itself in such a flexible way that you
can discuss a subject at great length without wavering from your
original position. A tendency to stick by your very high principles and
code make you come across as a moralist and one not above sitting in
judgment of friend and acquaintances. You feel you have a right to this
as you are a pretty good, law abiding, conventional human being. Talk
is a specialty of yours, especially when the talk can take on a
personal touch. You always enjoy exchanging tidbits of gossip and
passing on rumors. You try to like a good life; full and satisfying in
an intellectual sense, but pleasant and luxurious all the same. </dt>

        <dt>The combination of your Sun and Moon signs produces a
personality that is gentle and easygoing, unless some way provoked.
When you are asked to do something against your will, the nature of
both signs is to resist with a great stubbornness. Your makeup is very
strong and durable emotionally. You can handle much stress and stain in
your life and always emerge from a crisis in good shape. You are stable
and decisive, and there is little that is frivolous or whimsical about
you. You don't waste time daydreaming because you are just too
practical. You may spend a good deal of time planning or putting things
together, but you prefer to deal in tangible, matter-of-fact affairs
that lend themselves well to your close scrutiny and critical analysis.
You are a dependable person to whom others bring problems or projects
and count on for help. You actually enjoy a sense of responsibility,
perhaps even more than the recognition or power that usually
accompanies authority. Security is of the utmost importance to you. You
don't necessarily want wealth, but security of home, of position, and
of a degree of prestige are all important. You are a proud person, with
a strong sense of your own worth, which you like to see manifest in the
material things in your world . . .your accomplishments or your
surroundings. You have much executive talent because of your
down-to-earth way of approaching problems and you keen understanding of
human nature. You have an instinct for knowing what people are thinking
and what they will be thinking in a little while. </dt>

        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
produces an affable personality and an easy, friendly manner that makes
it easy for you to meet and deal with strangers. You know instinctively
how to get along with people. This conceals a core of hard purpose and
solid convictions. Your charming manner and pleasant demeanor draws
others to you like a magnet, and you can achieve your ends with
diplomacy and friendly persuasion. You are, likewise, very tolerant of
people and always very interested in them, albeit in a rather detached
way. Sometimes you are even too quick to trust the untrustworthy,
because you are so prone to have an initial sense of faith in others.
Few can live up to your code of treating other people as you would like
to have them treat you. Your major motivating power or personal drive
stems from your deep feelings. You can feel deeply about things, yet
because of an impersonal quality in your external personality, you are
seldom likely to go overboard because of emotional pressures. You know
how to control and wisely direct your feelings making them work for you
in human relationships. You have an excellent, very studious mind,
curious and inventive. You have an innate ability to work well with
colors and forms and may have a good deal of artistic talent. You do
not ask for much in a material sense, and thus, you may not achieve a
great deal in this regard. Strangely, inertia can be your only enemy.
You possess a good deal of self-esteem that will aid you in attaining
much in life. Though shrewd in business, your honor never deserts you.
Your friendliness and ability to put people at ease can prove to be
your greatest asset for success and attainment. </dt>

        <dt>The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign
produces much creativity and imagination, but at the same time it
creates a somewhat private dream life that may not have a firm grip on
reality. Taurus gives you a restful or stable internal nature, but the
Moon gives a rather changeable personality. Despite a need and desire
for sympathy and affection, you may isolate yourself from others and
maintain strong powers of restraint in relating your feelings. You are
highly sensitive to emotional matters, impressionable to love and
flattery. You are somewhat susceptible to being imposed upon by friends
and associates. Insights to people are continuous being formed and
evaluated and the conclusions formed are generally accurate. It is
important that you exercise discrimination in selecting your friends.
The passive inclinations in your nature makes you inclined to attract
imposition by others playing on your good nature and kind disposition.
You take life seriously, but view things that are going on around you
as though you were not part of the picture, and it is somewhat easy for
you to lose sight of reality. You can be extremely amiable when you
permit yourself to respond to people in a spontaneous and natural
manner. Because of this, you are a natural for romance that is always
strong in your nature. You have a stubborn streak that can be a
protective device and helpful, if you don't let it become too powerful
in your personality. A tendency toward overindulgence can cause you
some problems at times; too much worry, food, sex, pleasure-seeking.
Avoid brooding and feeling sorry for yourself. You do much better when
you open up to people and keep yourself on a positive track. </dt>
