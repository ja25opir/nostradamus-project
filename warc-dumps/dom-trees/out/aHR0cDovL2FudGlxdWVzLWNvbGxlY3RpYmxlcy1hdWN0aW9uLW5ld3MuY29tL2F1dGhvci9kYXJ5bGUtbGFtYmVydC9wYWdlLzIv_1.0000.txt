John Wall – Thank s to feeds.washingtonpost.com</p>
<p>I have heard all the hype but had not seen John Wall in a Kentucky uniform until last night. Hopefully, I won’t miss another game all season when Kentucky is on television. Yes I am a Kentucky fan and have seen players come and go, but if you don’t see Wall play this college season, you will have missed something. The reason I say this is because I don’t think he will have more than one year of college basketball before he goes pro. It is my understanding that John Wall is already the top prospect for the pro draft next year. When even Dick Vitale gets excited about a SEC player, you know he is the real deal.</p>
<p>I have seem Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Lebron James play and I wasn’t sure that I would have the opportunity to see another player with the potential to be as great as them, but last night I just may have seen the next superstar. Players of the caliber of the aforementioned only come around on rare occasions so you must enjoy them while they’re playing. Wall just seems to demand the ball when the game is on the line and already this year in the first nine games for Kentucky, his absolute will to win has pulled the Wildcats out of the fire.</p>
<p>John Wall started the night like a house on fire but only played nine minutes of the first half. It wasn’t until they had lost the 12 point lead and had dug themselves into an 8 point deficit in the second half that Wall decided that it was his time and his game. He made 12 of the last 15 points for Kentucky and when he went to the foul line it was as if he had ice in his veins as he nailed every shot.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you a play that Wall made that might be beyond description. Wall took the ball at the head of the lane, passed it to another player, circled around that player, received a return pass, dribbled toward the basket where he was confronted by three of the Connecticut big men, leaped between them and shot the ball while he was falling and made the basket, plus got fouled and made the next point. The only plays that I can remember that even come close to what I saw were some of the shots Michael Jordan made in his career.</p>
<p>This blog might seem strange to you but it shouldn’t be because I am encouraging you to search out any item that John Wall has touched in the few years he has played basketball. I don’t even know where he attended high school but it would be well worth it to own one of his school jerseys. As this college season progresses, I believe that I won’t be the only one saying this is the birth of a superstar and if you can find items of his they should prove to be quite profitable for you. Also on occasion, I might even set an item or two back for a rainy day. If you start now to look for John Wall items, I guarantee that you will be way ahead of the pack and this should prove to be to your advantage.</p>
<p>There are already 30 items on eBay featuring Wall and we should be buying every one of them. If you look at Bird, Jordan or James jerseys, they are already selling in the thousands and I say watch out and move over because there is a new sheriff in town, John Wall.</p>

<h4>Tiger Woods – Daryle Lambert’s Antique and Collectibles Blog – How could I not?</h4>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/Sx5Ousff1hI/AAAAAAAACfs/Nbpx7DWh3cY/s1600-h/8bb25e9ac7734a1c%5B1%5D.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/Sx5Ousff1hI/AAAAAAAACfs/Nbpx7DWh3cY/s400/8bb25e9ac7734a1c%5B1%5D.jpg" border="0"></a> Tiger Woods – Thanks to Golf-Leader.com</p>
<p>Before the election, I wrote about my views on our not yet President, Barack Obama. If you remember, I stated that he was a very smart man but I disagreed with almost everything he stood for. I have to say that today I am even more convinced than ever that he is leading us into a disaster. Still, I will tell you that his memorabilia in the future will be worth more than any president in my lifetime. Take this opportunity to capitalize on this, the first black president in the history of this country, by searching out the best of the best of the Obama collectibles and you will find a willing collector to buy them from you</p>
<p>Now I have to share another equally important opportunity for you to take advantage of: Tiger Woods collectibles. Tiger has almost single handedly removed every other newsworthy item from the press. I have to make a joke here, however, because if you wish to buy one of his clubs, be sure to check that it isn’t damaged. It is a shame that a person of his stature in the sporting world would allow himself to be dragged through the mud like this, but the tabloids will make him even more famous than before.</p>
<p>Look at Babe Ruth and what a scoundrel he was. Even Billy Clinton is better known for his escapades than he was of being president. People that get the most press seem to endure the test of time and I believe that Tiger Woods will certainly fit that bill. He won’t be remembered by the beautiful wife and two children she bore him but by the gutter trash that he couldn’t resist. However society seems to thrive on such garbage and this won’t be the exception to that rule</p>
<p>So take advantage of this opportunity to buy anything associated with Tiger Woods, like clubs, signed hats, photographs with his signature, shoes, bags, signed score cards and any other item that can be directly linked to Tiger. I will mention a few and there are many others with prices exceeding $20,000 and I think that their prices will go straight up from here.</p>
<p>How about an Upper Deck Legends of Sports photo with the signatures of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordon and Ali on it? There were just 500 made and one just sold for $4500 which will prove to be cheap. Perhaps the most plentiful collectible with Tiger’s signature on them may be tournament flags and one with 24 champions like Tiger, Nicklaus, Palmer, Nickelson, Player and others sold for $3000.</p>
<p>Here is a rare item for you: a baseball signed by Tiger at the Atlanta Braves training camp on March 3, 1999 sold for $2227. There are others but I think you get the idea that anything Tiger will be expensive in the future, so find it now.</p>
<p>I would like for all of us to pray for Tiger that some way he will make amends to his family for the unkept promises that he made to God and his wife. The skills that he received did not come from him but God. Amen</p>

<p>I have been saying that “Collector Plates” were the worst buy out there for the last 20 years and I put them on my don’t buy list for the last two. I have been right all this time but now this may be changing.</p>
<p>Over the last few years at house and garage sales, I have seen groups of 25 to 50 plates sell for one dollar or less apiece. I had no interest in reselling these for two dollars each because I thought my time was worth more than what it would take to box and ship them. Even at the Direct Auction sales which I attend, I have seen as many as 20 plates go unsold because they didn’t even reach the $20 minimum.</p>
<p>The lack of interest in “Collector Plates” might be changing and I will give you the reason why. With money tight and expensive collectibles out of the reach of so many people today, there still is a fever to collect in most people. Another reason that people might be buying plates is that they can give a gift of a plate that originally cost several hundred dollars and only invest a few dollars in it. If you are a collector today, you can put together a fairly large collection of plates that cost the first buyers thousands of dollars for just a few hundred. Who hasn’t seem Hummel or Bing and Grondahl plates hanging on a friend’s or parent’s wall?</p>
<p>I tell the story in my book “31 Steps to Your Millions in Antiques and Collectibles” about the twelve Royal Worcester plates that I bought for $400 that cost the original buyer $3600 (so how could I go wrong, right?) Well, I kept those plates and carried them around to two other houses I moved to over a ten year period and finally sold them at auction here in Chicago for $300. I have to laugh because I told myself at least I didn’t lose as much as the first buyer. I believe that I would be more than glad to purchase them back today for what I sold them.</p>
<p>You, in your search, could very easily run across someone who has inherited a plate collection that can be bought for a few dollars. It may be the right decision for you to buy them. I have to admit that I have had numerous people ask me what to do with the collection of plates they inherited and my pat answer has always been to get whatever you can for them. But this is a different time and I believe that now, with the prices where they are for plates, it might be a good time to change our direction when it comes to this collectible.</p>
<p>Here are just a few names of companies that produced plates that you might be well advised to pick up: Bing and Grondahl, Lenox and Wedgwood and I am sure that there are others. I will just give you a quick list of plates that have sold on eBay; there are others that didn’t sell but their asking prices were from $500 to well over $1000. Here’s the list: Bing and Grondahl 1902 plate – $375, Hummel 9 plates $350, Hamilton Wizard of Oz plates[8] – $300, Lenox 1993 Christmas plate – $175, I love Lucy plate – $150, Lenox 1994 Christmas plate – $149, Wedgwood Sugaring plate – $127.50, Nancy Ward Christmas plate – $125 and one last one, Danbury Boston Terrier plate – $89.</p>
<p>If any of the above plates had been purchased for a couple of dollars or less, they could help you to a Merry Christmas.</p>
<p align="left">I hope that in the future we will be able to receive comments on the blog but that doesn’t seem to be happening at the present time. I would appreciate if you would send all comment to www.31corp.com until I can solve this problem.</p>

<h4>It’s That Time Again – Daryle Lambert’s Antique and Collectibles Blog – Sell Gold and Silver.</h4>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/SwQ_-_YPOlI/AAAAAAAACdA/ehCqJz8FS3g/s1600/2438939672_8f993a9ffb%5B1%5D.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/SwQ_-_YPOlI/AAAAAAAACdA/ehCqJz8FS3g/s400/2438939672_8f993a9ffb%5B1%5D.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p><strong>Time to sell – Thanks to Flicker.com </strong></p>
<p>The last time I made this call for my readers gold was over $1000 an ounce and silver went to $21. After my call, gold went to $800 and silver was as low as $10. I think these markets have peaked. I hope that over the last few months that you have purchased some silver and gold coins like I suggested in my blogs, but now is the time to take your profit. I know that I will be getting all the hate mail again from the gold bugs but that is okay.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine just took a few pieces of old and broken jewelry to a gold buyer and received over $550 and I guarantee you that I wouldn’t have given her $100 for what she showed me. There is still the misconception that gold is a hedge against hard times but I believe that in today’s markets where the true hedge is currencies, gold is just another commercial metal. Yes, India and China are <a href="http://coastalgold.com">buying gold</a> but as we have seen in the past they can just as quickly turn to sellers. In both these countries, jewelry is very important to their culture and that is why they are purchasing gold, not as a hedge.</p>
<p>As I have told you in the past, these markets have almost become a sham. I find it hard to watch thirty minutes of television without someone hyping gold. Do people think they are doing that out of the goodness of their hearts? No, it is because they are making fortunes selling to the uninformed public what they are buying at much cheaper prices. When the market reverses and starts down, see if they are still around or better than that if they will buy the gold they’re selling now back at what the public paid.</p>
<p>How does this pertain to us as antique dealers you may be asking? There still is money to be made on quick turns in gold and silver, just don’t get stuck with it. You may find that you run into someone that has 40 or 50 silver dollars that you can buy. This may be a real opportunity for you. First, I would recommend that you buy them and research each one to see if they have any numerical value. Put the ones that do on the Seeauctions site and sell the rest as scrap. The same advice goes for gold coins and jewelry. I believe that today is an opportunity that won’t last long and as you visit the garage and house sales, pick up all the gold and silver items you can and sell then just as quickly. The items that I spoke of earlier that the lady sold could have easily been purchased for under $100 at a sale. That would definitely met our goal of doubling our money.</p>
<p>Here is what I will leave you with. If at the present time you have gold and silver items, sell them. Also take this opportunity to buy more of these items but sell them the next day or the same day if possible. This love affair won’t continue.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our New Logo – Do You Like It?</p>
<p>This may have been the longest year of my life because the new home site for the “Daryle Lambert’s Antiques and Collectibles Club” just didn’t seem likely to become a reality. But that is all fixing to change and today I saw what our future site will look like. Bob Zehnder and his wife Karla have been working behind the scenes to give me all the services that I wanted our members to receive from the new site. I am confident that within two weeks the site will be functional but even then we will have a lot of work to do before I feel that our members are receiving everything that I have promised.</p>
<p>The marketplace will have more flexibility and the search engine will make items readily accessible to the viewer. The buyers will be able to purchase items owned by the Club immediately and those consigned will be fixed so that offers can be made and accepted through Paypal. The blog will be shown on the home page by clicking the blog button, giving us more space to present the rest of our story. Yes, the archives will work and hopefully I can soon announce some exciting changes that will show up in our archives. Your comments will be shown and the other readers and I will see them with the answers. No comment will go unanswered.</p>
<p>The programs such as the “Associates Program” and the “Million Dollar Race” will be a prominent part of our program again. When I post the new entries on the Club’s inventory sheet, I believe that you will see that the Club is still in the race. The Members Section, which has been slighted, will become something that all members will be proud of and want to share with their friends. Our “Affiliate Program” will be listed and hopefully there will be a great number of people that will want to put our affiliate program on their sites. We will also be extending offers to others to put more of their affiliates on our site to help our members.</p>
<p>But this is the time that I need to call on all of our readers to answer how the new site could service them better. In what ways could our site make it more profitable for you to be a member of the Club? What would you like to be shown or offered that would enhance your experience as one of our members? These are just two questions that I would like for you to help with and I feel sure that you can supply many more. I am so excited that finally the hard work is going to pay off and you, the members, will be the recipients, thanks to your patience and faith in our Club. If you would like to discuss the coming changes, you may also call 847-784-8544 and I promise we can talk until all your questions are answered.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking it out. Be assured that those treasures that I dreamed about so many years ago after reading Treasure Island will soon be ours.</p>

<h4>eBay Now – Find Treasures</h4>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/SuBZ5cPuJOI/AAAAAAAACZo/lv_1wfP3Ba0/s1600-h/4ad8a68569ec4dc0%5B1%5D.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/SuBZ5cPuJOI/AAAAAAAACZo/lv_1wfP3Ba0/s400/4ad8a68569ec4dc0%5B1%5D.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to EBAY</p>
<p>I have been both positive and negative on eBay over the years but now might be the time to search there for treasures. I received an email from one of my favorite readers, Vicki, and she asked my opinion of two items listed on eBay. It didn’t take long for me to answer that both items met the rules for buying that are in our book, “31 Steps to Your Millions in Antiques and Collectibles.” If these two items can be purchased close to the price they’re listed for now, it should be an easy double of that price when they are resold.</p>
<p>How can that be, you must be asking. The first piece that I was asked to look at was a vase where the signature on the bottom was very hard to read. However, because of the script on its bottom there was no doubt who made it. This vase could easily bring $250 if its identity was known, so upon relisting this piece and attaching the company’s name in the description, this vase should do quite well. I can’t divulge the name of the piece because the auction is still running. The second piece was a glass figural lamp and I found where one just like it had sold a short time ago for much more in the completed listings on eBay. If Vicki is fortunate enough to purchase these two items, her return should be at least 100% of her investment. That would mean she had taken one step forward in her “Million Dollar Race” on that money.</p>
<p>I am beginning to see a pattern where people who are listing their items on eBay are taking very little time to describe them properly. In some cases this can be attributed to not being able to identify the piece because the name can’t be read on the bottom or simply because it isn’t signed. A knowledgeable dealer, however, still can identify it. Yes, this is where all those hours of pouring over auction catalogs and visiting antiques shows begin to pay off.</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion that might help you find a treasure on eBay. Enter “art glass” in eBay’s search engine and as you skim through the listings, which should be many, watch for items that aren’t properly identified. Next do the same with art pottery, paintings and porcelain. If you can find one piece each night, this could create that opportunity that you have been searching for to turn your life around. Other people’s mistakes can be your good fortune and it costs you nothing but time. I will be more than glad to help you identify the pieces that you spot and hopefully, working together, this will put money in your pocket as it does Vicki’s.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future we will be able to receive comments on the blog but that doesn’t seem to be happening at the present time. I would appreciate if you would send all comment to www.31corp.com until I can solve this problem.</p>

<p>Toshiko Takaezu – Thanks to Flicker.com</p>
<p>Many times I have passed by what I though was a new piece of pottery because to me it looked cheap. Have you done the same, seen a vase that is unglazed to the eye and looks like it was made yesterday, and just kept walking? The browns, tans, blacks and dark green colors just didn’t say anything to you so they didn’t get a second look. I hope that you will rethink those decisions in the future after reading this blog.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I don’t have any idea how many times I have seen pieces of pottery with that oriental look sitting on a table and even when I did elect to pick them up and found a signature, I quickly set them back down. But no more, because I am going to introduce you to Toshiko Takaezu who is a master at combining Eastern and Western culture into her pottery. She was born in Hawaii in 1929 and is of Japanese descent. This lady is willing to take on any dimension when it comes to her pottery, with some of her pieces measuring over 6 ft tall. Not only is she a very gifted potter, but teaching at Princeton for over 23 years makes her one of the leading scholars on pottery in the United States.</p>
<p>I am continually amazed at how little I know and how much there is to learn. The wonderful thing about this knowledge that we can receive is that it is free and with every new thing we learn it gives us a new chance to make money. You can learn more about Toshiko Takaezu in the book “Toshiko Takaezu – The Earthen Bloom”. I suggest that you see if it can be purchased used on Amazon or Abebooks. Also, here is a site [<a href="http://www.janm.org/exhibitions/takaezu/press.php"> Toshiko Takaezu</a> ] that can give you additional information on this amazing artist.</p>
<p>Here is why it might be worth your time to find out more about Takaezu. I will list three of her pieces that have sold at auction. First, a piece called “Moonpot”, that measures just 10 ½ inches and is signed, bears an Oriental look and unglazed with white and tan coloring sold at Rago Auction 4/12/2008 for $16,000. Second, “Ceramic Vessel” measuring just 8 inches with the Oriental look, colored tan, black ,white and brown with an open top sold at Rago 4/22/2006 for $9600 and last but not least a garden seat sold at Butterfield’s on 6/10/2005 for $7600. I have to admit I would not have given any of these pieces a second glance but that is the past. Watch me now as people ask each other why I am taking the time to look at those pieces.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future we will be able to receive comments on the blog but that doesn’t seem to be happening at the present time. I would appreciate if you would send all comment to www.31corp.com until I can solve this problem.</p>

Words of Caution</p>
<p>What do I mean that “American is Cheap”? No it isn’t that we as people don’t spend money but that our dollar is at an all time low which allows other countries to benefit on an exchange basis. They can buy more in this country than they can in their own with the same amount of money. So your question should be, how do we sell in those foreign markets?</p>
<p>First, eBay might give you an edge because of their international exposure, plus by using their services you don’t have to worry about exchange rates or getting your money. Second, you might want to be sure if you go the auction route that the auction house you choose has connections in the foreign markets. Local or regional auction houses usually don’t command a large foreign following and this should be taken into account, especially on expensive items.</p>
<p>One method of selling pieces overseas is to list only one item and then, when it is sold, contact the purchaser to see if they might be interested in more pieces. Yes eBay might frown on this practice but they get the commission on what has been sold at their auction and that is what you have agreed to do. Always check the space that says you will sell your items internationally when these markets are your targets.</p>
<p>I am aware of one collector that has sold almost his entire collection of art glass to a German gentleman and the price was seldom discussed because with the exchange rate, these pieces were going there at a small percentage of what an American would have had to pay for them. My friend sets the price and the customer almost always says yes. Wouldn’t be nice if it were always that way here? Usually we have to ask more than we really want for an item because the customer is looking for a bargain and tries to lowball us.</p>
<p>When I started in the Antique and Collectible business, the currency situation was reversed from what it is now and often I would buy a lot of my inventory from England, Germany and France. I believe this country is going in the wrong direction and if it continues the world will completely turn its back on the dollar. The “Greenback” as our money was known will not attract the foreign interest and soon our inflation will destroy our country.</p>
<p>Here is a little story I heard once upon a time. China’s inflation was spiraling out of control so a gentleman there called the airport and asked how much money it would take to fly to the United States. The answer came rather swiftly; a suitcase full would do it. So he left his hotel with the suitcase of money and arrived at the ticket counter where he deposited the suitcase on the counter and asked for his ticket. “Oh I’m sorry, Sir”, the clerk said, “it takes two suitcases of money now.” That sound like a cute little story but if this country doesn’t come to its senses, that will be us.</p>

Your Red Cross in Action – Thanks to <a href="http://www.guitsrz-for-ever.com/">www.guitsrz-for-ever.com</a></p>
<p>During these days when we wonder if anyone cares, there is one symbol that is recognized by all people worldwide that show some do. Due to the great European wars, The International Red Cross came into existence in 1863 as a humanitarian group . The American chapter of the Red Cross began in 1881. There are 145 societies of the Red Cross around the world and wherever there is an emergency you will find the Red Cross there. The symbol that is so recognized by all was adopted in 1929, that being the cross. The Red Cross is not a government agency even though Congress approves of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest name associated with the Red Cross was Clara Barton and after her work during the Civil War she traveled to Europe to study the methods of the Red Cross. After she returned to America, the organization was formed here.</p>
<p>I can still see the World War I and World War II posters showing the Red Cross nurses helping injured soldiers returning from battle. There was never a better feeling for an injured soldier than being treated by one of the Red Cross nurses.</p>
<p>Red Cross memorabilia both honors the nurses’ work but also pays respect for the compassion shown during some of the world’s most tragic times. This organization is one of the few that has never had its reputation tarnished and it stands as a beacon of what we should be and feel.</p>
<p>Some of the most collected items are the pins from around the world. The Red Cross medal “Order of Estonia” sold for $510. Most all medals of the Red Cross are eagerly sought after and bring great money. Another medal, the GVR Royal 1st class nurse’s medal brought $429. Posters that show the Red Cross nurse doing her duty helping a service man are very popular and can bring in $1000 or more. Even uniforms are searched for and their value is set by there uniqueness. But perhaps the number one item that most remember are the Red Cross Christmas stamps, which started in 1907. Groups of these can bring you hundreds of dollars. Don’t we wish that all people had the spirit of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future we will be able to receive comments on the blog but that doesn’t seem to be happening at the present time. I would appreciate if you would send all comment to www.31corp.com until I can solve this problem.</p>

<h4>“Sarah Palin” – Daryle Lambert’s Antique and Collectible Blog – Love or Hate her.</h4>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/SsdDthsq6aI/AAAAAAAACW4/deKAB8AfWz0/s1600-h/capt.d413db538b214457bb8d9b6a07c6a30f.books_palin_cover_nyet754%5B1%5D.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sozZZCWv_aU/SsdDthsq6aI/AAAAAAAACW4/deKAB8AfWz0/s400/capt.d413db538b214457bb8d9b6a07c6a30f.books_palin_cover_nyet754%5B1%5D.jpg" border="0"></a> Love Her or Hate Her – Thanks to news.yahoo.com</p>
<p>There are some people that demand either your love or hatred and Sarah Palin is just such a person. Little known until the Presidential election when she popped on the pubic scene as John McCain choose her as his running mate on the Republican ticket as vice president. Just a little sassy and with a quick wit, she soon captured the hearts of the conservative wing of the party. Good looks and a great family didn’t hurt her either. Her husband, an athletic chap that loved to take dog sleds across the frozen tundra, and a special needs child made her a natural to run for the office of Vice President.</p>
<p>She had taken on the sitting Republican governor of Alaska and defeated him and her approval rating was in the 80′s. Thinking that the women would flock to her side if she threw her hat into the ring, proved to be a mistake as the followers of Hillary Clinton move to Obama instead. The biggest problem with her candidacy was that she overshadowed her running mate John McCain and made him look like the old man he was. The jealousy soon spilled out and the infighting in the ranks soon doomed any chance for a Republican victory.</p>
<p>Now that Sarah has broken away from the strings of being Governor, she has began establishing herself for the run for President in 2012. Her new book “Sarah Palin Going Rogue” will soon be on the book stands and even before its release it is number one, with a first printing of 1.5 million copies.</p>
<p>I believe that anything pertaining to Sarah Palin will become valuable and our members should begin picking up anything that shows her image. If it is signed that will make it a treasure. I am going to list a few items that have sold on eBay and believe it or not I wish I had purchased them all. First, however, can you believe that someone paid $63,500 to have dinner with her? Not me but it was for a good cause. I could have purchased a Tampa Bay Rays Jersey signed by Sarah for $94 and that was a bargain. Then came the Governor’s signed inauguration pass for $75, autographed Newsweek $75 and a USA signed hock puck also signed by Todd her husband $55.</p>
<p>Just think of all the possibilities: pins, photos, posters, letters, books and personal items that will soon command huge prices. If you remember, I said earlier the same things about Obama and have you seen what some of his items are now bringing? Buy while things are cheap because they won’t stay that way. In my opinion she will have an uphill struggle to ever be President but that won’t hamper the collectors from scrambling for her memorabilia. Be forewarned here first.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future we will be able to receive comments on the blog but that doesn’t seem to be happening at the present time. I would appreciate if you would send all comment to www.31corp.com until I can solve this problem.</p>
