I count one (1) non-white person, a little kid, in this entire 1:20 video.

Also, there’s the meme, popular among the far-far-right, that Obama is “arrogant,” because he wears his intellect on his sleeve. How do we feel about a video, putatively about the “common people,” spattered with shots of adoring fans waving Sarah’s book, and concluded with a showy signature?

Some of my best friends are white.

I try not to think too badly about rich old white people, because I hope–nay, plan!–to be one someday.

Wow. That’s really all I can say about this post. So let me help you out before you make yourself look any worse Ames. Gallup released some polling data in march that disputes the entire implication of this horrible post. It found that:

“…In several other respects, however — their age, educational background, employment status, and race — Tea Partiers are quite representative of the public at large.”

Specifically, on race they found this:

TP All US Adults
Non-Hispanic White 79% 75%
Non-Hispanic Black 6% 11%
Other 15% 15%

They also match up on a variety of other demographics. The end-conclusion is that they represent the country pretty accurately in non-political demographics.

Get some therapy or take a vacation Ames. The obsession has left the realm of weird and landed in unhealthy territory.

Given that the link cites a 95% confidence interval of +/- 4% there is statistically significantly less black people in the tea party movement than in average population, if I am reading Gallup’s poorly detailed survey methods correctly.

Oh that’s fine, I don’t doubt it. Interesting that Sarah’s commercial isn’t as representative, then?

i’m going to use language I rarely use on the Internet here Ames in hopes of getting through to you…

WHO THE FUCK CARES?! Jesus Christ this is just stupid. It’s a silly publicity video, it’s not a Ken Burns documentary. You’re losing it Ames. You have no way of knowing who is in that crowd. Could you spot a light-skinned hispanic in a crowd of hundreds? I doubt it. I counted at least 4 ‘brown-skinned people’ but it doesn’t matter. IT’S A FUCKING PUBLICITY VIDEO!!!!!!

Seriously man, I like reading your blog, but this makes me question where you’re headed.

Haha… I think I broke your brain…

Comment by ACG (http://www.acandidworld.com)

no – you should just be better than that.

And I gotta say, Mike’s right again on this one. I’m choosing this very specifically, not off-the-cuff at all: this reads like Main Page Right. You’re beefing on the signature? The books being waved? Mike already got the race thing covered. You’re after SP like Andy goes after BO. Move along, brother-man.
