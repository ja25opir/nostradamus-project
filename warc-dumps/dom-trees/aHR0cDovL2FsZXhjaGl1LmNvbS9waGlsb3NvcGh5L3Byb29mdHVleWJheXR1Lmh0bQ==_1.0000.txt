    <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp; The sun represents the Empire

    #40&nbsp;&nbsp; The first elected president of China</big></font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><big>1, 2, 3, and 4.&nbsp; A landlord without a land.&nbsp; Little
    government, functions beside the communists.&nbsp; The one from the east is
    snobbish.&nbsp; On the head, there is no Mao.&nbsp; And on his feet, there are no shoes.
    &nbsp; If Lee comes out, the frost will dissolve.&nbsp; The one who created me is the
    monkey, and the one who killed me is the bear.</big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Explanation:&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">1, 2, 3, 4</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.&nbsp; That means the Republic of China will
    have 10 presidents.&nbsp; Right now, Chen Sui Bien of Taiwan is the 10th president. &nbsp;
    So Chen will be the last president of the Republic of China.&nbsp; So this prophecy
    foretold that Chen will either declear independence of Taiwan and change the name from
    'Republic of China' into 'Republic of Taiwan', or Taiwan will be invaded and be conquered
    by the Communist China.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">A landlord without a land</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means the first few presidents of Taiwan have no control over China
    although they said they represent the entire China.&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">Little
    government functions beside the communists<small>.</small></font><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;
    </font><font color="#00FFFF">The one from the east is snobbish</font><font color="#FFFF00">.&nbsp;
    &nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">On the head, there is no Mao</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means Taiwan, an island located in the East coast of China, does not take
    orders from Mao.&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">On his feet, there are no shoes</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means Taiwan has no adequate weapons and it does not have enough people
    to back it up.&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">If Lee comes out, the frost will
    dissolve.</font><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp; This points to Lee Deng Huay.&nbsp; Lee Deng
    Huay was the 9th president.&nbsp; When Lee took over the office, he allowed the Taiwanese
    citizens to visit China.&nbsp; China and Taiwan also started&nbsp; import/exporting in his
    era.&nbsp; So the frost between China and Taiwan did dissolve when Lee appeared.&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">'The one who created me is the monkey, and the one who killed me is the
    bear.' </font><font color="#FFFF00">Monkey, in Chinese astrology, represents the West.
    &nbsp; The West is USA.&nbsp; USA was the one which helped the Republic of China come to
    power.&nbsp; So this means that the USA created the Republic of China.&nbsp; The bear
    represents Soviet Union.&nbsp; Soviet Union helped the Communist China come to power.
    &nbsp; So the bear is the one which will kill the Republic of China.&nbsp; This indicates
    that in the future, the Communist China will destroy Taiwan!&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; Give
    me 5!</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Explanation: </font><font color="#00FFFF">The grass and trees
    grew downward. + and - switch positions.&nbsp; Up is earth, and down is the sun. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Every sentence described the characteristic of communism, which ignored
    the importance of economy and defied social status.&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">Everyone
    must wear red on his head without a head</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means everyone

    years of big mistake</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means 28 years of misery for China.

    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Explanation:&nbsp; Song Ching-Lin was the wife of Sun Wen, the
    establisher of People's Republic of China.&nbsp; She studied in United States before she
    returned to China to marry Sun.&nbsp; When she came to power in the 1920s, China became a
    lot more peaceful and economy has improved quite a bit.&nbsp; In 1926, she publicly
    accused Chiang, Kai-Shek of being a traitor of the Republican Party.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">The bow is on the ground.&nbsp; Dangerous, but not so dangerous</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means Chiang Kai-Shek would like to murder her just like the way how he
    murdered all of his other opponents.&nbsp; But too bad that Song was the wife of the
    deceased founder of the Republican Party.&nbsp; Murdering her will also ruin Chiang's own
    reputation.&nbsp; And on top of that, Song was also the sister of Chiang's wife. &nbsp;
    Each time Chiang came up with a plan to physically hurt Song, his wife always ruined his
    plan in order to protect her sister.&nbsp; Therefore, she spoke out against Chiang's
    government with full potential and successfully led many mass protests against Chiang.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Explanation:&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">King is not king.

    &nbsp; In Chinese astrology, the green dragon represents the east.&nbsp; This means Cheng
    escapes to the east (Taiwan) and found a new shelter.&nbsp; </font><font color="#00FFFF">Want
    to end, but don't feel like ending</font><font color="#FFFF00"> means Cheng refused to

    They prohibited the use of drugs and prostitution.&nbsp; They executed all famous
    gangsters.&nbsp; The liberation army took over Tibet and ended Tibet's inhumane slave
    trade and ridiculous religious laws.&nbsp; Everyone called Mao a saint.</font></p>

    River's water is not yellow</font></strong><font color="#FFFFFF"> is basically telling us
    the new leader's name.&nbsp; There are two main rivers in China.&nbsp; One is the 'Yellow
    River', and the other one is the 'Long Brook'.&nbsp; (Foreigners call it "Yangtze
    River".) &nbsp; If the 9 Curves Yellow River's water is not Yellow, it must be
    pointing at the Long Brook because Long Brook's water is clear.&nbsp; The Long Brook also
    has 9 main curves.&nbsp; The word for "Brook" in Chinese is
    "Jiang".&nbsp; Therefore, Jiang Ze-Min becomes the new leader of China.&nbsp; At
    first,&nbsp; Deng Shao-Ping&nbsp; wanted to let&nbsp; Zhao Ze-Yang&nbsp; become the next
    leader.&nbsp; But during the Tiananmen Square incident, Zhao supported the students.
    &nbsp; Zhao was immediately arrested for supporting the students.&nbsp; So instead, Jiang
    Ze-Ming becomes the next leader.</font></font></p>
