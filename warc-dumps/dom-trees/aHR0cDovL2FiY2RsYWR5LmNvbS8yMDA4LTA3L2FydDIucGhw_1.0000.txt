            <p class="style19">Poignant. Intense. Heartbreaking. A can of worms. 
              These words, in short, describe <em>Project Kashmir</em>, directed 
              by Senain Kheshgi and Geeta V. Patel and beautifully shot by Academy 
              Award® winner Ross Kauffman (<em>Born Into Brothels</em>, 2004). 
              The premise is deceptively simple: Kheshgi and Patel have been trying 
              to understand the role of ethnicity and religion in the seemingly 
              never-ending conflict in Kashmir since 2002. When they arrive in 
              the Kashmiri Valley, however, they realize that this disputed area 
              that was once paradise will not answer their questions so easily.

		<tbody><tr>
			<td valign="top" colspan="2"><p class="style19">The directors are 
              an interesting pair in themselves. Though both are South Asian-American, 
              the spunky Kheshgi is a Pakistani Muslim, the daughter of parents 
              who lived through the trauma of Partition. The calmer Patel is Indian 
              and Hindu, and her parents are blissfully unaware of her plans to 
              visit the deeply terrorized state. Together, armed with nothing 
              more than determination and courage, Kheshgi and Patel meet Muzamil, 
              Khurram and Aarti Tikoo – all affected by the conflict to 
              varying degrees. </p>
            <p class="style19">Muzamil, an editor with a leading Indian national 
              daily, is a smoker, cynic and philosopher. He admits casually that 
              he did have dreams of being a militant as an idealistic youngster, 
              dreams of “holding an AK-47 and thinking you can change the 
              world,” he says with a sardonic grin. He not only cautions 
              Kheshgi and Patel against accepting anyone’s perspective—including 
              his own—as truth but also serves as a valuable guide, leading 
              them into the heart of villages affected by the apparently random 
              checks by the Indian army for insurgents. And then there’s 
              Aarti Tikoo, a journalist and a displaced Kashmiri <em>Pandit</em> 
              (Hindu Brahmin). </p>
            <p class="style19">Besides being from two opposite religions, this 
              unlikely duo is also the best of friends. While Muzamil and Aarti 
              Tikoo laugh at their shared sense of camaraderie in a strife-ridden 
              world, they are no strangers to fear and grief. A decade or so earlier, 
              when she was a young girl, Aarti Tikoo’s family was intimidated 
              and forced out of their home by Muslims. In fact, it’s heart-wrenching 
              when she takes the crew to a place that was once inhabited by Kashmiri 
              <em>Pandits</em>. A few faded pictures of Hindu gods and a torn 
              page of a calendar that dates back to 1989 are the only witnesses 
              to the violence that happened there. And later, when she takes them 
              to her own home, now nothing more than a pile of brick and dust, 
              her pain is overwhelming. There’s a pregnant moment when her 
              old Muslim neighbors recognize her and invite her into their homes 
              for a cup of tea.</p>
            </td>

		<tr> 
          <td valign="middle" width="80%"><p class="style19">Balancing Muzamil’s 
              cynicism and Aarti Tikoo’s sense of hopelessness is Khurram, 
              a human rights activist who lost his leg and a friend in a bombing. 
              While he’s aware of the brutality perpetrated in the name 
              of freedom and peace, he holds out hope for a better tomorrow. From 
              documenting the cases of human rights violations to mourning his 
              dead friend, Khurram is the face of a Kashmiri trying to move on 
              and rebuild a life among the ruins. It’s also clear that the 
              immeasurable toll of the grim 60-year war on the landscape and the 
              people is having an effect on the filmmakers themselves. </p>
            <p class="style19">While Kheshgi begins to feel a certain kind of 
              kinship with those fighting the Indian occupation, Patel asks the 
              hard questions and begins to feel the onus of being an Indian and 
              Hindu woman in a predominantly Muslim society. As Kheshgi succinctly 
              says, “It’s a complicated issue, this place is not simple.”

              are a subtle understatement given that Kashmir is brimming with 
              political rallies, missing loved ones, lost livelihoods, ruined 
              homes, hope, laughter, songs, grief and desperation. In the end, 
              there’s a wider message: conflict resolution. As one <em>Project 
              Kashmir</em> audience member at a recent screening put it, the conflict 
              is “a political ideology versus that of a lost universe.” 
              And it may be that the documentary leaves audiences pondering whether 
              resolution is possible in the face of fanatic religious fervor and 
              indiscriminate militant oppression. Whatever the answer, it’s 
              clear that <em>Project Kashmir</em> leaves you feeling divided.<br><br>

                    Kauffman, Geeta Patel and Senain Kheshgi</strong></p>
                  <p class="style19"><strong>How did it feel to come back to the everyday life 
                    in the United States after the Kashmir experience?</strong><br>
                    Kheshgi: Kashmir changes you. I remember coming home and driving 
                    down the street and having these weird post-traumatic stress 
                    moments. It took a while to forget, but you can’t forget. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="style19"><strong>How much research went into the project before you 
                    left for Kashmir?</strong><br>
                    Patel: Two years of research through people and resources. 
                    We spoke with Kashmiris from both Muslim, Hindu, Sikh… 
                    any background. <br>
                    Kauffman: I didn’t do any research.<br>
                    Kheshgi: Actually, we took Ross to a meeting with a Kashmiri 
                    <em>Pandit</em> family.</p>
                  <p class="style19"><strong>Ross, when you picked up on the girls’ 
                    tension, was it something that you saw and went for it, and 
                    did it take you by surprise?</strong><br>
                    Kauffman: It’s very hard to ignore tension when it’s 
                    in the room. My job was just to let what was happening in 
                    the room happen and try not to be too hands-on… just 
                    let things happen in the frame. </p>
                  <p class="style19"><strong>Any projects in the future for the three of you together?</strong><br>
                    Kauffman: This film is going to have a long life and these 
                    two are going to be [traveling] pretty hard. </p>
                  <p class="style19"><strong>Do you have a novel coming out on this?</strong><br>
                    Patel: I hope so! It’s called <em>The Laughing. </em>
