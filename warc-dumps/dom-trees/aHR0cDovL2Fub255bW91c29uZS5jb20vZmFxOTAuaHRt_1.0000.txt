    Thanksgiving</font>

</p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">By Dean G.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">D</font><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman">id you know that the first
    Thanksgiving in North America was celebrated in Canada in 1578, forty-three
    years before the Pilgrims celebrated in October 1621.&nbsp; Martin Frobisher,
    an English navigator who was searching for the Spice Islands, landed on
    Baffin Island. He established a settlement and held the first ceremony of
    thanksgiving in what is now Newfoundland.&nbsp; In Europe farmers celebrated
    their harvest times to acknowledge their thanks for good seasons and
    harvests. They would fill cornucopias, usually a curved goat's horn, with
    fruits and grains.</font></font></p><font size="4">
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pilgrims had landed near Cape Cod the
    1620, and half of them didn’t make it through the winter, dying of scurvy and
    exposure. The survivors were so grateful that they were still alive, they celebrated
    Thanksgiving with what meager rations were available, mainly corn, pumpkins,
    cranberries and a few wild turkeys brought to the table by their Indian neighbors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Thanksgiving
    is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada and the fourth
    Thursday of November in the States.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, though, I don’t have to sit down just one day out
    of the year and celebrate my gratitude with a 2,000 calorie dinner---wow do I love pumpkin
    pie. I try to be grateful everyday, 365 days of the year.&nbsp; And grateful for what?</font></p><ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">First and foremost----my sobriety and a Higher Power watching over me.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">I don’t awake every morning with a sickening pounding inside my head. I can even
        remember what happened the night before. I don’t have to go outside and check the car
        for fear blood would be on a crushed fender.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Not having to look the morning after for the bottle I hid some place, praying that I
        would find it and there would be enough left to steady my nerves. Or awake in a strange
        bed (often on the floor) in a strange house and wonder where the "H" I am.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Spending the day without guilt of breaking yet another promise to a loved one that I
        would never drink again. Or promising to take the kids to the park on Saturday morning,
        but instead dashing to a local bar for "one drink" that turned into a dozen. I
        always meant to keep the promises. However, the power of alcohol was too cunning, baffling
        and powerful.</font> </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">I can hold a cup of coffee without shaking its contents all over the floor. Better yet,
        I can hand someone coffee in a cup and saucer without spilling a drop.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Not having to put into a neighbor’s trash all my empty liquor bottles for fear I
        would be exposed by the garbage man. Of course, the neighbor would have a lot of
        explaining to do if his wife ever looked into the trash.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Opening the drapes to let in the sunshine. Answering the phone when it rings, knowing
        it’s not someone dunning me for money. Even so, as I did early in sobriety, I made
        arrangements to pay the debt. I used to have enough unopened mail to fill a small post
        office. Bills were meant to ignore--and so was anyone ringing my doorbell.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Not having to endure sick hangovers for days at a time, or waiting for a 6 a.m. bar to
        open to use a straw to have that first drink because both hands were shaking like hula
        hoops in action.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Work. No more calling in with the flu, first on Mondays and later it became Monday
        through Friday as the "flu" progressed. Eventually, I didn’t have to call
        in at all. You guessed it. I was terminated (or fired as they used to say).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Driving my car with both eyes open. Often I had to shut one eye in order not to see two
        white lines at the same time. Instant double vision. There were times, too, when after a
        "last call" at a local bar I couldn’t find my car. The solution. So the
        next day I reported it stolen. It worked until I made the mistake of calling the cops from
        the bar (I was wasted), and they found it parked outside.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Or not having to worry about falling on my face during a sobriety test, and then ending
        up in a drunk tank with all its filth and stench. True disgust with myself.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Above all, I am grateful that I lost the war. I surrendered. Put up the white flag. No
        longer did I have to battle alcoholism. It was a life and death battle and by losing I am
        still the winner "a day at a time."</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough already. I could go on and on giving thanks, including
    enjoying all of Mother Nature’s wonderful sights and sounds of this world. Sure,
    there occasions when I get "the downs," and start feeling sorry for myself. This
    usually passes with a kick in the butt from my Higher Power to remind me of all
    life’s gifts.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I am not unique. Countless others can identify with
    my gratitude list. Still others in the thick of the battle are still enduring the same
    pain I suffered for so many years before finding Alcoholics Anonymous. I can honestly say
    the fellowship saved my life. Others have not been as fortunate, the disease of alcoholism
    taking its tragic toll of those unable to put up that white flag.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sobriety in my life. Without it, I would have nothing. It’s just that simple.
    Therefore, my Thanksgiving is year-round.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">DIAGNOSING ALCOHOLISM</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late in my drinking career I was in such denial that if
    someone called me an alcoholic, I was ready to fight. How dare they think I had a problem
    with alcohol. Sure, I got drunk about every time I vowed to just take one drink---you know
    to take the A.M. edge off--and wound up 10 sheets to the wrong wind. Funny thing, people
    could call me a drunk and I could accept this. But being referred to as an alcoholic got
    me so mad I had to take another drink just to chill out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical science can diagnose just about every killer disease.
    But not alcoholism. Sure, there are the 20 questions to make you think twice if you flunk
    a couple or more of them--like do you drink in the morning? Doesn’t about every drunk
    try to get the first one down without it coming up--mine did through my nose. Still there
    is no x-ray, no blood test (other than the amount of alcohol in your blood at the time) or
    one of those high tech diagnostic machines to trigger a red light for the Big A.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I wonder if such a technology existed for detecting
    the disease of alcoholism, would I have stopped drinking? Probably not. Unfortunately, we
    go to any lengths in a hopeless attempt to prove we are not alcoholics. Take for an
    example, an airline pilot I knew years ago. He was a senior pilot for one of the largest
    airlines, flying the prime cross-country routes. One morning he took off in a DC-10, fully
    loaded with passengers, from Washington D.C., and either misheard or didn’t hear the
    instructions from the air traffic controller. He turned right instead of left and the Big
    Bird was headed at a low altitude directly over the White House. You can imagine the panic
    when military radar spotted the plane aimed at the most secure home in the nation where
    the president was undoubtedly enjoying his morning coffee, unaware that a possible
    terrorist was planning to join him.</font> </p>
    </font><p><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, the pilot not only got a four-letter tongue
    lashing when he landed. He was grounded and thoroughly investigated by authorities to see
    if he was a subversive out to do in the president. In order for him to get his wings back,
    he was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing, and because he had a history of
    "social drinking" attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (at least three a week)
    for a year. The grounded pilot, on a year’s leave of absence with full pay) followed
    instructions to the letter (probably fearing loss of a very good income), and I would see
    him at my home meeting every week. Of course, at first he never acknowledged he had a
    problem, though towards the end of his "sentence" he thought he may be one of us
    until his company ordered him to be re-examined by a psychiatrist. He was given a battery
    of tests. Well, you would have thought he was given a last minute reprieve on death row
    when he announced at the next meeting that he passed with flying colors, the psychiatrist
    pronounced he was not an alcoholic, and he was cleared to fly again. How lucky can one be?
    His luck ran out within a year. Fortunately, he was not flying a plane when on a layover
    he went on a four-day drunk. However, I am happy to report that he finally self-diagnosed
    himself as an alcoholic, and returned to AA. Instead of luck, his Higher Power was good to
    him, returning him to the captain’s seat of an airliner.</font></font></p>
