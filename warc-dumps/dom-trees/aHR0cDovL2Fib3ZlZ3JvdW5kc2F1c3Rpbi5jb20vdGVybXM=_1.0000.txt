<p><span class="style2">Above Grounds Terms of Service</span><br> <br> <strong>A. Your Relationship With Above Grounds</strong><br>Welcome to Above Ground’s website. By using this site you agree to the following terms and
conditions, policies, and guidelines. If you do not accept the terms of this user agreement, you
may not use this website. Above Grounds may revise these Terms and Conditions in the future,
and you will be able to find the most current version of this agreement on our website in these
Terms of Service.<br> <br> <strong>B. Appropriate Conduct</strong><br>It is the intent of Above Grounds to maintain this website such that only content that is edifying
to the body will be contained therein. You understand that submission of text, advertisements,
graphics, music, video, sounds, photographs, or other material (“Content”) is the sole
responsibility of the originator of such content. Above Grounds reserves the right, without
obligation, to pre-screen, modify, remove, move, or refuse any Content submitted to Above
Grounds or the Above Grounds website.
Above Grounds will not condone the submission of Content that, in the opinion of Above
Grounds, is not edifying to the body of Christ, and/or is unconstructive, unhelpful, hurtful, or
negative Content that may disparage churches, groups, or individuals. Such content, upon
discovery by Above Grounds, may be removed without notice from the website at the sole
discretion of Above Grounds.</p> 
<p><br></p> <strong><a id="b1" name="b1"></a>C. City Calendar Terms of Use</strong><br> 
  The following are conditions for being a user and adding  events to the Above Grounds city calendar.<br><br>1) The purpose of this calendar is to promote unity among the Christian
body in the greater Austin area. Please keep this in mind when adding
an event. We encourage diversity in the type of events posted, and we monitor the calendar daily to maintain the integrity of
not only Above Grounds, but also the mission that we are pursuing and
all others that are in support of this mission. That said, the type of
events posted must be ecumenical in nature. <br> <br>We WILL REMOVE EVENTS that are:<br>a) business or personal solicitations,<br>b) posted for the sole gain of an individual or business,<br>c) endorsing a political party; endorsing a religion other than
Christianity; endorsing an opinion that is not related to Christian
beliefs, or that is in opposition to any part of Christianity,<br>d) written with vulgar language or crude humor,<br>e) containing inappropriate images or verbiage in any part of the posting,<br>f) not family friendly and would be inappropriate for children.<br>g) typical church services (special holiday services and special guest speakers are acceptable)<br> <br>The location of events posted must be within a 35 mile radius from downtown  Austin. <br> <br>-Above Grounds reserves the right to contact the submitter of any event
posted to determine it's validity and/or whether it should be on this
calendar. Above Grounds may remove any event posted for any reason. If
we do remove an event, the submitter will be contacted regarding the
reason for removal. The user may present an argument as to why the
event should not be removed. If the user chooses to address the
removal, Above Grounds will replay back with a final decision. If the
user seems uncooperative with the decision made, Above Grounds is more
likely to remove the user's account privileges. <br> <br>&nbsp;Regarding user accounts, we also reserve the right to:<br>a) Cancel a user's account due to a user violating this terms of use
agreement that the user agreed to comply to when the user signed up for
an account.<br>b) Block a user from registering a second time for an account if they have  previously violated the terms of use.<br>c) Not allow a user to sign up for an account. We will automatically deny an account request from a country other than the United States. If your IP address is outside of Texas, we will contact you before approving your account.<br> <br>Above Grounds agrees to NEVER give out or sell any personal information
from any user that signs up for an account with Above Grounds. We will
keep your information private and only contact you regarding your
account and calendar postings.<br> <br> <strong>C. Personal Responsibility</strong><br>  You understand that by using the Above Grounds website you may be exposed to Content that
