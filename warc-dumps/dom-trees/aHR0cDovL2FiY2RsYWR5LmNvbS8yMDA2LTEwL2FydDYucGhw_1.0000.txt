              <em><br>
              </em>Marriages have always been very important to South Asian culture, 
              with much emphasis placed on the “right” marriages at 
              the “right” time. Some parents begin planning for their 
              daughters’ marriages from the moment they are born, and much 
              talk centers around the <em>dulhe raja</em> (groom) who will finally 
              come and sweep the <em>dulhan</em> (bride) off her feet. They will 
              ride (or dance) off into the sunset, beginning a fairytale life 
              filled with laughter and impromptu dance numbers. </p>
            <p class="style19">What happens, though, when this fairytale picture 
              frame starts to crack and fall apart at the seams? What happens 
              when the promises of “til death do us part” and <em>jeevan 
              saathi</em> (lifetime companions) begin to fail under the weight 
              of arguments, fighting and anger?</p>

          <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p class="style19"><br>Some couples are able 
              to manage their differences and come to a healthy understanding 
              of themselves and each other. For other couples, though, what was 
              supposed to be a fairytale marriage starts to unravel in talk of 
              divorce. </p>
            <p class="style19">According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
              current divorce rate in the United States is currently around 30 
              to 40 percent; this means that roughly one-third of all marriages 
              end in divorce within ten years. For those who <a href="http://www.abcdlady.com/2006-09/art5.php" target="_self">live together before 
              marriage,</a> the rate of divorce doubles to about 65 percent within 
              ten years. For those who have been divorced previously and then 
              remarry, the divorce rate is somewhat higher than 30 to 40 percent. 
              While the national divorce rate has declined over the past few years, 
              the South Asian divorce rate seems to be about 13 to 16 percent. 
              Lower than the national average, yes; however, the South Asian divorce 
              rate seems to be holding steady, rather than declining. </p>
            <p class="style19">As always, statistics are fine but do very little to help when 
              you’re the one going through a divorce. </p>
            <p class="style19">Divorce, like any other life change, brings with it an enormous 
              amount of stress. It’s not just stress about the life changes, 
              which are significant, but it’s also the stress of having 
              to adopt a new identity (being single), dealing with community and 
              cultural pressures and then, eventually, reentering the world of 
              dating (which you might have been ecstatic to leave the first time.)</p>
            <p class="style19">In terms of defining the stress associated with divorce, the Holmes-Rahe 
              scale is a measure of significant life events, assigning each one 
              a certain “life crisis” unit which corresponds to the 
              amount of stress that an event creates in one’s life. The 
              highest life crisis unit is 100, the death of a spouse. Closely 
              following that is divorce, ranking at 73. The greater the number 
              of life crisis units in your life in any two year period, the greater 
              your chances of becoming moderately to severely ill. Life changes 
              bring with them significant health issues in the physical, emotional 
              and mental realms. </p>
            <p class="style19">When you are going through a divorce, the most important thing 
              to give yourself is space, time and support. You will need emotional 
              and physical “space” to sort out all the issues associated 
              with divorce. You may need to find a new place to live or become 
              accustomed to living alone in a place you formerly shared with your 
              spouse. You need emotional space to sift through your feelings and 
              try to make some meaning for what happened and why. </p>
            <p class="style19">Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, a well-known psychologist, developed a five-stage 
              process for dealing with grief. If you’ve taken a basic psychology 
              course, you may be familiar with this model, but let’s look 
              at it applied to the concept of divorce. </p>
            <p class="style19">The five stages of dealing with grief are:</p>
            <p class="style19"> 1. Denial: You feel numb, “dazed” 
              and can’t believe this is happening. <br>
              2. Anger: You feel angry and ask yourself “How dare he (or 
              she) do this to me?<br>
              3. Bargaining: You make “deals” with yourself (or God). 
              “If I do this, then please bring him or her back to me<br>
              4. Depression: You feel sad, empty and blue. <br>
              5. Acceptance: You begin to heal from the loss and start to feel 
              hopeful about the future. </p>
            <p class="style19">Now, this process is just a model, and everyone’s 
              process will be different. The stages can also be moved through 
              fluidly; for instance, some people may bargain before they feel 
              anger, and some people may feel anger before they move to denial. 
              Also, the process of moving through the stages is not always progressive: 
              you can be making good progress to acceptance and then something 
              can set you back to anger. </p>
            <p class="style19">If you’re in the process of a divorce, you can expect to 
              feel:</p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Denial:</strong> You may feel numb, shocked and dazed. 
              This usually happens just after the decision has been made or when 
              you’ve received the news (in cases where you didn’t 
              make the choice to seek a divorce). You know you’re in denial 
              when you wake up in the morning and feel fine for a few seconds 
              before you “remember” that you’re getting a divorce. 
              Though denial generally is thought to be a negative state, it actually 
              has positive benefits in this case. Denial is your body’s 
              way of buffering you from extreme pain or devastation. You will 
              move through the denial when you’re ready. </p>
            <p class="style19">In the denial stage, you might find yourself taking lots of time 
              to complete routine tasks. You might feel listless, low energy and 
              feel like doing nothing. These periods of low energy might be followed 
              by times where you are anxious and push yourself to stay extremely 
              busy. Busyness is always a good way to distract yourself from any 
              kind of emotional pain; however, if it goes on too long, you avoid 
              dealing with your feelings, which can keep you in denial much longer 
              than necessary. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Anger:</strong> This one may be easier to identify. Anger 
              is the stage where you feel furious about what’s happening, 
              which may be combined with feelings of powerlessness or helplessness 
              because you can’t change what is occurring. You might feel 
              “riled up” and may be prone to making rash decisions 
              or bad choices. At this stage, you just want to do anything you 
              can to stop feeling bad, and you might make significant changes 
              in your appearance (for example, cutting off your long hair or starting 
              to dress provocatively) or your personal habits (like staying out 
              all night, drinking more heavily).</p>
            <p class="style19">Although South Asian women generally are taught that anger should 
              be avoided, it’s actually a necessary step in the healing 
              process. I always think of anger as a “rising up” of 
              our internal survival instinct and drive. The key here is to channel 
              your anger appropriately and not to do anything which may have negative 
              repercussions for you later. </p>
            <p class="style19">Social support is very critical for moving through the anger stage. 
              You want to spend time with people who love and support you. Avoid 
              people who are critical or tell you to “work it out” 
              when you’ve already determined it can’t be done. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Bargaining:</strong> This stage is reflected in those “little” 
              games we all play with ourselves like, “If I do this, then 
              this will happen” (“If I see a red car, it means he 
              will call me today”). This stage is also very necessary for 
              overcoming divorce because it represents a place for us to try out 
              different patterns of behavior and different kinds of solutions. 
              In this stage, as you keep looking for coincidences, your mind is 
              actually working to find solutions. </p>
            <p class="style19">The bargaining stage is the one where you are most likely to try 
              to rekindle your relationship. You’ve moved through denial, 
              and anger and may be able to view the situation from a broader and 
              wiser perspective. Your initial rush of confusion or hesitation 
              may be gone, and you start to consider what should be done from 
              here. </p>
            <p class="style19">For South Asians, this may be a time of decision: are you going 
              to try and work it out, or not? In our culture, this is the time 
              where family and friends are likely to step in and try to help. 
              They may act as referees or go-betweens, which can be both helpful 
              and harmful—helpful if you and your spouse agree on what needs 
              to happen, harmful if one of you wants the relationship back and 
              the other doesn’t. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Depression:</strong> Depression is the point where you 
              cry a lot and maybe feel yourself starting to let go of certain 
              fantasies you had about your relationship. This stage may be marked 
              by low energy, frequent bouts of crying and a dimmed sense of optimism. 
            </p>
            <p class="style19">For most South Asians, this stage is also accompanied by intense 
              anxiety. Anxiety is a huge part of the divorce process and may move 
              you to do strange things. You may have trouble sleeping, eating 
              or getting through a day without feeling fearful of the future. 
              You might have to deal with economic issues like living on just 
              one salary, especially if your spouse made significantly more than 
              you. You also need to find ways to fill your time, because if you 
              don’t plan something to do, you may find yourself sitting 
              home weekend after weekend, alone. </p>
            <p class="style19">The depression stage can be one of the most challenging to move 
              through, especially for a culture that prizes action over stillness. 
              In this stage, you may be hearing a lot of well meaning (but badly 
              timed) advice about “going out and dating again.” Although 
              this can be tempting, it’s better to give yourself a break 
              from dating for a while. Dating requires a certain amount of resilience 
              which you might not have just yet. Spend time with your friends 
              and give your heart a chance to heal before starting any new romantic 
              relationships. Be gentle with yourself. You’re doing the best 
              you can. </p>
            <p class="style19"><strong>Acceptance:</strong> This is the final stage of the grief 
              process. It is marked by a time of renewed hope and clear thinking. 
              In the early stages of acceptance, you notice that you’re 
              starting to feel happier, and more hopeful. As acceptance progresses, 
              you start to get through the day without thinking of the divorce 
              or your ex, and you start to move ahead in your life and career 
              goals. In this stage, you might accept a new position or move to 
              a new place. You might try out new activities and discover a new 
              hobby. You feel like you’re back on confident ground. Your 
              sleeping and eating patterns return to normal, your energy is back, 
              and you feel more capable than you have in a long time. </p>
            <p class="style19">This is the best part of the divorce process, when you’ve, 
              as I say, “run through hell and then come out the other side.” 
              This is a time for you to start planning your life and working towards 
              your goals. It may be time to get back into the dating scene, armed 
              with new knowledge and information about what you’re looking 
              for. </p>
            <p class="style19">Nobody gets married planning to be divorced. Like any other life 
              change, divorce brings with it a unique set of challenges and rewards. 
              The key is to find a way to navigate the challenges while remaining 
              open to the unexpected gifts. In doing so, you can be sure that 
              you will always be doing the best you can, with where you are and 
              with what you’ve got. Nobody could expect more. </p>
