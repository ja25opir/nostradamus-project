						<p>Please clarify this for me guys (and gals)</p><p>once Tissa credits $125 to your refferals page does that mean he no longer advertises your page?</p><p>The reason i have asked is this: i had only received a handful of leads from Tissa and then my account was credited with 125 and i have received no further leads!</p><p>From everything i have read it says Tissa will advertise my site until i have received 125 in commission.</p><p>Yet it appears to me that my account has simply been credited with the 125 and that the advertising has ceased!</p><p>Would it be fair to assume that Tissa EITHER advertises until we have 125 OR chooses to credit our account adn cease further advertising as well?</p><p>I just need to FULLY understand how every aspect of the program works!</p>

						<p>Good Question Mike,</p><p>Tissa will advertise your link until your account is credited the $125 commission.&nbsp; He usually does this 24-48 hours after your Step3 has gone to 100%.</p><p>Think of the $125 as a bonus commission that he has given you to help get started.&nbsp; Earn $75 more and get paid $200 or more.&nbsp; Take that money and invest in your education or more advertising if you are smart and want to make a business out of this.&nbsp; That's the concept, you know..</p><p>The advertising is for your People Search Engine and not the referral program. So technically he couldn't advertise for you until you reached $125 in referral commissions because for the lazy people that would take forever.</p>

						<p>Hi Goddes,</p><p>Actually the way I did it was by using an email list I had been building for 6 months prior to joining ACME People Search.&nbsp; I had been directing traffic to a capture page that was offering information on Work at Home Business Opportunities. By writing a newsletter to my subscribers I developed a relationship with them. They come to trust you...well at least you hope they do.&nbsp; So when I informed them about APS many jumped in to check it out.</p><p>Email Marketing can be very effective but does require a little work to set up and do it properly. Last thing we want as email marketers is to get in trouble for not adhering to SPAM regulations.&nbsp; Make sure you get your subscribers to opt-in through your Auto-Responder and you have records of the date and IP address they used.&nbsp; Try to be friendly and not too pushy with your subscribers. Give them valuable content and not just sales pitches. Make sure you have an unsubscribe function in place and you adhere to it.</p><p>Start building your list today, it will pay off in the long run as you will undoubtably have other business opportunites to offer in the future.&nbsp; For example our new 8th stream of income GVO !</p><p>Also at the time I was running free classified ads all over the internet and getting some immediate responses there.&nbsp; Many people overlook classified ads and miss out on the instant sign ups you get. If you are trying to get that 1st payment of $200 or more&nbsp; quickly (hopefully to put back into advertising - this is a business after all and you need to grow it) then you need to get some advertising out there quickly.&nbsp; Here is a great post with lots of offers to get started <a href="http://acme-people-search-forum.com/post/35727/#p35727">http://acme-people-search-forum.com/post/35727/#p35727</a></p><p>One thing to remember with Classified advertising is to lead your prospects to a page that gives them more informationa about the business opportunity. Maybe a blog or review page.&nbsp; This will help narrow down the tire kickers and bring in better quality leads to APS.</p><p>I think it would be impossible to cash in on the second month with only 3 or 4 referrals.&nbsp; Did I write that?&nbsp; It actually took me having about 15 or 20 referrals.&nbsp; Most of the money came from the $5 Step1 commissions and I had just enough do Step3 to have my quality score over 15%.&nbsp; I was paid the 6th week I was in APS.</p><p>Because you don't actually have the Step3 commisions in your account until after 65 days it would be impossible to cash out with 3 or 4 referrals in the second month. What I really meant was that in a perfect scenerio you could have only 3 or 4 referrals that did all 3 Steps and after 2 months be paid.</p><p>I like my method where I just brought in a mere 15 - 20 people and got enough to do Step1 and Step3 to get paid in the second month.&nbsp; I guess to me it wasn't that hard becasue I had been building that all too important Email List and running free advertising.</p><p>Hope that helps.&nbsp; Good Luck.</p><p>Mike N.</p>

						<p>Hi Mike!</p><p>It's fine to get others to join but that seems to be the only thing one gets...a new member, a new affiliate that will try his best to get&nbsp; an other then on and on.&nbsp; But so far I have been advertising, submitting to engines and using adwords and I have no downline no affiliates and no money.</p><p>Ok I am an affiliate and a downline to someone, but he/she is the only one getting money or maybe not if he/she never got to get more then one.</p><p>All that to say, it has been 3 years and&nbsp; over 12,000$ spent and&nbsp; less then 500$ in returns.&nbsp; &nbsp;Adwords for one&nbsp; can cost as much as 100$ a month and&nbsp; only gets me penny.</p><p>Where&nbsp; are you guys making money other then catching affiliates? Ho yes I did have an affiliates site with banners from CJ or sites with ClickBank, but there also NADA!</p><p>I see all those sites with nice&nbsp; PhotoShop montage&nbsp; showing a face in front of a big house or fancy car or copies of ClickBank statements but none of those are real proof of success. I know a few&nbsp; millionaires, talk to them and&nbsp; know there are&nbsp; who they are&nbsp; from there&nbsp; real lifestyle.&nbsp; I see them in 5 stars hotels, traveling the world&nbsp; in first class on a short notice, spending a weekend in Paris or London.&nbsp; But none of them need to pretend using empty internet sites with photos.

						<p>Hello everyone,<br>I completed the 3 steps yesterday, not even realizing the minimum payout is $200. :-( I'm terrible at promoting stuff online; I've been trying to do stuff online for several years now and have only made pennies. I'm fiscally broke so cannot fork out money for advertising. And I know I can't keep paying the monthly fees for GDI &amp; ACME, so if I'm not able to make that $200 now, I'm not going to be able to keep this program. I had hoped to do something with this to try to get my family a better Christmas than in years past, but in my experience, people don't trust online businesses - especially people locally. It is really discouraging. I wish someone - anyone - could help me, guide me, instruct me. Don't just say, "It's easy - you just do this, this, and this." Here's another problem: time. I work full-time, have 2 young children, teach part-time, have a spouse who also needs my attention. I cannot nor will I neglect my family. I don't expect a magic wand, but I need a consistent stream of income and I need a way to do it so that I'm not in the red; plus I need it to be just with a few hours of work a week - not 40 because I don't have an extra 40 to spare. </p><p>I know people have made income online. I just have a hard time believing it because I've been burned so many times and so many people have just shrugged me off. I also believe in customer service. If there's no real person there (and for me, someone that I can communicate with via email or IM is sufficient; but phone is nice if needed) then it's hard to put one's faith in such a program. </p><p>I guess I'm rambling here, but I am a real person, burned by numerous programs, have little faith in earning income online, but am willing to try. Have little spare time to put into such a program, though - do have a life. Please, if anyone is willing to take up this challenge and help this person, I'd greatly appreciate it. </p><p>Jamen McGranahan<br>(email jmcgranahan at tds dot net)</p>

						<p>Hi Jamen,</p><p>Welcome to the Forum. You are on the right track and it's okay to ramble. This way we can see everything that is going on with your current situation and try to help best. </p><p>My personal experience and advice for people who are new to all this and have a slightly slower learning ability is to take it slower.</p><p>If you cannot afford advertising right now and you need money quickly. This is not a good combinatin for Online marketing success.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to discourage you but instead trying to save you from expecting too much too fast and giving up. ACME People Search will not burn. It is a legitimate service and business opportunity. Only you can burn yourself by expecting too much too fast.&nbsp; As you jump around from program to program on the internet looking for the so called quick easy money program you will find this out sooner or later...It all comes down to having a legitimate program and learning to advertise it properly.&nbsp; Unfortunately this takes some time and effort and some people get there quicker than others.</p><p>Keep doing what you are doing as far as working all your jobs and just do this part time slowly. That's my advice.&nbsp; Free advertising is very effective but takes time to set up properly and see results. Once you learn how to do it you will be able to apply that knowledge and experience to any online business.&nbsp; This is why Tissa advises that we use a training website like Wealthy Affiliates to learn to advertise properly and effectively.</p><p>Right now WA has a promotion to join for $1 for 7 days. You can go in there and check it out and learn. Search around the forum for free advertising methods. There have been so many good posts on this subject and you can learn so much.<br>Article writing and creating blogs and squidoo pages are the best free advertising methods to get started with.&nbsp; These require more time to set up and see results but in the long run may prove to be the most adventageous for longevity.</p><p>Keep learning from the forum and become an active member. As you learn you can start to help others. Sometimes this is the best way to learn. By reading explanations from others and being interactive many people learn better like that then just reading a "how to manual".&nbsp; We're all different.&nbsp; </p><p>Patience and hard work will get you there but don't expect to make abundant quick money on a limited budget and limited time.</p>

						<p>Bachandp -</p><p>I agree with you completely. I've spent not as much, but have only pennies in return for the various programs I've joined and tried to promote. I don't get it - I just don't: why some people do so well with getting referrals while others struggle. In my opinion, I would think those that do really well would want to help those who are not and possibly share their referrals with these (provided there is evidence of hard work by the individual). It makes sense to me, but unfortunately, our society is built around making as much as you can as quick as you can. Shouldn't we bring others along with us, though, making an even better society? </p><p>Jamen McGranahan<br>jmcgranahan at tds dot net</p>

It's techniques like that which will separate the people who are losing money on PPC from those who eventually make money.&nbsp; Study and keep pushing yourself to do better. There is no one way to have success without advertising online.&nbsp; There are so many methods to try and different ones work well for different people.&nbsp; Some people like to write email letters, some people like making videos, some like to write articles, some like PPC ads.&nbsp; All these methods work but no one can say which one is going to work best for you and then give you the exact way to word your letters, articles, blogs, emails etc.&nbsp; All you can do is learn the techniques of each proven method and the rules that go with them. The rest is up to you to use some creativity of your own.&nbsp; Nobody can hand you the magic ads with the magic words because even those don't work all the time. As the internet evolves so does your advertising.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><br><div class="quotebox"><cite>jmcgranahan wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I really don't want to make an "abundant quick money" - rather, a kick start and once I see that it can actually work, I would continue focusing my efforts on that program.

Getting enough referrals to earn $75 more to get paid shows that you have taken the time to learn and do some work.&nbsp; You see how many people do it on the 125 proof board.&nbsp; It's not easy but it can't be that hard if you take the time to learn and advertise.</p><p>If you owned a Pizzaria of your own and a Pizza Hut opened one block away what would you do to advertise that your pizza is better?&nbsp; Well, I would point out the fact that my ingredients were homemade and my oven was better quality. With my large pizza you get a free salad....</p><p>You get the idea, you have to be creative and point out the benefits of eating at my Pizzaria. Same with People Search you need to point out the benefits why using this search engine is better. </p><p>I think I just found out why Tissa made those ACME Pizza Search Magnets...clever dude, see what I mean about creativity <img src="http://acme-people-search-forum.com/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"></p>

In my opinion, I would think those that do really well would want to help those who are not and possibly share their referrals with these (provided there is evidence of hard work by the individual). It makes sense to me, but unfortunately, our society is built around making as much as you can as quick as you can. Shouldn't we bring others along with us, though, making an even better society? </p><p>Jamen McGranahan<br>jmcgranahan at tds dot net</p></blockquote></div><br><p>Yes Jamen,&nbsp; with programs like GDI forced matrix and now GVO you are working with a team that wants you to succeed. We are helping each other build the downline but you are expected to help too.</p><p>If you are having trouble then it would be in your Sponsors best interest to help guide you. Again, they can't hand you the magic keywords and ads and articles and blogs etc.. but they can tell you what methods are working for them and give you some guidance.&nbsp; For me I like capture pages, and email marketing and PPC. I've tried my hand at video marketing but I have some trouble with it. I need to write more articles and blogs personally so I have not acheived the results that I want to either.&nbsp; It will come in time when I am ready.&nbsp; Work at your own pace but don't stop learning and trying.</p><p>The forum is here to do just that as well but it's up to you to study with an education site like Wealthy Affiliates to learn these methods on your own and apply your own creativity as I mentioned in the previous post.</p>

						<p>Hi donya</p><p>If you complete all 3 steps that you should wait for Tissa to confirm your step3 manually. It takes 24h-72h.<br>Once he confirmed your step 3 look in your APS account under referrals tab. There look belove in "Payable Account Balance" there you can see your $125.</p><p>Remember that you will not find any business that you do nothing and you will earn money. You must give a little from you to get something back.</p>
