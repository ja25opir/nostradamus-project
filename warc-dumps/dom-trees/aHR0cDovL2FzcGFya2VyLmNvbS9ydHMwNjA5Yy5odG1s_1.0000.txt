    <h2>The New Way of Work</h2>
    <p>There are many who are predicting that after this downturn in the economy 
      the workplace will look different from the one we've known. Peter Weddle, 
      a job board expert and writer on career topics sees a workplace with fewer 
      permanent workers. </p>
    <p>Weddle says that employers are hit with a depressed bottom line as well 
      as rapid changes in customer tastes and needs. To respond to both in a cost 
      effective way these employers see that they will need only a core of full 
      time employees. He says that only the most talented workers will have those 
      full time jobs. </p>
    <p>Other workers will have short term project assignments and will be hired 
      with the full understanding that the job ends on a particular date or at 
      a specific occurrence. These too will be highly qualified and talented workers 
      but they will have no guarantee from the company of long term employment. 
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to read the full article entitled <em><strong>Micro Careers</strong></em> 
      you can <a href="http://www.weddles.com/seekernews/issue.cfm?Newsletter=246" target="_blank">read 
      it on his website</a>.<br>
      Use your current job search as a model for the future</p>
    <p>Those of you who are unemployed right now are probably groaning at this 
      prediction. Actually however some of the necessary steps in your current 
      job search will help you in the future. The whole job search process is 
      something you will need to get good at. Now is the time to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Take an inventory of your own skills and determine the ones that will 
        be important in the future.</li>
      <li> Use the company research you've done for your job search to understand 
        the trends in your industry</li>
      <li> Learn where the opportunities are and where they are likely to be in 
        the future</li>
      <li> Get additional training in skill areas you determine will be needed 
        in the future</li>
      <li> Build your network of contacts for current and future use </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What changes will you have to make? </h3>
    <p>How will this change impact you in the future? The majority of workers 
      will have to do many job searches. This may mean having 10-15 job changes 
      over the course of your work life. What will that mean for you in terms 
      of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Learning new skills?</li>
      <li> Paying for your training?</li>
      <li> Saving for the future?</li>
      <li> Understanding and using trending information?</li>
      <li> Marketing and branding yourself?</li>
      <li> Having Health Insurance? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the Weddle article puts these ideas into the present economy, I wrote 
      an article similar to Peter's in 2001 entitled <em><strong>Your Career Is 
      Your Business</strong></em>. <a href="samples9.html">You will find it here.</a> 
      We have been moving slowly in this direction for the past 8 or 9 years. 
      The economic downturn and the failure of many large well established companies 
      makes this kind of change even more likely now. The time is right for this 
      new way to work. Will you be ready? </p>
