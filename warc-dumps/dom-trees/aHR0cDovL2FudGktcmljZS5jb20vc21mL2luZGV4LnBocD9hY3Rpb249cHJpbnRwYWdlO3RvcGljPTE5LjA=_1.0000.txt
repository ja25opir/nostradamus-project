But if anyone wants to join, let me know.<br>&nbsp;<br><hr><br><div align="center">(http://angdar.com/nightsomen/Themes/BlackRainV2118/images/myslogan.jpg) (http://angdar.com/nightsomen)<br>Basic World Information (http://angdar.com/nightsomen/index.php?topic=3.0) || n00b-friendly Night's Omen (http://angdar.com/nightsomen/index.php?topic=885.0) || Face Claim (http://angdar.com/nightsomen/index.php?topic=730.0) || Rules (http://angdar.com/nightsomen/index.php?topic=2.0)<br><br>I'm sure you're confident in your awareness of the world around you. &nbsp;Why wouldn't you be? &nbsp;You hear stories of vampires, see them in the movies, watch as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt run around sucking on cute little dogs and pretty Southern women, and you laugh at the weirdos out there who claim that vampires are real. &nbsp;Why wouldn't you? &nbsp;If you hadn't seen a vampire for yourself, you'd never even consider that they were real.<br><br>Wanna see one?<br><br>I come to you from a world where vampires exist, and they'll do whatever the Hell they want unless someone stands up to stop them. &nbsp;Yeah, they make some rules of their own so that they don't get caught, but they get away with murder. &nbsp;Pardon the pun. &nbsp;If you come with me, you'll see them, and so, <i>so</i> much more. &nbsp;You'll see shapeshifters of all kinds, witches, and a few brave humans in the mix who know exactly what's going on, and try their best to make it safe for the rest of us. &nbsp;Don't believe me? &nbsp;Come and see, baby.<br><br>Night's Omen is an advanced-professional level RPG, meaning that intermediate level roleplayers and those who have been writing for many years will both find themselves welcome. &nbsp;We have a strong core of players who are all very experienced and very willing to welcome new players into the fold. &nbsp;As with any decent game, we like to see dynamic characters and profiles, and love both random encounters and solid, detailed plotlines. &nbsp;The characters on our board are always intertwined and finding themselves in lovely plots and intriguing situations.<br><br>And now, we'd like to invite you to join us.<br><br>(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v515/DarrenDarkstarr/NO/NOmedbanner1.jpg) (http://angdar.com/nightsomen)</div><br><br><hr><br><div align="center"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><font size="5" style="line-height: 1.3em;"><i>I can hear what you're thinking, all your doubts and fears. &nbsp;If you look in my eyes, in time you'll find the reason I'm here.</i></font></span><br><br>(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v515/DarrenDarkstarr/Board%20graphics/vkcityad.png) (http://z6.invisionfree.com/VeilKeepers/index.php)<br><br><span style="font-family: georgia;"><font size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em;">Welcome to New York City, a hub of modern civilization, as well as being a hotspot for supernatural activity. &nbsp;The world isn't nearly as safe and well-lit as we're led to believe, with vampires lurking in the shadows, angels and demons battling for influence over us foolish mortals and the fae folk stealing amused glances from the decadence of the Court. &nbsp;The Veil Keepers manage to shield us all from the sometimes dark reality of the world we live in, but for how long can they hold the veil over our eyes?</font><br><br><font size="4" style="line-height: 1.3em;"><i>And in time all things shall pass away, in time, you may come back someday. &nbsp;To live once more, or die once more, but in time your time will be no more.</i></font><br><br><font size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em;">The 'foolish mortals' aren't entirely without a way of looking after themselves. &nbsp;Some have developed magic of their own over the years, and still others just seem to have <i>talent</i>. &nbsp;These psychics have been growing in number, cropping up where they're least expected, making humans more than just victims waiting to happen. &nbsp;They stand a fighting chance, but it's making discretion more difficult for the Veil Keepers.<br><br>The organization is fighting to keep the monsters where they belong; under the bed, in the closet and out of the spotlight, but when the monsters don't want to cooperate and some people are starting to <i>want</i> to believe, who's to stop them? &nbsp;It's becoming more difficult by the day, more obvious that something is stirring in the dark, and all we can do is wait, and hope.<br><br>Veil Keepers is a literate role-playing game based in an original setting. &nbsp;We're newly opened, with unique character opportunities, a small, friendly staff and a welcoming environment. &nbsp;We're interested in experienced RPers who are up for some great plotting, and hope to see you there.</font><br><br><font size="4" style="line-height: 1.3em;"><i>I can hear what you're thinking.</i></font><br><br><font size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em;">|world overview (http://z6.invisionfree.com/VeilKeepers/index.php?showtopic=5)| |vk bestiary (http://z6.invisionfree.com/VeilKeepers/index.php?showtopic=266)| |character application (http://z6.invisionfree.com/VeilKeepers/index.php?showtopic=262)|</font></span></div></div>
