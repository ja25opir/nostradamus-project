<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning and thank you for joining me. Many of 
you in this room are my friends. Many [of you in] this room know me. Many of you 
have cheered for me or you worked with me or you supported me.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to say to each 
of you, simply and directly: I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish 
behavior I engaged in.<br>
<br>
I know people want to find out how I could be so selfish and so foolish. People 
want to know how I could have done these things to my wife, Elin, and to my 
children. And while I have always tried to be a private person, there are some 
things I want to say.<br>
<br>
Elin and I have started the process of discussing the damage caused by my 
behavior. As Elin pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the 
form of words. It will come from my behavior over time. We have a lot to 
discuss; and -- however, what we say to each other will remain between the two of us.<br>
<br>
I am also aware of the pain my behavior has caused to those of you in this room. 
I have let you down; and I've let down my fans. For many of you, especially my 
friends, my behavior has been a personal disappointment. To those of you who 
work for me, I have let you down personally and professionally.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">My behavior has 
caused considerable worry to my business partners.
To everyone involved in my foundation, including my staff, board of directors, 
sponsors and most importantly, the young students we reach, our work is more 
important than ever. Thirteen years ago, my dad and I envisioned helping young 
people achieve their dreams through education. This work remains unchanged and 
will continue to grow. From the Learning Center students in Southern California 
to the Earl Woods scholars in Washington, D.C., millions of kids have changed 
their lives, and I am dedicated to making sure that continues.<br>
<br>
But still, I know I have bitterly disappointed all of you. I have made you 
question who I am and how I could have done the things I did. I am embarrassed 
that I have put you in this position.<br>
<br>
For all that I have done, I am so sorry.<br>
<br>
I have a lot to atone for, but there's one issue I really want to discuss. Some 
people have speculated that Elin somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving 
night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. Elin never 
hit me that night or any other night. There has never been an episode of 
domestic violence in our marriage -- ever! Elin has shown enormous grace and poise 
throughout this ordeal. Elin deserves praise, not blame.<br>
<br>
The issue involved here was my repeated irresponsible behavior. I was 
unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated. What I did is not acceptable, and I am the 
only person to blame.<br>
<br>
I stopped living by the core values that I was taught to believe in. I knew my 
actions were wrong, but I convinced myself that normal rules didn't apply. I 
never thought about who I was hurting. Instead, I thought only about myself. I 
ran straight through the boundaries that a married couple should live by. I 
thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to. I felt that I had worked 
hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt 
I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have far -- I didn't have to go far to find them.<br>
<br>
I was wrong. I was foolish. I don't get to play by different rules. The same 
boundaries that apply to everyone apply to me. I brought this shame on myself. I 
hurt my wife, my kids, my mother, my wife's family, my friends, my foundation, 
and kids all around the world who admired me.<br>
<br>
I've had a lot of time to think about what I've done. My failures have made -- 
have made me 
look at myself in a way I never wanted to before. It's now up to me to make 
amends and that starts by never repeating the mistakes I've made. It's up to me 
to start living a life of integrity.<br>
<br>
I once heard, and I believe it's true: It's not what you achieve in life that 
matters; it's what you overcome. Achievements on the golf course are only part 
of setting an example. Character and decency are what really count.<br>
<br>
Parents used to point to me as a role model for their kids. I owe all those 
families a special apology. I want to say to them that I am truly sorry.<br>
<br>
It's hard to admit that I need help -- but I do. For 45 days from the end of 
December to early February, I was in inpatient therapy receiving guidance for 
the issues I'm facing. I have a long way to go. But I've taken my first steps in 
the right direction.<br>
<br>
As I proceed, I understand people have questions. I understand the press wants 
me -- want to ask me for the details of the times I was unfaithful. I understand people 
want to know whether Elin and I will remain together. Please know that as far as 
I'm concerned, every one of these questions and answers is a matter between Elin 
and me. These are issues between a husband and a wife.<br>
<br>
Some people have made up things that never happened. They said I used 
performance-enhancing drugs. This is completely and utterly false. Some have 
written things about my family. Despite the damage I have done, I still believe 
it is right to shield my family from the public spotlight. They did not do these 
things -- I did.<br>
<br>
I have always tried to maintain a private space for my wife and children. They 
have been kept separate from my sponsors, my -- my commercial endorsements. When my 
children were born, we only released photographs so they -- so that the paparazzi could not 
chase them. However, my behavior doesn't make it right for the media to follow 
my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter to school and report the school's location. 
They staked out my wife and they pursued my mom. Whatever my wrongdoings, for 
the sake of my family, please leave my wife and kids alone.<br>
<br>
I recognize I have brought this on myself, and I know above all I am the one who 
needs to change. I owe it to my family to become a better person. I owe it to 
those closest to me to become a better man. That's where my focus will be.
I have a lot of work to do, and I [in]tend to dedicate myself to doing it.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of 
following this path for me is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">
<font color="#0000FF">Buddhism</font></a>, which my mother taught me at a young 
age. People probably don't realize it, but I was raised a Buddhist, and I 
actively practiced my faith from childhood until I drifted away from it in 
recent years. Buddhism teaches that a craving for things outside ourselves 
causes an unhappy and pointless search for security. It teaches me to stop 
following every impulse and to -- and to learn restraint. Obviously, I lost track of what 
I was taught.<br>
<br>
As I move forward, I will continue to receive help because I have learned that's 
how people really do change. Starting tomorrow, I will leave for more treatment 
and more therapy. I would like to thank my friends at 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture"><font color="#0000FF">Accenture</font></a> and the players 
in the field this week for understanding why I'm making this -- these remarks today.<br>
<br>
In therapy, I've learned the importance of looking at my spiritual life and 
keeping in balance with my professional life. I need to regain my balance and be 
centered, so I can save the things that are most important to me -- my marriage 
and my children.<br>
<br>
That also means relying on others for help. I've learned to seek support from my 
peers in therapy, and I hope someday to return that support to others who are 
seeking help. I do plan to return to golf one day. I just don't know when that 
day will be.<br>
<br>
I don't rule out that it will be this year. When I do return, I need to make my 
behavior more respectful of the game. In recent weeks, I have received many 
thousands of e-mails, letters, and phone calls from people expressing good 
wishes. To everyone who has reached out to me and my family, thank you. Your 
encouragement means the world to Elin and me.<br>
<br>
I want to thank the PGA Tour, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Finchem">
<font color="#0000FF">Commissioner Finchem</font></a>, and the players, for their 
patience and understanding while I work on my private life. I look forward to 
seeing my fellow players on the course.<br>
<br>
Finally, there are many people in this room, and there are many people at home 
who believed in me. Today, I want to ask for your help. I ask you to find room 
in your heart to one day believe in me again.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</font></p>
