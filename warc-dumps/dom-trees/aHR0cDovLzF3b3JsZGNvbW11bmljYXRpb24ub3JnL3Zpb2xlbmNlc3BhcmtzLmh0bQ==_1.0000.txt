       <b><font color="#7F0000">American Jews are showing more interest in 
       sending money to Israel's Arab minority than they did before the 
       October violence inside Israel's borders that left 13 Israeli Arab 
       citizens dead. In yet another new development, U.S. Jewry is showing 
       greater support for all-Arab projects, as opposed to Jewish-Arab 
       cooperative programs, than they used to. In contrast to the past, 
       this trend is not only prevalent among organizations with a liberal 
       image, such as the New Israel Fund (NIF), but also includes the more 
       conservative Jewish Federation.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">Various Jewish organizations are looking at 
       projects to underwrite in the future and developing public relations 
       strategies Jewish Americans to giving Jewish Federation funds to Arab 
       causes.Protests by Israeli Arabs in early October prodded American 
       Jewish groups to commit to improving Jewish-Arab relations and the 
       status of Arabs as Israeli citizens and even as a national minority. 
       Organizations with a history in this area, such as the New Israel 
       Fund or the Abraham Fund, are re-organizing their involvement in Arab-sector
        projects.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The Abraham Fund, which finances projects 
       aimed at Jewish-Arab coexistence, is undergoing a "conceptual 
       revision," according to executive vice-president Dan Pattir. The 
       fund's intention is to increase the donor pool, give preference to 
       projects that will help "mend the tears" between Jews and 
       Arabs, and to try to match up individual American donors with 
       specific projects that suit their inclinations. One option the 
       Abraham Fund is looking into is a program for education toward 
       coexistence, including production of a television series on the 
       subject in Hebrew and Arabic, and the establishment of a database.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The NIF, which has paid for projects in the 
       Arab sector since its founding 20 years ago - such as setting up and 
       backing Arab non-profit organizations - is researching Israeli Arab-sector
        needs to help frame a strategy for expediting high-priority 
       projects. "We are examining at depth how to help Arab citizens 
       in areas encouragement and the like," said Eliezer Yaari, NIF 
       director in Israel. Yaari said there is increased interest in 
       increasing investment in the private sector both from the fund's 
       directors in Israel and from American benefactors who were alarmed by 
       the deterioration in relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">To help increase American Jewish awareness 
       of the problems of Israel's Arab minority, the NIF asked Leonard 
       Fein, a liberal American Jewish leader, to devise an appropriate 
       public relations strategy. Fein, who was in Israel recently, said he 
       intends to focus on the issue of the civil status of Israeli Arabs 
       and to create a parallel between the American civil rights movement 
       and the struggle of Israeli Arabs for equal rights.</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">NIF officials hope their efforts will 
       prepare the hearts and minds, not only of liberal supporters in 
       America, but chiefly of the more conservative wing of America's Jews. 
       "Civil rights and civil equality are perhaps the most basic 
       elements of the American ethos, and they are instilled in anyone who 
       has finished high school," said NIF public relations head Itzik 
       Shanan. Jesse Krasnow, head of a new United Jewish Appeal-Federation 
       of New York task-force to explore Jewish-Arab relations, echoed 
       Shanan. Krasnow, who was in Israel about two weeks ago, said he and 
       his colleagues concluded that, "Programs of people just talking 
       to each other are unsufficient."</font></b></p>
      <p>
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The UJA-Federation of New York wants to 
       support projects that will empower Israel's Arab citizens, while 
       closing the economic gaps between them and the Jewish sector, Krasnow 
       said. It is looking for ways to expand its support for Israeli Arabs, 
       and may even "devise a model that will serve as an example for 
       other federations in this area." The Jewish Federation of San 
       Francisco has supported Israeli Arab projects for years, and Jewish 
       activists there say the decision of their New York counterparts to 
       follow their lead is very significant: New York's Jewish community is 
       the largest and most powerful in America - it sets the tones in many 
       ways - and has an image of being a relatively conservative community. 
       So what it does, others will follow.</font></b></p>
      <p align="LEFT">
       <b><font color="#7F0000">The new initiaves by the various U.S. Jewish 
       Federations to aid Israeli Arabs are still in the early stages, and 
       no real fundraising in this area has begun yet. "These things 
       have certainly not yet reached a stage of ripeness," said 
       Krasnow. The president and CEO of United Jewish Communities, Stephen 
       Solender, also emphasized this is not yet an organized initiative by 
       his organization, but rather local initiatives by a few federations. 
       The United Jewish Communities still believes an intensive public 
       relations campaign must precede planning or implementation any 
       initiative in this area, he said.</font></b></p>
