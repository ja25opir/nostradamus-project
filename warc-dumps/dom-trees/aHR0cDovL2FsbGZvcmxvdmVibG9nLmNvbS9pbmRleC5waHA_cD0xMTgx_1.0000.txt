<p>The We Are the World remake for Haitian relief is set to debut tonight during NBC’s coverage of the Vancouver Winter Olympics. The timing of this remake couldn’t have been more perfect, what with it being the&nbsp;25th anniversary of the original recording, the loss of Michael Jackson this past year heightening awareness of the original charity single, and the tragedy in Haiti reminding us of the need to pull together for the sake of humanity.</p>
<p>Although Michael Jackson is largely recognized now as&nbsp;one half of the team that wrote We Are the World and as a significant factor in spearheading the success of the project, few people realize the true story of just how hard Michael fought to be a part of We Are The World-and just how significant his contribution, both to the song and to the project, actually was.</p>
<p>I remember the original quite well. It was 1985, and the whole world was focused on the small African country of Ethiopia, a country caught up in a terrible famine that was decimating the population. Children were dying by the hundreds, daily. It was the year of the great, high-profile celebrity fundraisers, with projects such as Live Aid and Band-Aid (in the UK) raising money and awareness on an unprecedented level.</p>
<p>The project began as the brainchild of Harry Belafonte and Ken Kragen, who had the idea of a celebrity supergroup to be known as USA For Africa. They contacted several celebrities to come on board-but not Michael Jackson. Not initially. That would not come about until Quincy Jones had come on board to produce the single, and Lionel Ritchie had been drafted to write the song.</p>
<p>Ritchie’s initial involvement came about largely as a direct result of being one of Kragen’s clients, as was Kenny Rogers (they were both the first two musicians originally contacted). At the time, Michael Jackson was so far below their radar that they had originally agreed for the song to be written as a partnership between Ritchie and Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p>But that changed when Lionel Ritchie put in a call to his pal Michael. Michael, of course, was still riding the crest of his Thriller success and it was natural that he would be called to participate. But as it turned out, Michael had been doing some deep thinking about We Are the World, and he&nbsp;didn’t want to just be a participant-he wanted to&nbsp;be one of the song’s writers.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a risk at the time, although Michael had already proven himself a capable songwriter with hits such as Don’t Stop Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, and Beat It. But still, at the time, his track record as a songwriter compared to that of Ritchie and Wonder was substantially smaller. In other words, he still had a ways to go to prove himself.</p>
<p>In some ways the project fell into Michael’s lap at precisely the right time, a time in which he was grappling with issues of fame and responsibility. Even then, he was acquiring a reputation as one of pop’s most generous benefators and humanitarians. Throughout his life, Michael would go on to support over 39 charities, donating more than $300 million.&nbsp; Here is a wonderful article that breaks down and details much of his humaitarian work:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesource.com/2009/06/the-source-remembers-michael-jackson-humanitarian/">http://www.thesource.com/2009/06/the-source-remembers-michael-jackson-humanitarian/</a></p>
<p>But even as a small child, long before he was even fully aware of the power of his fame or what his amassed wealth could accomplish as an adult, he seemed possessed of an unusually sensitive and advanced desire to help humanity. A child who himself didn’t have a heck of a whole lot in the way of material comforts (at least, not until things took off with The Jackson 5) he still worried that there were other children in the world who were suffering. He often spoke of wanting to have “a big castle” in which all the poor people could come and live. Even as a youth, he would speak of his desire to someday “adopt a girl and a boy from every country in the world.” My own personal theory is that Michael was an indigo child, a child who even then, at that age, was&nbsp;already in touch with what some call “the divine inner self.” I wrote about this more extensively in my blog “Michael Jackson: Messiah Complex or Child of God?” which you can read here if you missed it earlier:</p>
<p><a href="http://allforloveblog.com/?p=634">http://allforloveblog.com/?p=634</a></p>
<p>Of course, there may have been practical reasons as well. I’m sure that in 1985, the year when it was cool and hip for every big-name artist to be involved in a cause for world hunger, he wasn’t blind to the advantages of increasing his profile, especially knowing it would help &nbsp;keep him in the public eye between albums. But I think that, in addition to sincerely wanting to be part of the We Are The World cause, he was also seeing it as a prime opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something that was going to be potentially huge.</p>
<p>The song itself, for starters. Before it was even written, Michael had some very strong ideas of what it should be. He wanted to create an anthem, but one that would be instantly recognizable and easy to sing. In this, Lionel Ritchie was in agreement, but Michael overall seemed to have a much stronger vision of what the song should be-almost as if he had already channeled it and was now simply faced with the task of how to get it down in some tangible form.</p>

<p>Thanks to Michael’s persistence, he was finally allowed on board the songwriting team, which ended up dwindling down to Ritchie and Michael after Stevie Wonder had to pull out due to other obligations. The two went to work on the song, working long hours every night at Hayvenhurst. But LaToya, who was there throughout much of the proceedings, swears that the song’s lyrics&nbsp;were almost 99% Michael’s creation.</p>
<p>This passage from the song’s wiki page describes the process of how the song came together:</p>
<p><strong>Jackson’s older sister, </strong><a title="La Toya Jackson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Toya_Jackson"><strong>La&nbsp;Toya</strong></a><strong>, watched the two work on the song, and later revealed that Richie only wrote a few lines for the track.<sup id="cite_ref-tara_342_3-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World#cite_note-tara_342-3">[4]</a></sup> She stated that her younger brother wrote 99&nbsp;percent of the lyrics, “but he’s never felt it necessary to say that”.<sup id="cite_ref-tara_342_3-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World#cite_note-tara_342-3">[4]</a></sup> La&nbsp;Toya further commented on the song’s creation in an interview with the American celebrity news magazine <em><a title="People (magazine)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)">People</a></em>. “I’d go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael’s usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them.”<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_109_4-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World#cite_note-Campbell_109-4">[5]</a></sup></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Richie had recorded two melodies for “We Are the World”, which Jackson took, adding music and words to the song in the same day. Jackson stated, “I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing, I couldn’t wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed—drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus.”<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_110_5-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World#cite_note-Campbell_110-5">[6]</a></sup> Jackson then presented his </strong><a title="Demo (music)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(music)"><strong>demo</strong></a><strong> to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of “We Are the World” within two and a half hours, one night before the song’s first recording session…</strong></p>

<p>Later, during the recording and video shoot, there would be some controversy when Michael insisted on recording his own part of the song separately, and also over his insistence that in the video, he was to be filmed from “the socks up.” With typical MJ humor, Michael joked that his socks were too distinctive to be ignored. “People will know me as soon as they see the socks,” Michael said. “Try taking footage of Bruce Sprinsteen’s socks and see if anyone knows who they belong to.”</p>

      </div><p class="wp-caption-text">On The We Are The World Set: Was There Really Bud In That Can? White wine? Diet Coke? Or Just Another MJ Prank?</p></div>
<p>All joking aside, We Are The World would go on to become the biggest selling charity single in history, thanks in no small measure to Michael’s powerful and memorable anthem. (And seeing as how Michael did contribute the bulwark of the song, I don’t feel too bad in calling it “his” anthem). As a song, We Are The World isn’t perfect. It’s everything that serious music critics hate about…well, songs like it. A no-holds-barred, sentimental wallop, its “save the world” message isn’t going to be appreciated by everyone, especially the world’s cynics, of which there are many. However, the song served its purpose. It was anthemic; it was inspiring; it stirred in people a desire to make a change. If one doubts just how succesful We Are The World was, one need only look at what happened when the foundation foolishly attempted to replace it with a new and inferior song for Hands Across America, which fell flat.</p>
<p>As for the success of We Are The World-the record-breaking&nbsp;amount of money it raised for famine relief and the very real difference both the organization and single made-that has all been well documented enough. We Are The World set the precedent for years to come&nbsp;of musicians bringing awareness to world plights, and to this day, nothing has equaled it, although the 2010 remake for Haitian relief may come close. Michael will still be a part of it, both in spirit and literally, as his original vocal in the song will still be used, along with a new recording of his part sung by Janet.</p>
<p>I still don’t know for sure if the rumor of Prince and Paris’s participation has been confirmed, but I guess we’ll know for sure after tonight.</p>
<p>However, it will be a fitting way to bring things full circle if they are indeed part of the remake. Very few songs have the power to truly make a difference or to bring about world change. This one did. But it would never have seen the light had it not been for one young man’s determination to make himself heard, and to not be ignored.&nbsp;And even long before that,&nbsp;had it not been for&nbsp;a little boy’s determination-taking root all those years ago in Gary, Indiana-to make this planet a better place, for our children and for ourselves.</p>
