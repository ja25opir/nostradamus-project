    <small>To whom it may concern:</small><br>
    <small><br>
    I am a freshman in college. I am doing&nbsp; a paper concerning abortion and I happend to
    come across your site.&nbsp; Being completely prolife, I was relieved when I realized your
    site was not supporting the choice of abortion.&nbsp; I agree that education is important
    and that most people who are truly educated about abortion will agree that it is wrong.
    &nbsp; I know that there are some people who need to see the pictures on your website - it
    is the only way they'll turn away from abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I disagree with some
    of the aspects of your website. The format and the pictures on you initial page almost
    makes abortion look like a casual issue.&nbsp; True, if you go further into the site,
    you'll realize that this isn't true. But for instance, "wacky ways to do
    abortions" looks like it should be a fun thing.&nbsp; Another thing is the "win
    great prizes."&nbsp; Abortion is a very serious issue, and to think that it can be
    made into a quiz game is appalling.<br>
    Finally, the pictures that are found in this site are a problem.&nbsp; I am certain that
    they will turn thousands off to abortions, however I have mixed feelings:&nbsp; I feel at
    the same time that they are exploiting dead children.&nbsp; I am by no means condemning
    your site.&nbsp; I seems as if your intentions are good.&nbsp; It just raised some of
    these questions of ethic in my mind and I would like for you to consider them as well.
    &nbsp; Millions of children are dying and it IS our place to help protect the innocent. We
    just have to be sure that we keep our morals and do not lower our standards while doing
    so.&nbsp; Thank you&nbsp; and God bless your efforts to save innocent children.<br>
    Sincerely<br>
    Micah, AL.</small></font></font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><small>Thanks for your

    I think your site is terrific.&nbsp; I'm doing a report and the information I<br>
    got from your web page is going to help.&nbsp; I also think if a teenage girl<br>
    is going to spread her legs then she should pay the consequences.&nbsp; How can anyone say
    getting an abortion is in the best intrest of the child?&nbsp; If a mother would kill her
    own child so she doesn't have to deal with&nbsp; her mistake then she doesn't deserve that
    child.&nbsp; Thanks for letting me voice my opinion.<br>

    pictures and sites on your page were repulsive they were also necessary...how else can we
    get others to understand the cruelity of abortions?&nbsp; I am 4 mos. pregnant and never
    once did I consider having an abortion, this was my responsibility.&nbsp; I took on the
    responsbility of having sex, I have to take on the&nbsp; consequences of having sex.
    &nbsp; I hope people view your site and&nbsp; realize the horror of abortions and the
    cruelty of them.&nbsp; Maybe your site will be just what some young girl needs to change

    <small>You are so right; it is wonderful that this Website was produced to provide the
    facts of what abortion is.&nbsp; Ask yourself, Annika, which is worse.&nbsp; Showing
    pictures of dead, aborted, babies or being a Doctor who produces dead babies when he
    performs abortions?&nbsp; If there were no abortions(induced) there would be no pictures.

    <br>
    In recent days, I have been looking at your web page.&nbsp; I have a term paper do and my
    subject is on abortion.&nbsp; I currently am going to Smihfield High School in R.I. &nbsp;
    I was completely amazed with the stuff you people put on here.&nbsp; Yes, there is alot of
    great info on here [ which helped me a ton] , but how could you put those poor little
    babies in pictures???&nbsp; I do not blame you, but how could they dispose of them in
    trash bags?? Isn't there a better way to dispose of aborted babies??&nbsp; Furthermore, I
    read those letters of people who have experienced going through one or whatever, and it
    brought me to tears. I feel ambivalent about abortion. This meaning I feel two different
    ways about the situation.&nbsp; I just want all of the people out there who are against
    abortion, to think about one thing .RAPE . Now, what if this happens???? If they make
    abortion illegal, the victim must have the baby, right??&nbsp; Maybe all of you people can
    get up every morning and look into the eyes of the constant reminder of one sorry night,
    but by my morals it is wrong.&nbsp; I am not saying it is right either.&nbsp; I do not
    believe it should be used as a form or method of birth control. Did anyone ever think of
    actually sitting down and making laws to abortion??&nbsp; One like sure it can be legal as
    long as the girl were raped, the mother was going to be harmed, or if there was something
    wrong with the the baby itself. (and rape has to be proven by a doctor ).&nbsp; As far as
    the 'other' girls , once is a mistake, twice is shame on you.<br>
    </small><br>
    <small>Thank you for your time,&nbsp;&nbsp; D.J.H.&nbsp; </small></font><p><font color="#000080"><small>Reader's response:</small></font></p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><small><font color="#000080">Dear D.J.H.,<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one part of your letter you wonder how now dead, unborn
    babies can be disposed of in trash-bags and in an adjacent section you say that if the
    baby was produced in a Rape that it is all right to kill her.&nbsp; You say you are
    ambivalent; it sounds like culture confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we as individuals grow to maturity we are continually, almost,
    making decisions about our life and about how we wish to react to others with whom we may
    have casual or more lasting relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the young boy who fills your
    drink order at Sonic to your Brother, who will not leave you alone when your new boyfriend
    comes to visit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every situation there is always an opportunity to show love, the way<br>
    Jesus commands that we react and interact with others.&nbsp; An unplanned pregnancy gives
    the Mother and the Father the chance to show real love by welcoming new life to the world
    and either becoming true nurturing parents or gracing the lives of a couple who cannot but
    want to be parents by allowing them to adopt.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the choice is to have the life of your new baby ended, where is the<br>
    love in that?&nbsp; If pregnant because of Rape, why should the truly only<br>
    innocent person, who didn't even exist at the time of the crime, pay with his life?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D, it sounds like this site, AbortionTV, has started you thinking about<br>
    what our society, embracing it has been said a culture of death, values and what we, who
    are to be people of love, should value most.&nbsp; What should we value most, D?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; To Answer that question,&nbsp; answer this one:&nbsp; What is the single
    possession that every human has and that by right should not be taken away?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct D, if you said, life and it is through life that we have being
    and<br>
    can mean to others what they mean to us with love. <br>
    <br>
    God Bless You,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prayers and Peace,<br>

    many, many people some of which have children (had 1 abortion) now that are pleased that
    they chose when the best time to have their "wanted children" was to happen.
    While many can make life, the quality of life is most key once and if you decide to bear
    children. Our government is full of people that can't be productive, laced with social
    problems relating to definite DNA matches that were not made in heaven, but by accident.
    We all are paying for it every day we work in tax dollars. </small><br>

    <font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">There are some that share your sentiments about people

    perhaps the tonight’s evening news about Kosovo) </font></small></p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial"><small>Babies and children are wonderful when people can responsibly provide for them.

    </small></font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000"><br>
    <small>"Life" is not in the best interest of the child? Here’s a quote by
    Sidney J. Harris: " When I hear somebody sigh that "life is hard," I am
    always tempted to ask, "Compared to what?" </small></font></p><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
    </font><p><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000"><small>Here’s our solution: Why not leave the decision up to the child? Wait until
    they’re about three, and ask <i>her or him </i>if they want to be killed. </small></font><font face="Arial"></font></p><font face="Arial">
    <p><small>I support conscientious abortions that are done in 6 to 8 weeks time. Many women
    through natural causes have miscarriages much after that period, ask them what they found,
    yes life, but not much more than a clot formation that was discarded and certainly not
    given a funeral. </small></p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial"></font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000"><small>This is a reminder of why AbortionTV
    exists. What happens at 8 weeks plus one minute? Did this mass of tissue magically become
    a human being? (Please see <a href="AbortionPictures1.htm">Abortion Pictures</a> for an
    educational refresher). At what point in a human’s life is it "alright" to
    kill them? Why not kill them up until 8 <i>years</i>? There are bound to be good reasons
    if we think hard enough. Or maybe up until 18 or even <i>80</i> years? We can even ask for
    a new Supreme Court decision – "Roe vs. Anyone We Don’t Want Here"</small></font></p><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">

    </font><p><font face="Arial"><small>Like many things in life, I do believe the degree of a matter has to be<br>
    weighed very carefully. Hopefully in the next 5 years, women will be able<br>
    to take a pill that will allow them to make a conscientious decision the<br>
    day after conception. It will eliminate the need for all of the abortion<br>
    methods used, and hopefully years from now all of this will be very<br>
    prehistoric looking. </small></font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000"></font></p><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">

    is TERRIBLE, MINDLESS, and IGNORANT. I came upon your site while doing research for a
    government class. I was sickened by the site. I am a very educated, smart, FREE woman. You
    are attempting to take away a woman's choice and therefore take away her freedom. It is
    HER BODY and therefore her choice.&nbsp; The fetus during the first trimester is NOT a
    baby as you call it, but a ball of cells. You have no right to say that women who have
    abortions are "murdering their children." My best friend recently had an
    abortion.&nbsp; Although it was not an easy decision, and I am not saying it should be, it
    was rightfully hers. I sat with her through it, and although it was difficult, she was
    doing herself and the fetus within her a favor because at her age she would not be able to
    give a child the life it deserves. Children are abused, neglected, and killed because
    their parents are not ready to be parents. Is it better for a child to suffer in life than
    a fetus to be terminated as a ball of cells? I, along with most of the population and the
    government, think not.&nbsp; In response to attacks on partial birth abortions, they are
    only legal if the mother's life is threatened. I am not saying that you cannot have your
    own opinion, but what I am saying is that attacking women and their right to<br>
    choice is wrong. No one is saying that you have to have an abortion, but what is being
    said is that women have the choice to do whatever they want with their own body. What
    right do you have to dictate another person's life? I am truly sickened by your page and
    hope that people are intelligent enough to realize this site is vicious, cruel, ignorant
    and disgusting. You have no shame and I hope aol shuts you down as quickly as they shut

    things.&nbsp; Abortion makes me sick and I think all these women and doctors and nurses
    are going to pay someday for what they've done!&nbsp; Thanks for listening and letting me
    get that off my chest</small><br>

    now 28 and am becoming a doctor.&nbsp; When I was 18 and in college I became pregnant and
    had an abortion without so much as a second thought.&nbsp; It was a terrible experience.
    It was painful, and worse than that I saw the jar that they vacuumed my baby's parts into.
    I was only 7 weeks pregnant, but I knew that it was not simply "tissue", it was
    a human life. I have never been able to forgive myself and am completely disgusted with
    what I did. I pray that God will forgive me but I don't think that I deserve it. I am
    becoming a physician so that I can save lives, in the hope that somehow I can at least
    partly make up for what I have done.&nbsp; I wish so much that someone had tried to stop
    me. I will never perform an abortion or be at one. If a patient asks for my advice I will
    give it, I don't care what the pro-choicer's think.&nbsp; I do think this site is drastic,
    but people should face the truth about what is going on. &nbsp; Women are not having warts
    removed, they are having babies removed, and you can call it what you want to but there is
    no doubt that a life is ending.&nbsp; I hope that at least one person will see this
    website and reconsider their decision.</small></p>

    have two teen-age daughters. Tonight during dinner the subject of abortion came up. My
    youngest daughter said she didn't understand what's the big deal, it's not a baby yet. I
    explained to her that she was absolutely wrong. Thankfully my older daughter joined me in
    explaining this to her. </small></p>
    <p><small>I told her I would search the Internet and find evidence to prove my point. I
    searched and I found you. Your site is extremely revolting, as it should be. It will be
    required homework tomorrow evening for her to peruse your site. I have no doubt that
    afterward she will understand how wrong abortion is. </small></p>
    <p><small>I thank God that this site exists and that I found it. I hope you have your
    finances in order: Undoubtedly Hillary is going to have you audited. </small></p>
    <p><small>PS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found another article that should interest you and your
    guests. The lie that Hillary and the rest of the pro-infanticide group perpetuate to
    justify infanticide is that the world is going to be overpopulated into ruin. This article
    from the Washington Times 2/10/99 refutes that lie with the truth about fertility rates.
    The title of the article is "Overpopulation Not A Problem in the US And Many
    Countries" and can be found at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.prolife.org/ultimate/news4.html">News Headlines</a> </small></p>

    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial,helvetica" size="2">George, thank you so much for
    your comments. We also appreciate sending along the link to the excellent article on world
    population. We always find it amazing (and sad) how some people promote abortion as a
    "cure-all" for various social problems. Now that population control is not a
    crisis to be "cured" by abortion, we can probably expect something new (and
    ridiculous) to take its place.</font></p>
